When Engelbert Humperdinck scored major hit with "The it used to Be" in 1968\, heard right away that this magnificent melody had all the elements took for 'new' track. obviously wrote new orchestral arrangement\, where after "new easy listening classic" was born :) album "Traces Of Love" from track is taken breathes quality beginning end. Here we can listen 'at his best' bringing tunes an even larger orchestra and audio technicians (eg Peter Klemt) behind controls who make use of newest recording technology available (at time\, ie 1969). If ever term "heavenly music" used\, sure here. created music\, that\, without any doubt\, will please audiences generations come. From 1969 here "Mister Hitmaker" once again you Be". Enjoy. 	0
