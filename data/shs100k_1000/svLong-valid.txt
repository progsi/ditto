The song was the band's first single\, released in August 1979\, and is often considered to be the first gothic rock record released. It did not enter the UK pop charts at that time. The b-side features the song "Boys" and some versions also include an early demo recording of what would be their next single\, "Dark Entries". It was released on CD in 1988 and was compiled on the 1998 album\, Crackle - The Best of Bauhaus. The original sleeve art was taken from a still of the film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.  Recording session  "Bela Lugosi's Dead" was recorded during a six-hour session at Beck Studios in Wellingborough on 26 January 1979. Four more songs were recorded ("Boys"\, "Harry"\, "Dark Entries" and the unreleased "Some Faces") but not used; only "Harry" surfaced in 1982 as a single B-side to "Kick In The Eye".  The song "Boys" was re-recorded at Beck Studios in spring 1979.  Use in film and television  The song was featured in the 1983 Tony Scott cult vampire film The Hunger\, with Bauhaus portraying a band in a nightclub\, playing it during the opening credits and introduction. A 7" promotional record featuring an edited version of the song was released to theaters playing the movie.  It was also played throughout the movie Dead Man's Curve/The Curve\, and featured in the French movie\, Sombre. The song is played in the movie Good Luck Chuck as an introduction for when the Goth girl is on screen and it is on the soundtrack.  The song was used as the intro music for the late 1990s Saturday Night Live skit "Goth Talk"\, which had Chris Kattan and Molly Shannon as two goth students. This song was also in an episode in the fifth season of Smallville\, the vampire/Halloween-themed "Thirst". The song was also in an episode of One Tree Hill.  The song was featured in an episode ("Midnight") of the science fiction/horror series Fringe which revolved around a vampire-esque creature.  Comedian and musician Bill Bailey parodied the song on his DVD Cosmic Jam as part of a medley in which he and his band\, the Stan Ellis Experiment performed Cockney Rock style versions of popular songs - this particular segment of the medley included lyrical changes such as "E ad a girl's name".  The song was played almost in its entirety during the horror film The Collector during a scene in which the older daughter was attempting to have sex with her boyfriend before they were both viciously murdered.  The song was played in the opening scene of the Supernatural television series in season 6\, episode 5\, "Live Free or Twi-Hard". The episode is vampire-themed\, poking particular fun at the Twilight movie series and its romanticism of vampires.  The Illuminoids made a mash-up called Lugosi's Mongoloid Loser with Bela Lugosi's Dead by Bauhaus\, Loser by Beck and Mongolid By Devo.  Ethan Gold also covered it.	0

Oh you have your father's nose\, So crimson in the dark it glows\, If you're not asleep when the boozers close\, You'll gerra belt from your Dad.   You look so scruffy lying dur Strawberry-jam tats in yer 'air\, Though in the world you haven't a care And I have got so many. It's quite a struggle every day Living on your father's pay\, The bugger drinks it all away And leaves me without any.   Although we have no silver spoon\, Better days are coming soon Now Nelly's working at the Lune And she gets paid on Friday. Perhaps one day we'll have a splash\, When Littlewoods provide the cash\, We'll get a house in Knotty Ash And buy your Dad a brewery.   Oh you are a mucky kid\, Dirty as a dustbin lid. When he hears the things you did You'll gerra belt from your Dad. Oh you have your father's face\, You're growing up a real hard case\, But there's no one can take your place\, .... Go fast asleep for yer Mammy.	0

The song peaked at #5 as a single in the band's native UK in January 1989 (it was released on New Year's Day) before hitting #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S. on 15 April 1989. It appeared on The Raw and Cooked album the following month.  It also made number 3 on the Dutch Top 40. A remixed version was released in 1997.  The unique snare drum "pop" sound was created by recording the snare drum portion separately. A speaker was then placed on top of the snare drum\, and a microphone below. The original recording of the snare drum part was played back through the speaker and re-recorded.  Music video  Two music videos were produced for the song\, one by Philippe Decoufl√© and one by Pedro Romhanyi. Similar to Decoufl√©'s only other music video\, New Order's "True Faith"\, his version includes extensive choreography and performers in unusual costumes\, including two identical dancers with completely different coloured-outfits\, as well as a person with a television on their head. This version received several nominations at the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards\, including Best Video.	0

Jack Henderson Clement (April 5\, 1931 ‚Äì August 8\, 2013) was an American singer\, songwriter\, and a record and film producer.  In 1957\, Clement wrote the song "Ballad of a Teenage Queen" that became a crossover hit for Johnny Cash. Other Cash hits written by Clement included "Guess Things Happen That Way"\, which was # 1 country and # 11 pop in 1958\, and the humorous "The One on the Right Is on the Left"\, which was a # 2 country and # 46 pop hit in 1966.

COL title VAL I'd Rather Die Young (Than Grow Old Without You) COL performer VAL Jean Shepard	COL video title VAL Simon & Garfunkel - The Only Living Boy In New York COL channel name VAL kylecrazyford COL description VAL "The Only Living Boy in New York" is a song written by Paul Simon and performed by Simon and Garfunkel. It is the eighth track from the American pop duo's fifth and final studio album\, Bridge Over Troubled Water. The song was also issued as the B-Side to the duo's "Cecilia" single.  Simon wrote this as a thinly-veiled message to Art Garfunkel\, referring to a specific incident where Garfunkel went to Mexico to act in the film Catch-22. Simon was left alone in New York writing songs for Bridge over Troubled Water\, hence the lonely feelings of "The Only Living Boy In New York." Simon refers to Garfunkel in the song as Tom\, referring to their early days when they were called Tom and Jerry\, and encourages him to "let your honesty shine...like it shines on me". The background vocals feature both Garfunkel and Simon recorded together in an echo chamber\, multi-tracked around eight times.	0

Join our Youtube: https://goo.gl/8AOGaN Join our Facebook: http://goo.gl/5oL723 Bob Dylan (/Ààd…™l…ôn/; born Robert Allen Zimmerman\, May 24\, 1941) is an American singer-songwriter\, artist\, and writer. He has been an influential figure in popular music and culture for more than five decades. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s\, when he was both a chronicler and a reluctant figurehead of social unrest. A number of Dylan's early songs\, such as "Blowin' in the Wind" and "The Times They Are a-Changin'"\, became anthems for the American civil rights and anti-war movements. Leaving behind his initial base in the culture of the folk music revival\, Dylan's six-minute single "Like a Rolling Stone" radically altered the parameters of popular music in 1965. His mid-1960s recordings\, backed by rock musicians\, reached the top end of the United States music charts while also attracting denunciation and criticism from others in the folk movement.

COL title VAL Double Trouble COL performer VAL Totta's Bluesband	COL video title VAL Hello Stranger - The Supremes & The Four Tops COL channel name VAL MotownConnoisseur30 COL description VAL Here is another outstanding cover from the third duet album from The Supremes & The Four Tops entitled "Dynamite" from 1971.  Aside from Barbara Lewis' 1963 original\, I think this version is the best of all the covers ever done of the song. It is musical perfection.  Written by: Barbara Lewis Produced by: Bobby Taylor and Frank Wilson Track recorded: May 3\, 1971 Additional overdubs\, strings and horn sessions recorded in Los Angeles: Dates unknown Levi Stubbs lead vocal recorded: June 5\, 1971 & August 17\, 1971 Four Tops background vocals recorded: June 9\, 1971 Jean Terrell lead vocal recorded: June 10\, 1971 Supremes background vocals recorded: June 24\, 1971  This version is the best song on the entire LP and one of the best duets the groups did together over the three albums. Motown was foolish not to release this as a single. It screams hit and would have been one had Motown promoted it\, but at the time The Supremes and The Four Tops were no longer Motown's top priority. Nonetheless\, it still remains an incredible cover.  ****No copyright infringement intended****	0

COL title VAL Angel Baby COL performer VAL Reparata and The Delrons	COL video title VAL Los Yorks - Charo COL channel name VAL Heduardo COL description VAL Carlos Torres Rotondo los describe as√≠: "Los York's eran una banda de garage-psicodelia que tocaba con desparpajo\, ten√≠an atisbos melanc√≥licos\, guitarras punzantes y ritmo furioso y desesperado. Esa rudeza musical con la que se expresaba su actitud estaba impregnada de una belleza y sonido singular. El sonido de la banda ten√≠a claras influencias: The Kinks\, The Yardbirds\, The Troggs y toda la m√∫sica americana que llegaba a sus o√≠dos\, pero la voz de Pablo Luna\, que emerg√≠a con incandescente sensualidad\, los acercaba al rhythm & blues y al soul: cantaba con voz dulce\, c√°lida y acompasada\, pero abruptamente pod√≠a pasar a un cat√°rtico y furibundo paroxismo\, con dosis de verdadera rabia y violencia. El encargado de la primera guitarra y segunda voz\, Walter Paz\, por su parte\, aport√≥ con su ejecuci√≥n un color y un sonido particular: su t√©cnica en la guitarra\, involuntariamente\, lo llev√≥ a espacios sonoros similares a los de un Lou Reed en la √©poca de la Velvet Underground".   Y Javi S√°nchez Pons\, de MondoSonoro.com\, dice de ellos: "Los York's\, peruanos como Los Saicos\, y tan o m√°s locos que los autores de Demolici√≥n\, dejan bien a las claras que Lima era la capital del garage hecho en el Hemisferio Sur en los a√±os sesenta\, y que poco ten√≠a que envidiar a los t√≥tems norteamericanos del estilo\, bandas coet√°neas como The Standells\, Count Five o The Remains. Y es que canciones como "Mira t√∫"\, "Pronto un doctor"\, "No me dejes"\, "Justo a mi gusto" o "No puedo amar"\, tienen el punto justo de descaro\, de salvajismo y de savoir faire para ser considerados verdaderos cl√°sicos".  Los Yorks\, grupo peruano formado en 1966\, uno de los mejores de la mejor √©poca del rock peruano. Hicieron varios discos 45 rpm antes de sus famosos tres long plays: "Los Yorks 67" y "Los Yorks 68" para el sello MAG y "Ritmo y Sentimiento" en 1970 para el sello Virrey. Luego de este tercer disco el grupo se disolvi√≥\, aunque en 1974 se volvieron a reunir para grabar algunos singles como "Ya beb√≠ gran rato" y "Mi mente en ti". Aqu√≠ pueden leer m√°s sobre ellos: http://rockperuanorollos.blogspot.com/search/label/Yorks	0

I rediscovered  some old 35mm negatives wasting away in a box in my attic. Carefully restored them (using Photoshop and a really smart little filter called Noise Ninja). This was one of the easiest compilations of my photographs so far to restore --   This is another show from my attic archives (Original material from 35mm slides photographed by myself some years ago). The originals are Ektachrome slides.  The music for this one is from a single (due to me not being able to find a live recording). Wonder if anyone can identify the line-up here?	0

COL title VAL Please Don't Tell Me How the Story Ends COL performer VAL Freddy Fender	COL video title VAL Sixteen Horsepower w/ Bertrand Cantat - The Partisan COL channel name VAL TinderNikos COL description VAL The song about the French Resistance in World War II was written in 1943 in London by Emmanuel d'Astier de la Vigerie and the music by Anna Marly.  The english lyrics (well known by the classic Leonard Cohen cover) were written by Hy Zaret.  Bertrand Cantat of Noir Desir provides some french vocals...  LYRICS When they poured across the border I was cautioned to surrender\, this I could not do; I took my gun and vanished.  I have changed my name so often\, I've lost my wife and children but I have many friends\, and some of them are with me.  An old woman gave us shelter\, Kept us hidden in the garret\, then the soldiers came; she died without a whisper.  There were three of us this morning I'm the only one this evening but I must go on; the frontiers are my prison.  Oh\, the wind\, the wind is blowing\, through the graves the wind is blowing\, freedom soon will come; then we'll come from the shadows.  Les Allemands √©taient chez moi\, ils me dirent\, "R√©signe toi\," mais je n'ai pas peur; j'ai repris mon √¢me.  (The Germans were at my home They said\, "Sign yourself\," But I am not afraid I have retaken my soul.)  J'ai chang√© cent fois de nom\, j'ai perdu femme et enfants mais j'ai tant d'amis; j'ai la France enti√®re.  (I've changed names a hundred times I have lost wife and children But I have so many friends I have all of France)  Un vieil homme dans un grenier pour la nuit nous a cach√©\, les Allemands l'ont pris; il est mort sans surprise.  (An old man\, in an attic Hid us for the night The Germans captured him He died without surprise.)  Oh\, the wind\, the wind is blowing\, through the graves the wind is blowing\, freedom soon will come; then we'll come from the shadows.	0

COL title VAL Voi voi COL performer VAL Nora Brockstedt	COL video title VAL Al Hirt: Up Above My Head COL channel name VAL davidhertzberg1 COL description VAL From the LP "Sugar Lips\," issued in 1964 by RCA (LPM-2965\, monaural).  Al Hirt (1922-1999)\, trumpet\, with chorus and orchestra.  Recorded in RCA Victor's "Nashville Sound" Studio\, Nashville\, Tennessee.  Produced by Chet Atkins; recording engineer\, Chuck Seitz.  ----------------------------------------------------------- Al Hirt wurde als Sohn eines Polizeibeamten geboren; er war unter dem Namen ‚ÄûAl" oder ‚ÄûJumbo" bekannt. Im Alter von sechs Jahren begann er Trompete zu spielen und mit 16 war er beruflich Trompeter. Im Jahr 1940 ging er nach Cincinnati\, um am dortigen Musikkonservatorium  zu studieren.  Nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg spielte er in mehreren Swing-Big-Bands. W√§hrend der 1960er-Jahre galt Hirt neben Herb Alpert als einer der popul√§rsten Trompeter; er wurde ausgew√§hlt\, die Titelmusik zu der in den 1960er-Jahren laufenden TV-Show The Green Hornet einzuspielen. Dieses St√ºck wurde von Billy May arrangiert\, wobei das Thema auf Nikolai Rimski-Korsakows ‚ÄûHummelflug" basiert\, und bewies Hirts technische Raffinesse. Das St√ºck erlangte wieder an Popularit√§t\, als es 2003 bei Quentin Tarantinos Film Kill Bill Teil des Soundtracks wurde. In New Orleans f√ºhrte er einige Jahre einen eigenen Club.  Hirt starb im Jahr 1999 an Leberversagen\, nachdem er einige Jahre aufgrund eines √ñdems im Rollstuhl verbracht hatte. ----------------------------------------------------------- Al Hirt - ameryka≈Ñski trƒôbacz jazzowy i kierownik zespo≈Çu muzycznego.  Studiowa≈Ç w konserwatorium w Cincinnati. Wystƒôpowa≈Ç jako pierwszy trƒôbacz w zespo≈Çach Tommy Dorseya\, Jimmy'ego Dorseya\, Raya McKinleya. Z racji swojej postury (wa≈ºy≈Ç 130 kg i mia≈Ç 183 cm wzrostu) nosi≈Ç przydomki: "The Monster" i "The King".  Najpopularniejsze nagrania: "Java"\, "Fancy Plants"\, "Just Because"\, "Personality"\, "Panama"\, "Jazz Mr. Blues"\, "Sugar Lips". ----------------------------------------------------------- Al Hirt √©tait le fils d'un officier de police. √Ä l'√¢ge de 6 ans\, il re√ßoit sa premi√®re trompette. Il joue dans le Junior Police Band avec les enfants d'Alcide Yellow Nunez et √† 16 ans\, Hirt joue en tant que professionnel\, souvent avec son ami Pete Fountain. Il est engag√© par un hippodrome voisin pour y jouer.  En 1940\, Hirt se d√©place √† Cincinnati dans l'Ohio pour √©tudier au Cincinnati Conservatory of Music aupr√®s du Dr. Frank Simon (un ancien soliste de l'orchestre de John Philip Sousa). Durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale\, Hirt joue du clairon dans l'arm√©e am√©ricaine\, puis il joue aux c√¥t√©s de plusieurs big bands de swing dont ceux de Tommy Dorsey\, Jimmy Dorsey\, Benny Goodman\, et Ina Rae Hutton. En 1950\, il devient le trompettiste principal de l'orchestre d'Horace Heidt.  Il retourne ensuite √† la Nouvelle-Orl√©ans o√π il aide et m√®ne plusieurs groupes de Dixieland. Malgr√© les d√©clarations de Hirt plusieurs ann√©es plus tard\, Je ne suis pas un trompettiste de jazz et ne fut jamais un trompettiste de jazz\, il enregistra quelques morceaux o√π il montra sa capacit√© √† jouer ce style durant les ann√©es 1950\, en particulier avec Monk Hazel. Il enregistra √©galement pour le label Southland Records.  La dext√©rit√© de Hirt et son style attira rapidement l'attention des labels nationaux. Hirt avait 22 albums dans les Billboard Pop charts durant les ann√©es 50 et 60. Les albums Honey In The Horn et Cotton Candy √©taient tous deux au sommet des charts des meilleures ventes de disque pour l'ann√©e 1964. La m√™me ann√©e\, Hirt r√©ussit √† atteindre le sommet du classement gr√¢ce au morceau Java.	0

His country boogie material was a clear precursor of the style.  Foley has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: one for his recording career at\, 6225 Hollywood Blvd. and one for his television career\, at 6300 Hollywood Blvd. On June 10\, 2003\, a Kentucky State historical marker (No. 2114) was placed at Foley's boyhood home in Berea.  In 2002\, he was inducted into the Kentucky Music Hall of Fame\, where his corncob pipe is on display. In 2006\, his 1951 version of "Peace in the Valley" was entered into the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry.  In 1970\, Berea College established the Red Foley Memorial Music Award. Initiated by his long-time friend and colleague Si Siman\, the annual award is presented to talented Berea College students in recognition of their musical contributions to the campus community. It is intended to promote the music associated with Foley‚Äôs career\, such as folk\, country\, bluegrass\, gospel and popular music.  A dance to Foley's song\, "The Salty Dog Rag"\, has been traditional at Dartmouth College since 1972\, where it is taught to freshman during orientation.[21][22] Cumberland Falls State Park\, in Corbin\, Kentucky\, near Foley's hometown of Berea\, has been playing the song with an accompanying dance at its square dance nights since at least the mid-1970s.  The Rooks Van Dellen Residence Hall at Calvin College has an annual celebration of Red Foley Day in mid-November. The celebration began in 1968 when a few students from the hall heard a radio announcer say\, "Red Foley was a great country music singer\, too bad no one will ever remember him." The day has been celebrated (with a few lapses) to remember Foley ever since.[23][24]  Foley Middle School\, located in Berea near Foley's boyhood home\, opened in 1978 and educates students in southern Madison County in the 6th\, 7th\, and 8th grades. The school retains a large collection of personal items once owned by Foley on display in the library. The collection was donated by members of his family.  Red Foley Court is among several streets in Nixa\, Missouri named for performers on Ozark Jubilee\, and Red Foley Road is in Rockcastle County\, Kentucky\, north of Renfro Valley.[25]  In 2009\, singer/songwriter James Power released a song based on Foley's second wife\, Eva Overstake (aka Judy Martin)\, entitled "A Cowgirl's Suicide" on YouTube.[26] The song was featured in the independent film Laid Off by director John Launchi.	0

COL title VAL Sha-La-La-La-Lee COL performer VAL Small Faces	COL video title VAL Les Terribles - Ce n'est pas une vie COL channel name VAL Matthew East COL description VAL Ready for an amazing 60's dance party? Well\, don't forget to bring this platter to the DJ! This band from Paris\, France plays an incredible mix of 60's garage-punk & GoGo Beat and now finally returns with their second longplayer 'Ils sont formidables!'. The band that includes members of THE NO TALENTS\, LES SYNAPSES\, DUTRONC\, CECILIA UND DIE SAUERKRAUTS & OPERATION S goes back to the sound of the French Beat & Roll when it was bitten by the Big Bad British Bug back in 1965. Imagine how THEM\, THE SMALL FACES\, THE YARDBIRDS or the early STONES would've sound if they were from France\, never turned professionals and Van Morrison\, Keith Relf or Mike Jagger were chicks. All the songs are in French\, with that glamorous 'mademoiselle' accent! The band could've been described best as the great french sixties rock band that should have existed but never did. Owing to cultural impediments and lame business practices\, there were very few outstanding french rockers from that period. Ronnie Bird\, Larry Greco\, and a dozen others you've never heard of: LES TERRIBLES cover them all\, and every song makes you wanna dance. The band rounds out their set with some originals\, as well as their own french versions of some great foreign songs that never got adapted before\, all done with a perfect ear for the style. Fronted by the charming and talented chanteuse Rudie this hard-working orchestre delivers the groove that gets the dance floor moving to the Swim\, the Jerk\, and the Hully-Gully. Les Terribles are sur scene ! ((Jon Dragueur) A Top 10 forever-must have this one is. What more can we tell you?	1

'Spirit of '73: Rock For Choice' was put together by the activist group Feminist Majority with proceeds going to support the Becky Bell/Rosie Jimenez Campaign "to lift consent laws and federal funding restrictions that are forcing young women to turn to back-alley abortions". The compilation's title is inspired by the January 22\, 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion in the United States. The songs included are all contemporary artists of 1995 covering songs that were popular in the early 1970s.   Fun Fact: The producer of the original "Midnight At The Oasis" by Maria Muldaur was none other than That Dog singer/guitarist Anna Waronker's father\, Lenny Waronker.	0

COL title VAL That's How Heartaches Are Made COL performer VAL Loleatta Holloway	COL video title VAL Reel Big Fish - Talkin Bout a Revolution COL channel name VAL Bocky Ralboa COL description VAL Reel Big Fish is an American ska punk band from Huntington Beach\, California\, best known for the 1997 hit "Sell Out." The band gained mainstream recognition in the mid-to-late 1990s\, during the third wave of ska with the release of the album Turn the Radio Off. Since the band's founding in 1992 and their demo In the Good Old Days...\, the only original member remaining is Aaron Barrett.  The band's debut album\, Everything Sucks\, was an underground hit and led to a deal with Mojo Records. The album Turn the Radio Off established the band in the ska punk scene\, and they began touring throughout the United States. After the single "Sell Out" began breaking into the mainstream\, including MTV\, the album made an appearance on the charts. However\, the ska revival was short-lived\, and their 1998 album Why Do They Rock So Hard? did not lead the band into the mainstream. In 1998\, the band appeared in the movie BASEketball\, performing in the stands to pump up the crowd. Why Do They Rock So Hard? was the last album for three members of the band. Trombonist Grant Barry and trumpet player Tavis Werts were either fired or left the band voluntarily\, depending on the source. Drummer Andrew Gonzales left the band to spend more time with his family. Reel Big Fish then had a rotating cast of drummers and trumpeters over the next six years.	0

COL title VAL Home in San Antone COL performer VAL Sons of the Pioneers	COL video title VAL Al Hirt: Up Above My Head COL channel name VAL davidhertzberg1 COL description VAL From the LP "Sugar Lips\," issued in 1964 by RCA (LPM-2965\, monaural).  Al Hirt (1922-1999)\, trumpet\, with chorus and orchestra.  Recorded in RCA Victor's "Nashville Sound" Studio\, Nashville\, Tennessee.  Produced by Chet Atkins; recording engineer\, Chuck Seitz.  ----------------------------------------------------------- Al Hirt wurde als Sohn eines Polizeibeamten geboren; er war unter dem Namen ‚ÄûAl" oder ‚ÄûJumbo" bekannt. Im Alter von sechs Jahren begann er Trompete zu spielen und mit 16 war er beruflich Trompeter. Im Jahr 1940 ging er nach Cincinnati\, um am dortigen Musikkonservatorium  zu studieren.  Nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg spielte er in mehreren Swing-Big-Bands. W√§hrend der 1960er-Jahre galt Hirt neben Herb Alpert als einer der popul√§rsten Trompeter; er wurde ausgew√§hlt\, die Titelmusik zu der in den 1960er-Jahren laufenden TV-Show The Green Hornet einzuspielen. Dieses St√ºck wurde von Billy May arrangiert\, wobei das Thema auf Nikolai Rimski-Korsakows ‚ÄûHummelflug" basiert\, und bewies Hirts technische Raffinesse. Das St√ºck erlangte wieder an Popularit√§t\, als es 2003 bei Quentin Tarantinos Film Kill Bill Teil des Soundtracks wurde. In New Orleans f√ºhrte er einige Jahre einen eigenen Club.  Hirt starb im Jahr 1999 an Leberversagen\, nachdem er einige Jahre aufgrund eines √ñdems im Rollstuhl verbracht hatte. ----------------------------------------------------------- Al Hirt - ameryka≈Ñski trƒôbacz jazzowy i kierownik zespo≈Çu muzycznego.  Studiowa≈Ç w konserwatorium w Cincinnati. Wystƒôpowa≈Ç jako pierwszy trƒôbacz w zespo≈Çach Tommy Dorseya\, Jimmy'ego Dorseya\, Raya McKinleya. Z racji swojej postury (wa≈ºy≈Ç 130 kg i mia≈Ç 183 cm wzrostu) nosi≈Ç przydomki: "The Monster" i "The King".  Najpopularniejsze nagrania: "Java"\, "Fancy Plants"\, "Just Because"\, "Personality"\, "Panama"\, "Jazz Mr. Blues"\, "Sugar Lips". ----------------------------------------------------------- Al Hirt √©tait le fils d'un officier de police. √Ä l'√¢ge de 6 ans\, il re√ßoit sa premi√®re trompette. Il joue dans le Junior Police Band avec les enfants d'Alcide Yellow Nunez et √† 16 ans\, Hirt joue en tant que professionnel\, souvent avec son ami Pete Fountain. Il est engag√© par un hippodrome voisin pour y jouer.  En 1940\, Hirt se d√©place √† Cincinnati dans l'Ohio pour √©tudier au Cincinnati Conservatory of Music aupr√®s du Dr. Frank Simon (un ancien soliste de l'orchestre de John Philip Sousa). Durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale\, Hirt joue du clairon dans l'arm√©e am√©ricaine\, puis il joue aux c√¥t√©s de plusieurs big bands de swing dont ceux de Tommy Dorsey\, Jimmy Dorsey\, Benny Goodman\, et Ina Rae Hutton. En 1950\, il devient le trompettiste principal de l'orchestre d'Horace Heidt.  Il retourne ensuite √† la Nouvelle-Orl√©ans o√π il aide et m√®ne plusieurs groupes de Dixieland. Malgr√© les d√©clarations de Hirt plusieurs ann√©es plus tard\, Je ne suis pas un trompettiste de jazz et ne fut jamais un trompettiste de jazz\, il enregistra quelques morceaux o√π il montra sa capacit√© √† jouer ce style durant les ann√©es 1950\, en particulier avec Monk Hazel. Il enregistra √©galement pour le label Southland Records.  La dext√©rit√© de Hirt et son style attira rapidement l'attention des labels nationaux. Hirt avait 22 albums dans les Billboard Pop charts durant les ann√©es 50 et 60. Les albums Honey In The Horn et Cotton Candy √©taient tous deux au sommet des charts des meilleures ventes de disque pour l'ann√©e 1964. La m√™me ann√©e\, Hirt r√©ussit √† atteindre le sommet du classement gr√¢ce au morceau Java.	0

COL title VAL Sparkling Brown Eyes COL performer VAL Joe Val and The New England Bluegrass Boys	COL video title VAL LUTHER INGRAM-ain't hat loving you(for more reason than one) COL channel name VAL pieroangelo2 COL description VAL Born Luther Thomas Ingram in Jackson\, Tennessee\, his early interest in music led to him making his first record in 1965 at the age of 28. His first three recordings failed to chart but that changed when he signed for KoKo Records in the late 1960s\, and his first hit "My Honey And Me" peaked at #55 on the Hot 100 on 14 February 1970. Many of his songs appeared in the pop and R&B charts\, even though Koko was only a small label\, owned by his manager and record producer\, Johnny Baylor. Koko and Baylor were closely associated with the Memphis based Stax Records label during the height of its commercial success.   Ingram is best known for the hit\, "(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want to Be Right"\, written by Homer Banks\, Carl Hampton and Raymond Jackson. The song reached number one on Billboard 's R&B chart and peaked at number three on that publication's Hot 100 chart in the summer of 1972. The track stayed in the Hot 100 for 18 weeks\, ultimately selling a reported four million copies.[1] The song was later successfully covered by Millie Jackson and Barbara Mandrell; it has also been recorded by Bobby "Blue" Bland\, Rod Stewart and Isaac Hayes.   Other popular tracks for Ingram included "Ain't That Loving You (For More Reasons Than One)"\, "Let's Steal Away To The Hideaway" and "I'll Be Your Shelter." He also co-authored "Respect Yourself"\, a million seller for the Staples Singers in 1971.[1] The acetate demo version of Ingram's\, "Exus Trek"\, became a sought after Northern soul track.[2] With the Stax connections\, Ingram recorded at the Memphis label's studios\, as well as other southern-based studios such as Muscle Shoals. He was opening act for Isaac Hayes for some years\, and often used Hayes' Movement band and female backing group for his 1970s recordings. He recorded into the 1980s\, and whilst only managing lower R&B chart hits\, he remained a popular stage draw.   Ingram died on March 19\, 2007\, at a Belleville\, Illinois\, hospital of heart failure. According to his wife Jacqui Ingram\, he had suffered for years from diabetes\, kidney disease and partial blindness	0

COL title VAL Cherry Bomb COL performer VAL Shonen Knife	COL video title VAL IRENE REID I wonder where our love has gone (1965) COL channel name VAL OubaelPhoumet COL description VAL album : Room for one more.  Room for One More pairs singer Irene Reid with arranger Oliver Nelson and a sprawling who's who of session players including Thad Jones\, Charlie Mariano\, Kenny Burrell\, Phil Woods\, and J.J. Johnson. The title's more than a bit tongue in cheek\, of course\, but given the stature of her collaborators\, Reid no doubt felt some pressure to prove herself worthy of occupying the same studio space\, let alone to claim top billing\, but she does so admirably\, rendering classics like "Save Your Love for Me" and "I Wonder Where Our Love Has Gone" with extraordinary emotional potency. Although best suited for ballads\, most notably a breathtaking reading of "Who Can I Turn To?\," Reid is such a nimble stylist that even a throwaway number like the Bewitched theme still makes its mark. Nelson's spacious arrangements are sublime\, and it almost goes without saying that the band is exemplary. In short\, a wonderful if little-known LP in desperate need of reissue.	0

The artists are not credited but sound very similar to Collins and Harlan. The label itself states Britannic Record and is very colourful. It shows Britannia listening to a horn gramophone\, draped with a Union Jack. Whilst it states "British made" they were not against using an American duet for their recordings. The label advises My merry automobile but the introduction states Oldsmobile.	0

I'm pullin' through and it's because of you You made me see how lovely life could be Lifted up my heart and made me count the costs To find I'd gained\, not lost.  When I thought that hope was really gone You showed me I was wrong And you taught me how to carry on Thanks for the lift in time and thanks for this song.  I'm pulling through and it's because of you I'd do the same for you if your turn came Hope it never will for I've been through the mill I won't forget this debt\, I'm pulling through.	0

COL title VAL That's the Way Love Goes COL performer VAL Lefty Frizzell	COL video title VAL Johnnie Ray - When It's Springtime In The Rockies (Original Mono 45) COL channel name VAL theflipsidedkid COL description VAL Here's Johnnie Ray\, with a song that did nothing in the US or UK\, but was a big hit here in Australia....and\, it's a magnificent recording of a classic song.  It was released in Australia in late 1959\, and was actually the flipside of a Coronet 45\, KS-363. The A. side was "Wagon Wheels"\, which I've also uploaded to YouTube. Both tracks were lifted from Johnnie's country flavoured LP\, "On The Trail".  This flipside charted in Brisbane (# 5)\, Sydney (#13)\, Melbourne (# 3) and Adelaide (# 3).  It's interesting that the orchestra was conducted by Boudleaux Bryant\, who is better known for his stellar country & pop songwriting partnership with his wife\, Felice.  This upload is from the original Aussie mono 45.  *** If you like my channel\, why not SUBSCRIBE?

COL title VAL Hey\, Hey\, My\, My (Into the Black) COL performer VAL Ultrasound [1]	COL video title VAL Al Hirt: Up Above My Head COL channel name VAL davidhertzberg1 COL description VAL From the LP "Sugar Lips\," issued in 1964 by RCA (LPM-2965\, monaural).  Al Hirt (1922-1999)\, trumpet\, with chorus and orchestra.  Recorded in RCA Victor's "Nashville Sound" Studio\, Nashville\, Tennessee.  Produced by Chet Atkins; recording engineer\, Chuck Seitz.  ----------------------------------------------------------- Al Hirt wurde als Sohn eines Polizeibeamten geboren; er war unter dem Namen ‚ÄûAl" oder ‚ÄûJumbo" bekannt. Im Alter von sechs Jahren begann er Trompete zu spielen und mit 16 war er beruflich Trompeter. Im Jahr 1940 ging er nach Cincinnati\, um am dortigen Musikkonservatorium  zu studieren.  Nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg spielte er in mehreren Swing-Big-Bands. W√§hrend der 1960er-Jahre galt Hirt neben Herb Alpert als einer der popul√§rsten Trompeter; er wurde ausgew√§hlt\, die Titelmusik zu der in den 1960er-Jahren laufenden TV-Show The Green Hornet einzuspielen. Dieses St√ºck wurde von Billy May arrangiert\, wobei das Thema auf Nikolai Rimski-Korsakows ‚ÄûHummelflug" basiert\, und bewies Hirts technische Raffinesse. Das St√ºck erlangte wieder an Popularit√§t\, als es 2003 bei Quentin Tarantinos Film Kill Bill Teil des Soundtracks wurde. In New Orleans f√ºhrte er einige Jahre einen eigenen Club.  Hirt starb im Jahr 1999 an Leberversagen\, nachdem er einige Jahre aufgrund eines √ñdems im Rollstuhl verbracht hatte. ----------------------------------------------------------- Al Hirt - ameryka≈Ñski trƒôbacz jazzowy i kierownik zespo≈Çu muzycznego.  Studiowa≈Ç w konserwatorium w Cincinnati. Wystƒôpowa≈Ç jako pierwszy trƒôbacz w zespo≈Çach Tommy Dorseya\, Jimmy'ego Dorseya\, Raya McKinleya.

Najpopularniejsze nagrania: "Java"\, "Fancy Plants"\, "Just Because"\, "Personality"\, "Panama"\, "Jazz Mr. Blues"\, "Sugar Lips". ----------------------------------------------------------- Al Hirt √©tait le fils d'un officier de police. √Ä l'√¢ge de 6 ans\, il re√ßoit sa premi√®re trompette. Il joue dans le Junior Police Band avec les enfants d'Alcide Yellow Nunez et √† 16 ans\, Hirt joue en tant que professionnel\, souvent avec son ami Pete Fountain. Il est engag√© par un hippodrome voisin pour y jouer.  En 1940\, Hirt se d√©place √† Cincinnati dans l'Ohio pour √©tudier au Cincinnati Conservatory of Music aupr√®s du Dr. Frank Simon (un ancien soliste de l'orchestre de John Philip Sousa). Durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale\, Hirt joue du clairon dans l'arm√©e am√©ricaine\, puis il joue aux c√¥t√©s de plusieurs big bands de swing dont ceux de Tommy Dorsey\, Jimmy Dorsey\, Benny Goodman\, et Ina Rae Hutton. En 1950\, il devient le trompettiste principal de l'orchestre d'Horace Heidt.  Il retourne ensuite √† la Nouvelle-Orl√©ans o√π il aide et m√®ne plusieurs groupes de Dixieland. Malgr√© les d√©clarations de Hirt plusieurs ann√©es plus tard\, Je ne suis pas un trompettiste de jazz et ne fut jamais un trompettiste de jazz\, il enregistra quelques morceaux o√π il montra sa capacit√© √† jouer ce style durant les ann√©es 1950\, en particulier avec Monk Hazel. Il enregistra √©galement pour le label Southland Records.  La dext√©rit√© de Hirt et son style attira rapidement l'attention des labels nationaux. Hirt avait 22 albums dans les Billboard Pop charts durant les ann√©es 50 et 60. Les albums Honey In The Horn et Cotton Candy √©taient tous deux au sommet des charts des meilleures ventes de disque pour l'ann√©e 1964. La m√™me ann√©e\, Hirt r√©ussit √† atteindre le sommet du classement gr√¢ce au morceau Java.	0

A small boy walked down a city street And hope was in his eyes As he searched the faces of the people he'd meet For one he could recognize  Brother\, where are you? They told me that you came this way Brother\, where are you? They said you came this way  The eyes of the people who passed him by Were cold and hard as stone The poor boy whimpered and began to cry Because he was all alone  Brother\, where are you? They told me that you came this way Brother\, where are you? They said you came this way  Now there are many Who will swear that it's true That brothers are we all Yet it seems there are very few Who will answer a brother's call  Brother\, where are you?

Vocals\, Bass - Spook Guitar - Kecks Sabopharge Drums - Vic 'Fontaine' Greener  Engineer - Kevin Ridley Producer - Kevin Ridley\, Spook And The Ghouls  Recorded at Impulse Studios\, Wallsend.  ------------------------  "Bela Lugosi's Dead" is a gothic rock song written by the band Bauhaus. The song was the band's first single\, released in August 1979\, and is often considered to be the first gothic rock record released. It did not enter the UK pop charts at that time. The b-side features the song "Boys" and some versions also include an early demo recording of what would be their next single\, "Dark Entries". It was released on CD in 1988 and was compiled on the 1998 album\, Crackle - The Best of Bauhaus. The original sleeve art was taken from a still of the film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.  Recording session  "Bela Lugosi's Dead" was recorded during a six-hour session at Beck Studios in Wellingborough on 26 January 1979. Four more songs were recorded ("Boys"\, "Harry"\, "Dark Entries" and the unreleased "Some Faces") but not used; only "Harry" surfaced in 1982 as a single B-side to "Kick In The Eye".  The song "Boys" was re-recorded at Beck Studios in spring 1979.  Use in film and television  The song was featured in the 1983 Tony Scott cult vampire film The Hunger\, with Bauhaus portraying a band in a nightclub\, playing it during the opening credits and introduction. A 7" promotional record featuring an edited version of the song was released to theaters playing the movie.  It was also played throughout the movie Dead Man's Curve/The Curve\, and featured in the French movie\, Sombre. The song is played in the movie Good Luck Chuck as an introduction for when the Goth girl is on screen and it is on the soundtrack.  The song was used as the intro music for the late 1990s Saturday Night Live skit "Goth Talk"\, which had Chris Kattan and Molly Shannon as two goth students. This song was also in an episode in the fifth season of Smallville\, the vampire/Halloween-themed "Thirst". The song was also in an episode of One Tree Hill.  The song was featured in an episode ("Midnight") of the science fiction/horror series Fringe which revolved around a vampire-esque creature.  Comedian and musician Bill Bailey parodied the song on his DVD Cosmic Jam as part of a medley in which he and his band\, the Stan Ellis Experiment performed Cockney Rock style versions of popular songs - this particular segment of the medley included lyrical changes such as "E ad a girl's name".  The song was played almost in its entirety during the horror film The Collector during a scene in which the older daughter was attempting to have sex with her boyfriend before they were both viciously murdered.  The song was played in the opening scene of the Supernatural television series in season 6\, episode 5\, "Live Free or Twi-Hard". The episode is vampire-themed\, poking particular fun at the Twilight movie series and its romanticism of vampires.  The Illuminoids made a mash-up called Lugosi's Mongoloid Loser with Bela Lugosi's Dead by Bauhaus\, Loser by Beck and Mongolid By Devo.  Ethan Gold also covered it.	0
COL title VAL Liverpool Lullaby COL performer VAL Cilla Black	COL video title VAL Brian Cadd - Gimme Gimme Good Lovin' (Original 45) COL channel name VAL theflipsidedkid COL description VAL Most people are likely to remember this song as a 1969 hit for Crazy Elephant... ...or\, if you're from the UK\, you may know it from the version by Don Fardon...or\, by the band "Whichwhat".  The version we have here\, by Aussie guy Brian Cadd\, was recorded as a one-off single in L.A\, when he was in the US\, touring with The Bootleg Band.   It was released in Australia in mid 1975 on a Bootleg 45\, BL-249. It charted in Adelaide (# 37)\, but failed to find much favour anywhere else in Australia.  The flipside is the excellent country/rock track\, "Fire At Shepard's Flat"\, which I've also uploaded to YouTube.

COL title VAL Hello Stranger COL performer VAL Carrie Lucas	COL video title VAL Hello Stranger - The Supremes & The Four Tops COL channel name VAL MotownConnoisseur30 COL description VAL Here is another outstanding cover from the third duet album from The Supremes & The Four Tops entitled "Dynamite" from 1971.  Aside from Barbara Lewis' 1963 original\, I think this version is the best of all the covers ever done of the song. It is musical perfection.  Written by: Barbara Lewis Produced by: Bobby Taylor and Frank Wilson Track recorded: May 3\, 1971 Additional overdubs\, strings and horn sessions recorded in Los Angeles: Dates unknown Levi Stubbs lead vocal recorded: June 5\, 1971 & August 17\, 1971 Four Tops background vocals recorded: June 9\, 1971 Jean Terrell lead vocal recorded: June 10\, 1971 Supremes background vocals recorded: June 24\, 1971  This version is the best song on the entire LP and one of the best duets the groups did together over the three albums. Motown was foolish not to release this as a single. It screams hit and would have been one had Motown promoted it\, but at the time The Supremes and The Four Tops were no longer Motown's top priority. Nonetheless\, it still remains an incredible cover.  ****No copyright infringement intended****	1

Don't sent your kinfolk to give me no talkin' I'll be gone\, like I said.  You'd just say the same old thing That you be sayin' all along\, Just lay there in your bed and keep your mouth shut\, Till I'm gone. Don't give me that old familiar cry and fuss and moan  Understand your man\, I'm tired of your bad-mouthin' Understand your man.  You can give my other suit to the Salvation Army\, And everything else I leave behind I ain't takin' nothin' that'll slow down my travelin' While I'm untanglin' my mind.  I ain't gonna repeat What I said any more While I'm breathin' air that ain't been breathed before\, I'll be just as gone as the wild goose in winter  Then you'll understand your man\, meditate on it Understand your man\, you hear me talking Understand your man.

From Wikipedia\, the free encyclopedia "Understand Your Man" is a 1964 single by Johnny Cash.[1] The single went to number one on the country charts for six weeks.[2] "Understand Your Man" also crossed over to the Top 40\, peaking at number 35.[3]  Cash borrowed parts of the melody from Bob Dylan's "Don't Think Twice\, It's All Right".[4]  "Understand Your Man" was also the last song Cash ever performed in front of an audience. It was the last song in his performance at the Carter Family Fold in Hiltons\, Virginia\, on 5 July 2003. Prior to singing it\, Cash told the audience that at that point he had not performed it live in 25 years. (It was not\, however\, the final song he ever sang as despite failing health he continued to make studio recordings until late August 2003\, shortly before his death.)

It was one of the first songs that Archie Bell & the Drells recorded\, in a session in 1967\, along with a number of songs including "She's My Woman". Soon afterwards Bell was drafted into the U.S. Army and began serving in Vietnam. The song became a hit in Houston\, and was picked up by Atlantic Records for distribution in April 1968. By the summer it topped both the Billboard R&B and pop charts. It also sold a million copies by May 1968\, gaining an R.I.A.A. gold disc. The line in "Tighten Up"\, "we dance just as good as we walk" was a little ironic\, given that Bell had been shot in the leg and was consigned to a military hospital bed at the time.  The introduction features Bell introducing himself as being from Houston\, Texas. According to the Billboard Book of Number One Hits by Fred Bronson\, Bell heard a comment after the Kennedy assassination in Dallas\, that "nothing good ever came out of Texas." Bell wanted his listeners to know "we were from Texas and we were good."  The song described an accompanying dance that the band had invented\, also called the "Tighten Up"; this dance became popular concurrently with the song.  The phenomenal success of the single prompted the band to rush out an album\, despite their incapacitated leader. In 1969 the group recorded their first full album with Gamble and Huff\, I Can't Stop Dancing\, which reached number 28 on the R&B chart.

COL title VAL Disney Girls COL performer VAL Art Garfunkel	COL video title VAL Ray Stevens - Little Egypt COL channel name VAL raystevensbigfan COL description VAL "Little Egypt" is from the album called Gitarzan was Rays' fourth studio album\, released in 1969\, as well as his second for Monument Records. Unlike his previous album\, Even Stevens\, this album is completely in the genres of novelty and comedy.   Although this is a true studio album\, all of the songs are overdubbed with cheering and applauding of an audience to provide the feeling of a live album. Cover versions include three of the Coasters' hits ("Yakety Yak\," "Little Egypt" and "Along Came Jones")\, "Mr. Custer\," and "Alley Oop." The album also contains re-recordings of his two novelty hits\, "Harry the Hairy Ape" and "Ahab the Arab." "Freddie Feelgood (And His Funky Little Five Piece Band)" makes its first appearance on an album but is overdubbed with audience noises for this album.  Aside from "Freddie Feelgood\," two singles were lifted from this album: the title track (which tells a bizarre story about Tarzan and Jane and Cheetah forming a music band) and "Along Came Jones". The album version of the former begins with cheers and applause from an audience while the single version does not.  On July 2\, 1996\, Var√®se Sarabande rereleased this album on CD and included three bonus tracks\, all three of which were singles after the release of this album: "The Streak\," "The Moonlight Special\," and "Bridget the Midget (The Queen of the Blues)."	0

COL channel name VAL CrisVangel1958 COL description VAL I Sold My Heart To The Junkman - The Silhouettes (Ace Records) 1958\, 45 rpm!  A Direct Recording!  This song was released earlier on the Junior label\, same version & same flip-side. Before the group became The Silhouettes they were known as The Gospel Tornadoes when they sang in churches on Sundays. When they sang in nightclubs during the rest of the week they were known as The Thunderbirds.  Kae Williams a local disc jockey (WDAS) and the owner of Junior records named the group after The Rays 1957 hit single on Cameo 117 "Silhouettes". Kae Williams refused to release The Silhouettes version of "For Your Precious Love" which they cut while on the road after hearing Jerry Butler & The Impressions version\, due to his friendship with Abner records executive Ewart Abner.

COL title VAL Four O'Clock Blues COL performer VAL Johnny Dunn's Original Jazz Hounds	COL video title VAL FOUR UNTIL LATE (1937) by Robert Johnson COL channel name VAL wilson mcphert COL description VAL I first heard 'Four Until Late' sung by Eric Clapton on the Fresh Cream album. It was one of the first songs I learned on guitar\, and one I still like doing.  .   Robert Johnson\, of course\, was the author of the song (although clearly influenced by Blind Blake's 'Georgia Bound'- see my video). In 1937\, he travelled to Dallas\, Texas\, for his second and final recording session in a makeshift studio at the Brunswick Record Building\, 508 Park Avenue. He recorded this song on 19 June 1937.   It goes without saying that Johnson was one of the most influential blues singers in history. Wikipedia has a substantial profile on him.   There are only two photos of Johnson that I know of\, and I have used these and others to make a slideshow video.   Comments are welcome.	1

Johnny\, take a dive with your sister in the rain Let her talk about the things you can't explain. To touch is to heal\, to hurt is to steal. If you want to kiss the sky\, better learn how to kneel On your knees\, boy!  She's the wave\, she turns the tide She sees the man inside the child.  It's alright\, it's alright\, it's alright. She moves in mysterious ways. It's alright\, it's alright\, it's alright. She moves in mysterious ways\, yeah\, oh\, ah.  Lift my days\, light up my nights\, oh.  One day you'll look back\, and you'll see Where you were held now by this love. While you could stand there\, You could move on this moment Follow this feeling.  It's alright\, it's alright\, it's alright. She moves in mysterious ways. It's alright\, it's alright\, it's alright. She moves in mysterious ways.  Move you\, spirits move you Move\, spirits 'its move you\, oh yeah. Does it move you? She moves with it. Lift my days\, and light up my nights\, oh.	0

COL title VAL Here Comes Your Man COL performer VAL Pixies	COL video title VAL Clive Bruce - Help me COL channel name VAL keurspel (Leon Rossouw) COL description VAL Clive Bruce is a well-known South African country artist. His stepmother\, Virginia Lee - the "Queen of Song" of the early 1960's - introduced him to the recording studio in the 1960s\, and in 1970 he recorded "Sally Sunshine" which went to No.1 on the then popular LM Radio Top 20\, and to number 11 on the South African Top 20 in 1971. He also did radio adverts and sang harmony for many well-known artists of the time\, and he was the first voice of "Sarel Seemonster" on the popular Afrikaans TV show 'Wielie Walie'.  He did voice copies of international hits for the highly successful Springbok Hits Album series\, and was then offered a contract to record a country album called "Ruby"\, which was released in 1978. When TV came on to the scene he appeared with the band "Timepiece"\, and thereafter was invited to do solo spots on various shows and several New Year Specials.  Around this time he was invited to be a guest on many of Bobby Angel's "Gentle on my Mind" programmes\, and Lance James started playing his songs on "Keep it Country". In 1985 he was approached to present "Sing Country" on TV4. It was broadcast every Sunday night and recorded at the Zillertal Restaurant in Pretoria.  In 1993 he started presenting "REWIND"\, a video request programme on TV1 and in 1996 he recorded his first gold album - "One Last Kiss". He has performed in the Sun City Superbowl several times and still continues to travel and perform all around the country. He stays in Pretoria.  This song is off the album "Ruby"\, released in 1978. It's a cover of a Kris Kristofferson song from 1972.	0

COL title VAL Tiny Bubbles COL performer VAL Don Ho	COL video title VAL Henry Mancini -   Tiny Bubbles COL channel name VAL Socratess2007 COL description VAL "I think there is a song out there to describe just about any situation."‚Äï Criss Jami ‚ñº‚ñº‚ñº  HENRY MANCINI Enrico Nicola "Henry" Mancini was an American composer\, arranger and conductor\, who is best remembered for his film and television scores.  He won a record number of Grammy Awards\, plus a posthumous Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995. His best-known works include the jazz-idiom theme to The Pink Panther film series ("The Pink Panther Theme") and the theme to the Peter Gunn television series.  Mancini had a long collaboration with the film director Blake Edwards and won numerous Academy Awards for the songs in Edwards films\, including "Moon River" from Breakfast at Tiffany's\, "Days of Wine and Roses" and for the score to "Victor Victoria". Entering 1946\, Mancini became a pianist and arranger for the newly re-formed Glenn Miller Orchestra\, led by 'Everyman' Tex Beneke. After World War II\, Mancini broadened his skills in composition\, counterpoint\, harmony and orchestration during studies opening with the composers Ernst Krenek and Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco.  In 1952\, Mancini joined the Universal Pictures music department. During the next six years\, he contributed music to over 100 movies\, most notably The Creature from the Black Lagoon\, It Came from Outer Space\, Tarantula\, This Island Earth\, The Glenn Miller Story (for which he received his first Academy Award nomination)\, The Benny Goodman Story and Orson Welles' Touch of Evil. During this time\, he also wrote some popular songs. His first hit was a single by Guy Lombardo and His Royal Canadians titled I Won't Let You Out of My Heart. Mancini left Universal to work as an independent composer/arranger in 1958. Soon after\, he scored the television series Peter Gunn for writer/producer Blake Edwards. This was the genesis of a relationship in which Edwards and Mancini collaborated on 30 films over 35 years.  Along with Alex North\, Elmer Bernstein\, Leith Stevens and Johnny Mandel\, Henry Mancini was a pioneer of the inclusion of jazz elements in the late romantic orchestral film and TV scoring prevalent at the time. Mancini scored many TV movies\, including The Thorn Birds and The Shadow Box. He wrote many television themes\, including Mr. Lucky (starring John Vivyan and Ross Martin)\, NBC Mystery Movie\, What's Happening\, Tic Tac Dough (1990 version) and Once Is Not Enough. In the 1984--85 television season\, four series featured original Mancini themes: Newhart\, Hotel\, Remington Steele\, and Ripley's Believe It or Not. Mancini also composed the "Viewer Mail" theme for Late Night with David Letterman. Mancini composed the theme for NBC Nightly News used beginning in 1975\, and a different theme by him\, titled Salute to the President was used by NBC News for its election coverage (including primaries and conventions) from 1976 to 1992. Salute to the President was only published in a school-band arrangement\, although Mancini performed it frequently with symphony orchestras on his concert tours. Songs with music by Mancini were staples of the easy listening genre from the 1960s to the 1980s. Some of the artists who have recorded Mancini songs include Andy Williams\, Paul Anka\, Pat Boone\, Anita Bryant\, Jack Jones\, Frank Sinatra\, Perry Como\, Connie Francis\, Eydie Gorme\, Steve Lawrence\, Trini Lopez\, George Maharis\, Johnny Mathis\, Jerry Vale and Ray Conniff\, to name just a few.... Mancini recorded over 90 albums\, in styles ranging from big band to light classical to pop. Eight of these albums were certified gold by The Recording Industry Association of America. He had a 20-year contract with RCA Records\, resulting in 60 commercial record albums that made him a household name among artists of easy-listening music.  TINY BUBBLES "Tiny Bubbles" is a song written by Martin Denny and Leon Pober. It was released in 1966 by Don Ho.  It is widely considered to be Denny's most famous song.  MHO "Tiny Bubbles" is -\, with all due respect for Mr Denny\, a rather "simple" song but... hand the notes to a top arranger like Henry Mancini and .... what you get is a fabulous orchestral arrangement that\, in a way\, transforms the song into an easy floating ballad.  A particularly rich instrumentation with strings\, brass\, and all the other "standard" instruments of a large orchestra\, completed with the sound of the ukelele and harp\, so typical for the Hawaiian style music.  The Mancini chorus adds some warmth and "body" to the recording\, so\, in the end\, we get to hear a splendid version of this well known theme.   Have a great (musical) trip to "Aloha country" :) !  Enjoy.	1

The artists are not credited but sound very similar to Collins and Harlan. The label itself states Britannic Record and is very colourful.

COL title VAL Beautiful Sunday COL performer VAL Daniel Boone	COL video title VAL Red Foley Hang Your Head In Shame COL channel name VAL Marcus Brazil COL description VAL Foley was an inspiration to rock 'n' roll\, in particular Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley\, who both covered many of his songs. His country boogie material was a clear precursor of the style.  Foley has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: one for his recording career at\, 6225 Hollywood Blvd. and one for his television career\, at 6300 Hollywood Blvd. On June 10\, 2003\, a Kentucky State historical marker (No. 2114) was placed at Foley's boyhood home in Berea.  In 2002\, he was inducted into the Kentucky Music Hall of Fame\, where his corncob pipe is on display. In 2006\, his 1951 version of "Peace in the Valley" was entered into the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry.  In 1970\, Berea College established the Red Foley Memorial Music Award. Initiated by his long-time friend and colleague Si Siman\, the annual award is presented to talented Berea College students in recognition of their musical contributions to the campus community. It is intended to promote the music associated with Foley‚Äôs career\, such as folk\, country\, bluegrass\, gospel and popular music.  A dance to Foley's song\, "The Salty Dog Rag"\, has been traditional at Dartmouth College since 1972\, where it is taught to freshman during orientation.[21][22] Cumberland Falls State Park\, in Corbin\, Kentucky\, near Foley's hometown of Berea\, has been playing the song with an accompanying dance at its square dance nights since at least the mid-1970s.  The Rooks Van Dellen Residence Hall at Calvin College has an annual celebration of Red Foley Day in mid-November. The celebration began in 1968 when a few students from the hall heard a radio announcer say\, "Red Foley was a great country music singer\, too bad no one will ever remember him." The day has been celebrated (with a few lapses) to remember Foley ever since.[23][24]  Foley Middle School\, located in Berea near Foley's boyhood home\, opened in 1978 and educates students in southern Madison County in the 6th\, 7th\, and 8th grades. The school retains a large collection of personal items once owned by Foley on display in the library. The collection was donated by members of his family.  Red Foley Court is among several streets in Nixa\, Missouri named for performers on Ozark Jubilee\, and Red Foley Road is in Rockcastle County\, Kentucky\, north of Renfro Valley.[25]  In 2009\, singer/songwriter James Power released a song based on Foley's second wife\, Eva Overstake (aka Judy Martin)\, entitled "A Cowgirl's Suicide" on YouTube.[26] The song was featured in the independent film Laid Off by director John Launchi.	0

COL description VAL 1958 wurde die Band in London unter dem Namen The Drifters als Begleitband f√ºr Cliff Richard gegr√ºndet. Auf Druck der amerikanischen Band gleichen Namens benannten sie sich 1959 in The Shadows um. Den Vorschlag hierzu machte Jet Harris bei einer Runde ‚ÄûAle and Lime" in der ‚Äû2i's Coffee Bar"\, nachdem die vier Musiker stets im ‚ÄûSchatten" von Cliff Richard gestanden hatten[1].

COL title VAL Cissy Strut COL performer VAL Earl Van Dyke	COL video title VAL Red Foley Hang Your Head In Shame COL channel name VAL Marcus Brazil COL description VAL Foley was an inspiration to rock 'n' roll\, in particular Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley\, who both covered many of his songs. His country boogie material was a clear precursor of the style.  Foley has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: one for his recording career at\, 6225 Hollywood Blvd. and one for his television career\, at 6300 Hollywood Blvd. On June 10\, 2003\, a Kentucky State historical marker (No. 2114) was placed at Foley's boyhood home in Berea.  In 2002\, he was inducted into the Kentucky Music Hall of Fame\, where his corncob pipe is on display. In 2006\, his 1951 version of "Peace in the Valley" was entered into the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry.  In 1970\, Berea College established the Red Foley Memorial Music Award. Initiated by his long-time friend and colleague Si Siman\, the annual award is presented to talented Berea College students in recognition of their musical contributions to the campus community. It is intended to promote the music associated with Foley‚Äôs career\, such as folk\, country\, bluegrass\, gospel and popular music.  A dance to Foley's song\, "The Salty Dog Rag"\, has been traditional at Dartmouth College since 1972\, where it is taught to freshman during orientation.[21][22] Cumberland Falls State Park\, in Corbin\, Kentucky\, near Foley's hometown of Berea\, has been playing the song with an accompanying dance at its square dance nights since at least the mid-1970s.  The Rooks Van Dellen Residence Hall at Calvin College has an annual celebration of Red Foley Day in mid-November. The celebration began in 1968 when a few students from the hall heard a radio announcer say\, "Red Foley was a great country music singer\, too bad no one will ever remember him." The day has been celebrated (with a few lapses) to remember Foley ever since.[23][24]  Foley Middle School\, located in Berea near Foley's boyhood home\, opened in 1978 and educates students in southern Madison County in the 6th\, 7th\, and 8th grades. The school retains a large collection of personal items once owned by Foley on display in the library. The collection was donated by members of his family.  Red Foley Court is among several streets in Nixa\, Missouri named for performers on Ozark Jubilee\, and Red Foley Road is in Rockcastle County\, Kentucky\, north of Renfro Valley.[25]  In 2009\, singer/songwriter James Power released a song based on Foley's second wife\, Eva Overstake (aka Judy Martin)\, entitled "A Cowgirl's Suicide" on YouTube.[26] The song was featured in the independent film Laid Off by director John Launchi.	0

His stepmother\, Virginia Lee - the "Queen of Song" of the early 1960's - introduced him to the recording studio in the 1960s\, and in 1970 he recorded "Sally Sunshine" which went to No.1 on the then popular LM Radio Top 20\, and to number 11 on the South African Top 20 in 1971.

He did voice copies of international hits for the highly successful Springbok Hits Album series\, and was then offered a contract to record a country album called "Ruby"\, which was released in 1978. When TV came on to the scene he appeared with the band "Timepiece"\, and thereafter was invited to do solo spots on various shows and several New Year Specials.  Around this time he was invited to be a guest on many of Bobby Angel's "Gentle on my Mind" programmes\, and Lance James started playing his songs on "Keep it Country".

He has performed in the Sun City Superbowl several times and still continues to travel and perform all around the country. He stays in Pretoria.  This song is off the album "Ruby"\, released in 1978.

She moves in mysterious ways. It's alright\, it's alright\, it's alright. She moves in mysterious ways\, yeah\, oh\, ah.  Lift my days\, light up my nights\, oh.

COL title VAL Hello Stranger COL performer VAL The New York Rubber Rock Band	COL video title VAL YVONNE ELLIMAN Hello Stranger COL channel name VAL daveinprogress3 COL description VAL Hawaiian beauty\, Yvonne Elliman\, was not on the pop landscape all that long\, but she made her impact\, and her gorgeous face and sweet but powerful vocals graced the 1970's with a distinctive air. I am posting "Hello Stranger"\, as it is not one of her bigger chart successes\, but it does showcase her wonderful voice and it is a very seventies take on the 60's Barbara Lewis classic.  35 years ago\, "Love me"\, written by the Bee Gees\, was a breakout hit for Yvonne\, giving her a worldwide hit\, including Australia\, where it would ascend the charts and reach #4 in the late summer of 1977. "Hello Stranger" was discovered by me\, once again courtesy of a Various Artist compile - the sexy styled "Ripper 77" with the curvaceous cheeks of a woman adorned with lipstick writing of the names of the 20 original artists featured on the record.  "Hello Stranger"\, like several of the hits on this compile\, was not a hit in Australia\, but three and a half decades later\, it is a fondly considered musical postcard from the era\, and i am eternally grateful to the record companies for releasing those compilations\, even if some of the inclusions were bizarre and obscure.  Back in the halcyon days of the late 1970's\, radio airplay and tv shows like "Countdown" and "Sounds Unlimited" were the few outlets for songs to receive exposure. So many fine recordings were simply overlooked\, because of the few opportunities for visibility or audibility at the time.   1978 would be the major year for Yvonne with another Gibb brothers extravaganza giving her the biggest success of her career with the #1 smash "If I can't have you"\, from  the pop & disco juggernaut "Saturday Night Fever". Another movie soundtrack "Moment by Moment" also starring John Travolta\, would see another recording by Yvonne Elliman - the title track\, but the gentle ballad could not break through the endless litany of disco hits that monopolised 1979. Her own "Love Pains" was her final hit from that part of her career\, and it is a much loved and much covered anthem from the disco era.  I hope "Hello Stranger" gives whoever hears it\, the joy that it has given me.	1

COL title VAL About a Quarter to Nine COL performer VAL Al Jolson	COL video title VAL Johnny Mathis ~ Southern Nights COL channel name VAL lenoremewton COL description VAL This upload is in honor of Johnny's recent Grammy nomination for his latest CD: "Let It Be Me: Mathis in Nashville". I love many songs on this CD - this is one of my favorites. Love Johnny's wonderful\, contagious energy  (catch that sweet 'yeehaw' moment - s'cuze me - that's what comes when I hear it! -  at about 2:35 - and that's him in those cool\, cute sneaks movin' in Cohasset this summer)\,  and the beautiful symphonic blend of his interpretation with the incredible musicians accompanying him. In researching the song I watched several videos of Jerry Douglas (Dobro)\, Bryan Sutton (Acoustic Guitar\, Banjo\, Mandolin)\, Stuart Duncan (Fiddle\, Mandolin) and others\, all like Johnny\, gifted\, and according to executive producer Jay Lander's liner notes\,  'handpicked group of Nashville's finest" by producer Fred Molin.  If you don't own it- well worth it- and the notes\, so descriptive of each song's history. And one can't improve on Lander's further notes: "Johnny Mathis draws the listener into his world like a master storyteller.....the emotions\, in Johnny's hands\, nothing less than profound." You are not listening to a set of songs put to voice and music here. If you do what country music\, I believe 'invites' you to do\,  slow down\, listen\, take in the sounds\, the meaning\, the simplicity\, the emotions and joy\, you'll hear these stories with every nuance available. Enjoy!  And I defy your feet or body to stay still listening to this rich number! And here's to Johnny\, once again\, the consummate re-inventor of his own style\,and yet always just a step away from the 'magic' core we all love.   The song\, composed by Allen Toussaint\, was released in 1977 by Glenn Campbell and hit #1 as a 'cross over' number that year in Country\, Pop and Adult Contemporary.	0

Following their footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors\, Of silent desperation\, never speaking to a soul. The poison air he's breathing has the dirty smell of dying\, 'Cos it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain. But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes\, Of the clicking of the turnstiles and the rattle of his chains.  "Oh\," she said: "Casey\, it's been so long since I've seen you. "Here\," she said: "just a kiss to make a body smile. "See\," she said: "I've put on new stockings just to please you. "Lord\," she said. "Casey\, can you only stay a while."  Casey leaves the underground and stops inside The Golden Crown\, For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bones. Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men\, Who reach for anything they can to keep from going home. Standing in the corner\, Casey drinks his pint of bitter\, Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by. Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason\, Is the beer that's in his belly or the tear that's in his eye.  "Oh\," she said: "I suppose you seldom think about me. "Now\," she said: "now that you've a family of your own. "Still\," she said: "It's so blessed good to feel your body. "Lord\," she said: "Casey\, it's a shame to be alone."	0

COL title VAL I Won't Cry Anymore COL performer VAL Charles Brown	COL video title VAL Brian Cadd - Gimme Gimme Good Lovin' (Original 45) COL channel name VAL theflipsidedkid COL description VAL Most people are likely to remember this song as a 1969 hit for Crazy Elephant... ...or\, if you're from the UK\, you may know it from the version by Don Fardon...or\, by the band "Whichwhat".  The version we have here\, by Aussie guy Brian Cadd\, was recorded as a one-off single in L.A\, when he was in the US\, touring with The Bootleg Band.   It was released in Australia in mid 1975 on a Bootleg 45\, BL-249. It charted in Adelaide (# 37)\, but failed to find much favour anywhere else in Australia.  The flipside is the excellent country/rock track\, "Fire At Shepard's Flat"\, which I've also uploaded to YouTube.  This upload is from the original 45.  *** If you like my channel\, why not SUBSCRIBE?

COL title VAL Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again COL performer VAL Sarah Brightman	COL video title VAL Cornelis Vreeswijk - Epistel 81 COL channel name VAL Tjerk T. COL description VAL Cornelis Vreeswijk - Epistel 81  Mijn favoriete troubadour uit de 70-er jaren: Cornelis Vreeswijk werd in 1937 in IJmuiden geboren als oudste van vier kinderen. In 1948\, Cornelis was toen elf jaar oud\, verhuisde het gezin naar Stockholm in Zweden waar zijn vader\, Jacob Cornelis Vreeswijk\, nadat hij in Nederland een taxi- en garagebedrijf had gehad\, ging werken als automonteur. Het gezin remigreerde in 1961 naar Nederland\, maar Cornelis en zijn zuster Ida bleven in Zweden wonen.  Vreeswijk debuteerde in 1964 met Ballader och of√∂rsk√§mdheter (Ballades en onbeschaamdheden). Zijn grote doorbraak kwam in 1968 met Tio vackra visor och personliga Person (Tien mooie liederen en 'persoonlijke Person'\, een woordspeling op een Zweedse achternaam). Hij nam ook liederen op van Carl Michael Bellman (1740-1795\, een Zweeds dichter) en Evert Taube (1890 - 1976)\, zijn directe voorganger als belangrijkste Zweedse troubadour.  Ook na zijn dood bleef Vreeswijks oeuvre in Zweden ongekend populair\, getuige ook de nationale Cornelis Vreeswijkdag aldaar.  Vreeswijk werd in 1966 door de VARA uitgenodigd naar Nederland te komen. Een single van De nozem en de non flopte. Zes jaar later verscheen zijn elpee Cornelis Vreeswijk (1972) die bekroond werd met platina; er werden honderdduizend exemplaren van verkocht. Zijn volgende Nederlandstalige platen hadden echter maar weinig succes.  In 1973 verscheen zijn LP I st√§llet f√∂r vykort (In plaats van ansichtkaarten)\, waarop hij stelling nam tegen de oorlog in Vietnam. Teksten van Victor Jara werden door hem in 1978 op de plaat gezet.  In 1974 reikte Prins Adrianus I van carnavalsvereniging de Pintenwippers uit IJmuiden aan Vreeswijk het grootkruis der Pintenwippers uit.  In 1985 werd bij Vreeswijk leverkanker geconstateerd. Hij stierf twee jaar later op 50-jarige leeftijd	0

Song information  Written by Debbie Harry and Nigel Harrison for the band's third studio album\, Parallel Lines (1978)\, the song was inspired by one of Harry's ex-boyfriends who stalked her after their break up.  The song was released as a single in the US as the follow-up to "Heart of Glass". "One Way or Another" reached number twenty-four in the Billboard Hot 100. Although never officially released as a single in the United Kingdom and other countries\, the song remains one of the group's most popular songs worldwide. Rolling Stone ranked the song #298 on its list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.  The song was included on the US and Canadian versions of the band's first hits compilation\, The Best of Blondie (1981)\, but not on international releases. The artist of the song loves to eat shells\,blondes\, and windows.  Blondie released a manipulated live version of the song (with the audience noise removed) as the theme for the 1999 US television series Snoops. This version was released in the US as a bonus track on the US Live version of their album Livid (Live). The original un-edited live version was included on the European / non-US Livid version.  The song is featured in the films: Little Darlings (1980)\, Carpool (1996)\, Beverly Hills Ninja (1997)\, Donnie Brasco (1997)\, Coyote Ugly (2000) and Mean Girls (2004)\, as well as the television series Veronica Mars. It also plays in the end credits of the film Seed of Chucky. It is also heard in the opening moments of The A-Team episode\, "Incident at Crystal Lake".  The song is the title track for Channel 4's drama "Sugar Rush" set in Brighton that was broadcast from 2005-2006.  The song is a playable track on Rock Band 2\, Guitar Hero World Tour and Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades. The song is also featured in Driver: Parallel Lines.  This song is also featured in several 2004 Swiffer commercials.  UK singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor did a cover version for The Guru movie soundtrack in 2001.  Actress Kristen Bell did a karaoke version of this song in one episode of the TV series Veronica Mars.  Singer Mandy Moore recorded a cover for the film "Aquamarine" (2006). The song was also covered in 1998 by actress Melissa Joan Hart for an episode of her TV series\, Sabrina\, the Teenage Witch. It was released later that year on the show's soundtrack album.  In The Rugrats Movie Angelica sings her own version of the song with different lyrics (written by Eryk Casemiro)\, the soundtrack album includes a longer version of the song not heard in the movie.  Rapper G-Dep interpolates this song on his song called "One Way" on his album\, Child of the Ghetto.  Jada will perform that song from their new studio album.  Play will perform that song from their new studio album Under My Skin.  Cover versions  Full Blown Rose Sophie Ellis Bextor In The Flesh Mandy Moore The Rock Legs.	0

She Drives Me Crazy (Written-By - Fine Young Cannibals)  ------------------------  She Drives Me Crazy" is a song recorded by the Fine Young Cannibals\, included on their 1989 album The Raw and the Cooked. The song peaked at #5 as a single in the band's native UK in January 1989 (it was released on New Year's Day) before hitting #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S. on 15 April 1989. It appeared on The Raw and Cooked album the following month.  It also made number 3 on the Dutch Top 40. A remixed version was released in 1997.  The unique snare drum "pop" sound was created by recording the snare drum portion separately. A speaker was then placed on top of the snare drum\, and a microphone below. The original recording of the snare drum part was played back through the speaker and re-recorded.  Music video  Two music videos were produced for the song\, one by Philippe Decoufl√© and one by Pedro Romhanyi. Similar to Decoufl√©'s only other music video\, New Order's "True Faith"\, his version includes extensive choreography and performers in unusual costumes\, including two identical dancers with completely different coloured-outfits\, as well as a person with a television on their head. This version received several nominations at the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards\, including Best Video.	0

The original line-up consisted of Brian le Gassick ‚Äì lead vocals\, guitar\, John Leach ‚Äì lead guitar\, Willie van der Walt ‚Äì bass and Ian Miller ‚Äì drums. In 1962 Leach and van der Walt were replaced by Richard Crouse ‚Äì guitar\, Jimmy Routledge ‚Äì bass and Billy Andrews ‚Äì vocals\, harmonica (Billy later became one half of the duo the ‚ÄúDream Merchants‚Äù with Billy Forrest). In 1964 the Staccatos won the Transvaal Merseyside Contest\, which included a recording contract with EMI. They supported Peter and Gordon on their tour of South Africa in 1965.

I've only added the footage as a tribute for historical\, entertainment\, and creative purposes with no financial gain. Copyright infringement not intended.  The Four Tunes "I Sold My Heart To The Junkman" Jubilee 5174 A 1954  Here are The Four Tunes with their version of "I Sold My Heart To The Junkman." This is the 2nd pressing that was released in 1954 by Jubilee\, in the same year as the 1st pressing. A nice\, minty\, clean 78 for your enjoyment.  The 4 Tunes were probably the leading black Pop vocal group during the 1950s. Their origins can be traced back to a change of personnel in the Ink Spots. This requires a brief review of some events in the mid-40s. In June 1944\, during an engagement in Chicago\, Hoppy Jones became ill and the group had to finish a tour without him (Deek Watson filled in on the mandatory talking parts). This had unsuspected ramifications. Hoppy was the conciliatory father figure (nicknamed "the grand old man") of the Ink Spots. Now that he was missing\, infighting between Bill Kenny and Deek Watson\, which had formerly just smoldered\, now flared up unchecked. Deek had been the leader of the group until their 1939 smash of "If I Didn't Care." Since then\, Bill had firmly established himself in the forefront of the Ink Spots\, pushing Deek further and further into the background. Hoppy returned in August\, but by then\, the damage had been done.  When he announced (in the January 1945 settlement of the lawsuits) that he would form a new group based "on a completely new idea\," he simply changed their name to the "Brown Dots" (the name does sound somewhat familiar\, doesn't it?). As it turned out\, the "new idea" was to sound as much like the Ink Spots as possible. One real difference was that the Brown Dots relied more on harmony than the Ink Spots\, who were more individualists. (Since the Brown Dots were also managed by Moe Gale\, we know who the hands-down winner in this contest was.)  The polished style of the 4 Tunes was the product of their training\, experience\, dedication\, and discipline. Their songs were carefully selected and arranged. Their first arranger was pianist Ralph Herman\, who was the youngest member of Paul Whiteman's Orchestra. They also worked with Howard Biggs (whose most famous association was with the Ravens).  In mid-1953\, they once again changed labels (since they weren't making any royalties from RCA). This time they went to Jerry Blaine's Jubilee label\, where they achieved their greatest popularity. Their first Jubilee recording\, "Marie\," was released in September\, and reached #2 on the R&B charts (#13 Pop). This Irving Berlin tune had been a #1 smash for Tommy Dorsey (Jack Leonard on vocal) back in 1937. ("Marie" was such a big hit that the purely R&B Dominoes and Larks were pushed to sing in the same kind of Pop mold.) Their next Jubilee release\, "I Understand Just How You Feel" was an even bigger hit\, climbing to #6 on the Pop charts (#7 R&B).  1954 saw two releases on the Kay-Ron label. These were old Manor cuts (although different takes). Two of them were backups to Savannah Churchill ("Savannah Sings The Blues" and "I Want To Be Loved"). The other two were "Just In Case You Change Your Mind" (which was actually by the Brown Dots) and "I Understand" (which was presumably released to confuse record buyers into thinking it was the same song as the current "I Understand Just How You Feel").  On Jubilee\, the 4 Tunes were primarily a Pop group (although they did turn out something called "Rock N Roll Call"). Their output included "Don't Cry Darling\," "L'amour\, Toujours L'amour\," "I Sold My Heart To The Junkman\," "Time Out For Tears\," "You Are My Love\," "Far Away Places\," "Dancing With Tears In My Eyes\," "Sayonara\," and "A Little On The Lonely Side."  The 4 Tunes appeared for a week at the Apollo Theater (beginning April 2\, 1955)\, along with Red Prysock's Orchestra. They played both the black theater circuit and also many white clubs. When they were on a tour with Joni James\, she asked Jimmie Nabbie to write a song for her. The result\, "You Are My Love\," was her big hit of 1955 (which the 4 Tunes covered).  In 1955\, the 4 Tunes were booked into the Hacienda in Las Vegas on a handshake\, and stayed for eight years. Other members\, added at the time\, were Smiley Hightower (guitar and bassist) and Eddie Williams (bassist; formerly of Johnny Moore's Three Blazers). Also\, tenor Billy Wells (from Deek's second Brown Dots group) was hired so that each of the other members could go on vacation on a rotating basis.

It was one of the first songs I learned on guitar\, and one I still like doing.  .   Robert Johnson\, of course\, was the author of the song (although clearly influenced by Blind Blake's 'Georgia Bound'- see my video). In 1937\, he travelled to Dallas\, Texas\, for his second and final recording session in a makeshift studio at the Brunswick Record Building\, 508 Park Avenue. He recorded this song on 19 June 1937.   It goes without saying that Johnson was one of the most influential blues singers in history. Wikipedia has a substantial profile on him.   There are only two photos of Johnson that I know of\, and I have used these and others to make a slideshow video.   Comments are welcome.	0

"On My Way to You"\, released on the 1993 CD "How Do You Keep the Music Playing"\, is expressed with delicate sensitivity and a rich blending of these incredible four emissaries of song: the Bergman's poetic lyrics\, Michel Legrand's passionate composition and arrangement - all brought to life through Johnny's empathic\, intimate and deep interpretation of love's journey. To quote the Bergman's (liner notes) : "(Johnny) makes all within the sound of it feel as though he is singing just to them...... And it's a voice that keeps getting better- wiser\, more knowing\, more moving".  Only to repeat myself- this CD is such a treasure to own- each song inviting you to a place of 'dream-like' memory.

COL title VAL Bad Blood COL performer VAL Scott Bradlee's Postmodern Jukebox ft. Aubrey Logan	COL video title VAL Archie Bell & The Drells - Tighten up (1968) COL channel name VAL Moraito COL description VAL "Tighten Up" was a 1968 song by Houston\, Texas based R&B vocal group Archie Bell & the Drells. It reached #1 on both the Billboard R&B and pop charts in the spring of 1968. It is ranked #265 on the Rolling Stone magazine's list of "the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time" and is one of the earliest funk hits in music history. "Tighten Up" was written by Archie Bell and Billy Buttier. It was one of the first songs that Archie Bell & the Drells recorded\, in a session in 1967\, along with a number of songs including "She's My Woman". Soon afterwards Bell was drafted into the U.S. Army and began serving in Vietnam. The song became a hit in Houston\, and was picked up by Atlantic Records for distribution in April 1968. By the summer it topped both the Billboard R&B and pop charts. It also sold a million copies by May 1968\, gaining an R.I.A.A. gold disc. The line in "Tighten Up"\, "we dance just as good as we walk" was a little ironic\, given that Bell had been shot in the leg and was consigned to a military hospital bed at the time.  The introduction features Bell introducing himself as being from Houston\, Texas. According to the Billboard Book of Number One Hits by Fred Bronson\, Bell heard a comment after the Kennedy assassination in Dallas\, that "nothing good ever came out of Texas." Bell wanted his listeners to know "we were from Texas and we were good."  The song described an accompanying dance that the band had invented\, also called the "Tighten Up"; this dance became popular concurrently with the song.  The phenomenal success of the single prompted the band to rush out an album\, despite their incapacitated leader. In 1969 the group recorded their first full album with Gamble and Huff\, I Can't Stop Dancing\, which reached number 28 on the R&B chart.

Jack Henderson Clement (April 5\, 1931 ‚Äì August 8\, 2013) was an American singer\, songwriter\, and a record and film producer.  In 1957\, Clement wrote the song "Ballad of a Teenage Queen" that became a crossover hit for Johnny Cash. Other Cash hits written by Clement included "Guess Things Happen That Way"\, which was # 1 country and # 11 pop in 1958\, and the humorous "The One on the Right Is on the Left"\, which was a # 2 country and # 46 pop hit in 1966. He produced Cash's # 1 hit "Ring of Fire" in 1963. Clement performed "Guess Things Happen That Way" on the Johnny Cash Memorial Tribute show on CMT in November 2003.  Jack was raised and educated in Memphis\, TN.  He was Nicknamed 'Cowboy' Jack Clement\, during his student days. He played steel guitar with a local band\, and in 1956 became part of one of the seminal events in rock and roll history when he went to work as a producer and engineer for Sam Phillips at Sun Records. There\, Clement worked with future stars such as Roy Orbison\, Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash. But most importantly\, he discovered and recorded Jerry Lee Lewis while Sam Phillips was away on a trip to Florida (one of those recordings\, "Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On"	0
COL title VAL Another Brick in the Wall\, Part 1 COL performer VAL Luther Wright & The Wrongs	COL video title VAL Archie Bell & The Drells - Tighten up (1968) COL channel name VAL Moraito COL description VAL "Tighten Up" was a 1968 song by Houston\, Texas based R&B vocal group Archie Bell & the Drells. It reached #1 on both the Billboard R&B and pop charts in the spring of 1968. It is ranked #265 on the Rolling Stone magazine's list of "the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time" and is one of the earliest funk hits in music history. "Tighten Up" was written by Archie Bell and Billy Buttier. It was one of the first songs that Archie Bell & the Drells recorded\, in a session in 1967\, along with a number of songs including "She's My Woman". Soon afterwards Bell was drafted into the U.S. Army and began serving in Vietnam. The song became a hit in Houston\, and was picked up by Atlantic Records for distribution in April 1968. By the summer it topped both the Billboard R&B and pop charts. It also sold a million copies by May 1968\, gaining an R.I.A.A. gold disc. The line in "Tighten Up"\, "we dance just as good as we walk" was a little ironic\, given that Bell had been shot in the leg and was consigned to a military hospital bed at the time.  The introduction features Bell introducing himself as being from Houston\, Texas. According to the Billboard Book of Number One Hits by Fred Bronson\, Bell heard a comment after the Kennedy assassination in Dallas\, that "nothing good ever came out of Texas." Bell wanted his listeners to know "we were from Texas and we were good."  The song described an accompanying dance that the band had invented\, also called the "Tighten Up"; this dance became popular concurrently with the song.  The phenomenal success of the single prompted the band to rush out an album\, despite their incapacitated leader. In 1969 the group recorded their first full album with Gamble and Huff\, I Can't Stop Dancing\, which reached number 28 on the R&B chart.

I've only added the footage as a tribute for historical\, entertainment\, and creative purposes with no financial gain. Copyright infringement not intended.  The Four Tunes "I Sold My Heart To The Junkman" Jubilee 5174 A 1954  Here are The Four Tunes with their version of "I Sold My Heart To The Junkman." This is the 2nd pressing that was released in 1954 by Jubilee\, in the same year as the 1st pressing. A nice\, minty\, clean 78 for your enjoyment.  The 4 Tunes were probably the leading black Pop vocal group during the 1950s. Their origins can be traced back to a change of personnel in the Ink Spots. This requires a brief review of some events in the mid-40s. In June 1944\, during an engagement in Chicago\, Hoppy Jones became ill and the group had to finish a tour without him (Deek Watson filled in on the mandatory talking parts). This had unsuspected ramifications. Hoppy was the conciliatory father figure (nicknamed "the grand old man") of the Ink Spots. Now that he was missing\, infighting between Bill Kenny and Deek Watson\, which had formerly just smoldered\, now flared up unchecked. Deek had been the leader of the group until their 1939 smash of "If I Didn't Care." Since then\, Bill had firmly established himself in the forefront of the Ink Spots\, pushing Deek further and further into the background. Hoppy returned in August\, but by then\, the damage had been done.  When he announced (in the January 1945 settlement of the lawsuits) that he would form a new group based "on a completely new idea\," he simply changed their name to the "Brown Dots" (the name does sound somewhat familiar\, doesn't it?). As it turned out\, the "new idea" was to sound as much like the Ink Spots as possible. One real difference was that the Brown Dots relied more on harmony than the Ink Spots\, who were more individualists. (Since the Brown Dots were also managed by Moe Gale\, we know who the hands-down winner in this contest was.)  The polished style of the 4 Tunes was the product of their training\, experience\, dedication\, and discipline. Their songs were carefully selected and arranged. Their first arranger was pianist Ralph Herman\, who was the youngest member of Paul Whiteman's Orchestra. They also worked with Howard Biggs (whose most famous association was with the Ravens).  In mid-1953\, they once again changed labels (since they weren't making any royalties from RCA). This time they went to Jerry Blaine's Jubilee label\, where they achieved their greatest popularity. Their first Jubilee recording\, "Marie\," was released in September\, and reached #2 on the R&B charts (#13 Pop). This Irving Berlin tune had been a #1 smash for Tommy Dorsey (Jack Leonard on vocal) back in 1937. ("Marie" was such a big hit that the purely R&B Dominoes and Larks were pushed to sing in the same kind of Pop mold.) Their next Jubilee release\, "I Understand Just How You Feel" was an even bigger hit\, climbing to #6 on the Pop charts (#7 R&B).  1954 saw two releases on the Kay-Ron label. These were old Manor cuts (although different takes). Two of them were backups to Savannah Churchill ("Savannah Sings The Blues" and "I Want To Be Loved"). The other two were "Just In Case You Change Your Mind" (which was actually by the Brown Dots) and "I Understand" (which was presumably released to confuse record buyers into thinking it was the same song as the current "I Understand Just How You Feel").  On Jubilee\, the 4 Tunes were primarily a Pop group (although they did turn out something called "Rock N Roll Call"). Their output included "Don't Cry Darling\," "L'amour\, Toujours L'amour\," "I Sold My Heart To The Junkman\," "Time Out For Tears\," "You Are My Love\," "Far Away Places\," "Dancing With Tears In My Eyes\," "Sayonara\," and "A Little On The Lonely Side."  The 4 Tunes appeared for a week at the Apollo Theater (beginning April 2\, 1955)\, along with Red Prysock's Orchestra. They played both the black theater circuit and also many white clubs. When they were on a tour with Joni James\, she asked Jimmie Nabbie to write a song for her. The result\, "You Are My Love\," was her big hit of 1955 (which the 4 Tunes covered).  In 1955\, the 4 Tunes were booked into the Hacienda in Las Vegas on a handshake\, and stayed for eight years. Other members\, added at the time\, were Smiley Hightower (guitar and bassist) and Eddie Williams (bassist; formerly of Johnny Moore's Three Blazers). Also\, tenor Billy Wells (from Deek's second Brown Dots group) was hired so that each of the other members could go on vacation on a rotating basis.

It was released on their debut album A Flock of Seagulls in 1982 and was its most successful single\, reaching number 9 in the United States and number 1 in Australia.  Single  The single was promoted by a distinctive music video in which the band members performed in a room covered in aluminum foil and mirrors. The cameras used to film the video are clearly visible in many of the background reflections\, their stands also covered in foil. The video is a homage to Brian Eno and Robert Fripp's (No Pussyfooting) album cover\, which was also respectively portrayed by The Strokes for their single\, "The End Has No End" two decades later. The video received heavy rotation on MTV in the summer of 1982\, and helped the single to become a hit. The video features a different edit of "I Ran" than the album version; the introduction was greatly shortened.  The band toured the United States extensively to promote the single\, supporting Squeeze on their 1982 tour. As well as reaching #9 on the Billboard Hot 100\, "I Ran" peaked at #3 on the Mainstream Rock chart and #8 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. Subsequently the album reached number 10 on the Billboard 200.  Despite success in the States and Australia\, the single did not enjoy similar success in the band's home country (United Kingdom)\, failing to make the top 40.  In an interview on the VH1 special 100 Greatest Songs of the '80s\, Mike Score said that he resents the song\, but plays it live because people enjoy it. "I Ran" was listed at #55 on the countdown. In VH1's 100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders of the 80s\, the song was listed at #2\, with Mike Score's interview played again.  Although considered an '80s New Wave classic\, the song experienced somewhat of a revival in 2002 as the signature theme for the video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City; being played during the game's television commercials and during gameplay as one of the songs in the playlist for radio station Wave 103.  Along with the Bowling for Soup cover\, it was also used as the theme song for the English dub of the anime series Knights of the Zodiac which was later removed from the air during its first season.  The song briefly featured in the Dead Zone Season 2 episode 'Playing God'\, heard during a party scene. It can also be heard during a nightclub scene in the 2005 Nick Love film The Business.  The master recording is available as a playable song in Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s as well as the rebooted version of Karaoke Revolution. The song was from the TV show Everybody Hates Chris entitled Everybody Hates the Last Day  It was performed by the Ska Rangers in the film The Hangover: Part II during the closing scene.  Also\, Fez sung a verse in That 70's Show during one of the "Circles" in the fourth season's opener.  Cover versions  "I Ran" has been covered by a number of artists:  Tori Amos covered the song on her Original Sinsuality/Summer Of Sin Tour in Denver\, during Piano Bar Time. Her version was released with the rest of the show in the 3rd CD of The Original Bootlegs.  Assemblage 23 recorded the song for the 1997 compilation Newer Wave.  Cranial Screwtop recorded a version of the song for their 2006 album "Too Fast for Technology".  Terminal Choice's cover of the song is included on the bonus disk of their 2006 album New Born Enemies.  Bowling for Soup covered the song for the 2003 re-release of their album Drunk Enough to Dance and their "Punk Rock 101" single. Both the original and the punk cover are the theme song of the American version of Saint Seiya\, also known as Knights of the Zodiac.  Hidden in Plain View recorded the song on the covers compilation album Punk Goes 80s.  In Dance Dance Revolution: Hottest Party 2\, Spacebar vs Naughty G covered this song.  Darude and Blake Lewis released a cover in 2008.  Nickelback covered the song during their Dark Horse Tour in 2010. It was sung by guitarist/vocalist Ryan Peake.  Slim Thug also took the bass line of this song to produce his single "I Run"  Umphrey's Mcgee covered the song during a performance at the Birmingham Southern College on 4/9/05\, however they have played it many times before.  Ska Rangers covered the song which featured on the film and soundtrack of The Hangover: Part II.	0

COL title VAL It's Gonna Take a Miracle COL performer VAL The Royalettes	COL video title VAL Streets of Baltimore - Nanci Griffith and John Prine COL channel name VAL MyMoppet52 COL description VAL from her album\, "Other Voices\, Too - A Trip Back to Bountiful"\, released in 1998. This is Nanci's 15th album and she is joined with other artists. She considers this a follow up to her album\, "Other Voices\, Other Rooms" which was released in 1993. In this album her focus on songwriters is so much a part of the album's spirit. The writers whose songs Nanci has selected range from the well-known\, like British folk-pop artists Richard Thompson and Sandy Denny\, early American rocker Sonny Curtis\, American folksingers Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger and country legend Johnny Cash\, to lesser known writers like John Grimaudo\, Saylor White\, Ian Tyson and Texas songwriter Mickie Merkens\, to Stephen Foster\, perhaps the greatest American songwriter of the 19th century. "We started with several songs that spilled over from the last album\, like Richard Thompson's 'Wall Of Death' and Stephen Foster's 'Hard Times Come Again No More\,' then we went back to the list of songs I felt weren't sung enough".  At times\, we had so many people in the studio -- like when we had 37 for "Wasn't That A Mighty Storm" -- and they wouldn't leave! The beer was free\, the food was good\, everyone got to meet their heroes. It was just so exciting to bring people together.  quotes from Nanci Griffith found on the site homepages.sover.net/~rschrull/ngriffith/othertoo/othertoo.html  I do not own this song.

COL title VAL Ain't That Loving You Baby COL performer VAL The Beau Brummels	COL video title VAL The Crazy World of Arthur Brown-Fire  (1968) COL channel name VAL elodd90 COL description VAL "Fire" is a 1968 song by Arthur Brown\, Vincent Crane\, Mike Finesilver and Peter Ker. Performed by the Crazy World of Arthur Brown\, it was released as a single and on the band's debut album\, also called The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. The single made #1 in the UK (in August 1968) and Canada. In October\, it made #2 in the US Billboard charts and #19 in Australia. It also made number 6 in The Netherlands.  The song is an example of the psychedelic rock of the period\, though its lack of guitars distinguished it from many of its contemporaries. The lead instrument in this case was Vincent Crane's Hammond electronic organ\, augmented by an orchestral section featuring prominent brass. The singer's opening proclamation of himself as "the god of hellfire" became a lasting epithet.  *i posted this video only for entertainment purposes*	0

It was released in Australia in mid 1975 on a Bootleg 45\, BL-249. It charted in Adelaide (# 37)\, but failed to find much favour anywhere else in Australia.  The flipside is the excellent country/rock track\, "Fire At Shepard's Flat"\, which I've also uploaded to YouTube.

It is widely regarded by many as the band's signature song. "Cherry Bomb" was also ranked 52nd on VH1's 100 Greatest Hard Rock Songs.  The song was used in the cult classic film Dazed and Confused\, and was featured on the soundtrack. It can also be heard as a partial cover song by JoJo in the movie RV and was covered by Dakota Fanning and Kristen Stewart\, who played Cherie Currie and Joan Jett\, for the 2010 biopic film The Runaways. The song has been re-recorded by Jett and Currie to be featured in the video game Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock as a playable song.  This song is also covered by Verbal + Yoon on Dr. Marten's 50th anniversary compilation disc.  ------------------------  Shonen Knife\, written in Japanese characters as Â∞ëÂπ¥„Éä„Ç§„Éï\, which transliterates as Sh≈çnen Naifu\, literally "Boy Knife\," is an all-female Japanese pop-punk band formed in Osaka\, Japan\, in 1981. Heavily influenced by 1960s girl groups\, pop bands\, The Beach Boys\, and early punk rock acts\, such as the Ramones\, the trio crafts stripped-down songs expressing infectious melodies and simplistic\, exuberant lyrics sung both in Japanese and English.  Despite their pop-oriented nature\, the trio maintains a distinctly underground garage rock sound rooted in edgy instrumentation and D.I.Y. aesthetics\, which over the course of their long career has earned them a solid\, worldwide cult following and made avid fans out of seminal '90s alternative rock acts such as Sonic Youth\, Nirvana\, and Redd Kross. The band has been credited with making "the international pop underground more international" by "opening it up to bands from Japan". They have also performed as a Ramones tribute band under the name The Osaka Ramones.  ------------------------  Lyrics  Can't stay at home\, can't stay at school  Old folks say\, you poor little fool.

COL title VAL Have Thine Own Way Lord COL performer VAL Barbara Mandrell	COL video title VAL YVONNE ELLIMAN Hello Stranger COL channel name VAL daveinprogress3 COL description VAL Hawaiian beauty\, Yvonne Elliman\, was not on the pop landscape all that long\, but she made her impact\, and her gorgeous face and sweet but powerful vocals graced the 1970's with a distinctive air. I am posting "Hello Stranger"\, as it is not one of her bigger chart successes\, but it does showcase her wonderful voice and it is a very seventies take on the 60's Barbara Lewis classic.  35 years ago\, "Love me"\, written by the Bee Gees\, was a breakout hit for Yvonne\, giving her a worldwide hit\, including Australia\, where it would ascend the charts and reach #4 in the late summer of 1977. "Hello Stranger" was discovered by me\, once again courtesy of a Various Artist compile - the sexy styled "Ripper 77" with the curvaceous cheeks of a woman adorned with lipstick writing of the names of the 20 original artists featured on the record.  "Hello Stranger"\, like several of the hits on this compile\, was not a hit in Australia\, but three and a half decades later\, it is a fondly considered musical postcard from the era\, and i am eternally grateful to the record companies for releasing those compilations\, even if some of the inclusions were bizarre and obscure.  Back in the halcyon days of the late 1970's\, radio airplay and tv shows like "Countdown" and "Sounds Unlimited" were the few outlets for songs to receive exposure. So many fine recordings were simply overlooked\, because of the few opportunities for visibility or audibility at the time.   1978 would be the major year for Yvonne with another Gibb brothers extravaganza giving her the biggest success of her career with the #1 smash "If I can't have you"\, from  the pop & disco juggernaut "Saturday Night Fever". Another movie soundtrack "Moment by Moment" also starring John Travolta\, would see another recording by Yvonne Elliman - the title track\, but the gentle ballad could not break through the endless litany of disco hits that monopolised 1979. Her own "Love Pains" was her final hit from that part of her career\, and it is a much loved and much covered anthem from the disco era.  I hope "Hello Stranger" gives whoever hears it\, the joy that it has given me.	0

I've only added the footage as a tribute for historical\, entertainment\, and creative purposes with no financial gain. Copyright infringement not intended.  The Four Tunes "I Sold My Heart To The Junkman" Jubilee 5174 A 1954  Here are The Four Tunes with their version of "I Sold My Heart To The Junkman." This is the 2nd pressing that was released in 1954 by Jubilee\, in the same year as the 1st pressing. A nice\, minty\, clean 78 for your enjoyment.  The 4 Tunes were probably the leading black Pop vocal group during the 1950s. Their origins can be traced back to a change of personnel in the Ink Spots. This requires a brief review of some events in the mid-40s. In June 1944\, during an engagement in Chicago\, Hoppy Jones became ill and the group had to finish a tour without him (Deek Watson filled in on the mandatory talking parts). This had unsuspected ramifications. Hoppy was the conciliatory father figure (nicknamed "the grand old man") of the Ink Spots. Now that he was missing\, infighting between Bill Kenny and Deek Watson\, which had formerly just smoldered\, now flared up unchecked. Deek had been the leader of the group until their 1939 smash of "If I Didn't Care." Since then\, Bill had firmly established himself in the forefront of the Ink Spots\, pushing Deek further and further into the background. Hoppy returned in August\, but by then\, the damage had been done.  When he announced (in the January 1945 settlement of the lawsuits) that he would form a new group based "on a completely new idea\," he simply changed their name to the "Brown Dots" (the name does sound somewhat familiar\, doesn't it?). As it turned out\, the "new idea" was to sound as much like the Ink Spots as possible. One real difference was that the Brown Dots relied more on harmony than the Ink Spots\, who were more individualists. (Since the Brown Dots were also managed by Moe Gale\, we know who the hands-down winner in this contest was.)  The polished style of the 4 Tunes was the product of their training\, experience\, dedication\, and discipline. Their songs were carefully selected and arranged. Their first arranger was pianist Ralph Herman\, who was the youngest member of Paul Whiteman's Orchestra. They also worked with Howard Biggs (whose most famous association was with the Ravens).  In mid-1953\, they once again changed labels (since they weren't making any royalties from RCA). This time they went to Jerry Blaine's Jubilee label\, where they achieved their greatest popularity. Their first Jubilee recording\, "Marie\," was released in September\, and reached #2 on the R&B charts (#13 Pop). This Irving Berlin tune had been a #1 smash for Tommy Dorsey (Jack Leonard on vocal) back in 1937. ("Marie" was such a big hit that the purely R&B Dominoes and Larks were pushed to sing in the same kind of Pop mold.) Their next Jubilee release\, "I Understand Just How You Feel" was an even bigger hit\, climbing to #6 on the Pop charts (#7 R&B).  1954 saw two releases on the Kay-Ron label. These were old Manor cuts (although different takes). Two of them were backups to Savannah Churchill ("Savannah Sings The Blues" and "I Want To Be Loved"). The other two were "Just In Case You Change Your Mind" (which was actually by the Brown Dots) and "I Understand" (which was presumably released to confuse record buyers into thinking it was the same song as the current "I Understand Just How You Feel").  On Jubilee\, the 4 Tunes were primarily a Pop group (although they did turn out something called "Rock N Roll Call"). Their output included "Don't Cry Darling\," "L'amour\, Toujours L'amour\," "I Sold My Heart To The Junkman\," "Time Out For Tears\," "You Are My Love\," "Far Away Places\," "Dancing With Tears In My Eyes\," "Sayonara\," and "A Little On The Lonely Side."  The 4 Tunes appeared for a week at the Apollo Theater (beginning April 2\, 1955)\, along with Red Prysock's Orchestra. They played both the black theater circuit and also many white clubs. When they were on a tour with Joni James\, she asked Jimmie Nabbie to write a song for her. The result\, "You Are My Love\," was her big hit of 1955 (which the 4 Tunes covered).  In 1955\, the 4 Tunes were booked into the Hacienda in Las Vegas on a handshake\, and stayed for eight years. Other members\, added at the time\, were Smiley Hightower (guitar and bassist) and Eddie Williams (bassist; formerly of Johnny Moore's Three Blazers). Also\, tenor Billy Wells (from Deek's second Brown Dots group) was hired so that each of the other members could go on vacation on a rotating basis.

Finds a streetlight\, steps out of the shade Says something like\, "You and me babe\, how about it?"  Juliet says\, "Hey\, it's Romeo\, you nearly gave me a heart attack!" He's underneath the window\, she's singing\, "Hey la\, my boyfriend's back. You shouldn't come around here singing up to people like that... Anyway\, what you gonna do about it?"  ROMEO: Juliet\, the dice was loaded from the start And I bet when you exploded into my heart And I forget I forget the movie song. When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong\, Juliet?  Come up on different streets\, they're both the streets of shame. Both dirty\, both mean\, yes\, in the dream it was just the same And I dreamed your dream for you and now your dream is real. How can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals?  When you can fall for chains of silver\,  You can fall for chains of gold\, You can fall for pretty strangers  And the promises they hold. You promised me everything\, you promised me thick and thin\, yeah! Now you just say\, "Oh Romeo? Yeah\, you know I used to have a scene with him".  Juliet\, when we made love\, you used to cry. You said\, "I love you like the stars above\, I'll love you 'til I die". There's a place for us\, you know the movie song. When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong\, Juliet?  I can't do the talk\, like the talk on TV And I can't do a love song\, like the way it's meant to be. I can't do everything\, but I'll do anything for you. I can't do anything\, 'cept be in love with you! And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be. All I do is keep the beat... and bad company. Now all I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme\, Juliet\, I'd do the stars with you any time!  Juliet\, when we made love you used to cry. You said\, "I love you like the stars above\, I'll love you 'til I die". There's a place for us\, you know the movie song. When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong\, Juliet?

COL title VAL Mysterious Ways COL performer VAL U2	COL video title VAL Al Hirt: Up Above My Head COL channel name VAL davidhertzberg1 COL description VAL From the LP "Sugar Lips\," issued in 1964 by RCA (LPM-2965\, monaural).  Al Hirt (1922-1999)\, trumpet\, with chorus and orchestra.  Recorded in RCA Victor's "Nashville Sound" Studio\, Nashville\, Tennessee.  Produced by Chet Atkins; recording engineer\, Chuck Seitz.  ----------------------------------------------------------- Al Hirt wurde als Sohn eines Polizeibeamten geboren; er war unter dem Namen ‚ÄûAl" oder ‚ÄûJumbo" bekannt. Im Alter von sechs Jahren begann er Trompete zu spielen und mit 16 war er beruflich Trompeter. Im Jahr 1940 ging er nach Cincinnati\, um am dortigen Musikkonservatorium  zu studieren.  Nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg spielte er in mehreren Swing-Big-Bands. W√§hrend der 1960er-Jahre galt Hirt neben Herb Alpert als einer der popul√§rsten Trompeter; er wurde ausgew√§hlt\, die Titelmusik zu der in den 1960er-Jahren laufenden TV-Show The Green Hornet einzuspielen. Dieses St√ºck wurde von Billy May arrangiert\, wobei das Thema auf Nikolai Rimski-Korsakows ‚ÄûHummelflug" basiert\, und bewies Hirts technische Raffinesse. Das St√ºck erlangte wieder an Popularit√§t\, als es 2003 bei Quentin Tarantinos Film Kill Bill Teil des Soundtracks wurde. In New Orleans f√ºhrte er einige Jahre einen eigenen Club.  Hirt starb im Jahr 1999 an Leberversagen\, nachdem er einige Jahre aufgrund eines √ñdems im Rollstuhl verbracht hatte. ----------------------------------------------------------- Al Hirt - ameryka≈Ñski trƒôbacz jazzowy i kierownik zespo≈Çu muzycznego.  Studiowa≈Ç w konserwatorium w Cincinnati. Wystƒôpowa≈Ç jako pierwszy trƒôbacz w zespo≈Çach Tommy Dorseya\, Jimmy'ego Dorseya\, Raya McKinleya.

Najpopularniejsze nagrania: "Java"\, "Fancy Plants"\, "Just Because"\, "Personality"\, "Panama"\, "Jazz Mr. Blues"\, "Sugar Lips". ----------------------------------------------------------- Al Hirt √©tait le fils d'un officier de police. √Ä l'√¢ge de 6 ans\, il re√ßoit sa premi√®re trompette. Il joue dans le Junior Police Band avec les enfants d'Alcide Yellow Nunez et √† 16 ans\, Hirt joue en tant que professionnel\, souvent avec son ami Pete Fountain. Il est engag√© par un hippodrome voisin pour y jouer.  En 1940\, Hirt se d√©place √† Cincinnati dans l'Ohio pour √©tudier au Cincinnati Conservatory of Music aupr√®s du Dr. Frank Simon (un ancien soliste de l'orchestre de John Philip Sousa). Durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale\, Hirt joue du clairon dans l'arm√©e am√©ricaine\, puis il joue aux c√¥t√©s de plusieurs big bands de swing dont ceux de Tommy Dorsey\, Jimmy Dorsey\, Benny Goodman\, et Ina Rae Hutton. En 1950\, il devient le trompettiste principal de l'orchestre d'Horace Heidt.  Il retourne ensuite √† la Nouvelle-Orl√©ans o√π il aide et m√®ne plusieurs groupes de Dixieland. Malgr√© les d√©clarations de Hirt plusieurs ann√©es plus tard\, Je ne suis pas un trompettiste de jazz et ne fut jamais un trompettiste de jazz\, il enregistra quelques morceaux o√π il montra sa capacit√© √† jouer ce style durant les ann√©es 1950\, en particulier avec Monk Hazel. Il enregistra √©galement pour le label Southland Records.  La dext√©rit√© de Hirt et son style attira rapidement l'attention des labels nationaux. Hirt avait 22 albums dans les Billboard Pop charts durant les ann√©es 50 et 60. Les albums Honey In The Horn et Cotton Candy √©taient tous deux au sommet des charts des meilleures ventes de disque pour l'ann√©e 1964. La m√™me ann√©e\, Hirt r√©ussit √† atteindre le sommet du classement gr√¢ce au morceau Java.	0

Lord\, look at me here\, I'm rooted like a tree here\, Got those sit-down\, can't cry Oh Lord\, gonna die blues.  Now I had a woman Lord\, she lived down by the mine\, She ain't never seen the sun\, Oh Lord\, never stopped crying.  Then one day my woman up and died\, Lord\, she up and died now. Oh Lord\, she up and died now. She wanted to die\, And the only way to fly is die\, die\, die.  There's a high flyin' bird\, flying way up in the sky\, And I wonder if she looks down as she goes on by? Well\, she's flying so freely in the sky.

Following their footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors\, Of silent desperation\, never speaking to a soul. The poison air he's breathing has the dirty smell of dying\, 'Cos it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain. But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes\, Of the clicking of the turnstiles and the rattle of his chains.  "Oh\," she said: "Casey\, it's been so long since I've seen you. "Here\," she said: "just a kiss to make a body smile. "See\," she said: "I've put on new stockings just to please you. "Lord\," she said. "Casey\, can you only stay a while."  Casey leaves the underground and stops inside The Golden Crown\, For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bones. Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men\, Who reach for anything they can to keep from going home. Standing in the corner\, Casey drinks his pint of bitter\, Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by. Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason\, Is the beer that's in his belly or the tear that's in his eye.  "Oh\," she said: "I suppose you seldom think about me. "Now\," she said: "now that you've a family of your own. "Still\," she said: "It's so blessed good to feel your body. "Lord\," she said: "Casey\, it's a shame to be alone."	0

Join our Youtube: https://goo.gl/8AOGaN Join our Facebook: http://goo.gl/5oL723 Bob Dylan (/Ààd…™l…ôn/; born Robert Allen Zimmerman\, May 24\, 1941) is an American singer-songwriter\, artist\, and writer. He has been an influential figure in popular music and culture for more than five decades. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s\, when he was both a chronicler and a reluctant figurehead of social unrest. A number of Dylan's early songs\, such as "Blowin' in the Wind" and "The Times They Are a-Changin'"\, became anthems for the American civil rights and anti-war movements. Leaving behind his initial base in the culture of the folk music revival\, Dylan's six-minute single "Like a Rolling Stone" radically altered the parameters of popular music in 1965. His mid-1960s recordings\, backed by rock musicians\, reached the top end of the United States music charts while also attracting denunciation and criticism from others in the folk movement.

COL title VAL Some Velvet Morning COL performer VAL Entombed	COL video title VAL Ivan Cattaneo "Il Volto della Vita" @ "Parola Mia" - 1986 COL channel name VAL Ivan Cattaneo Official FanPage Channel COL description VAL Ivan fu ospite per tre puntate a "Parola mia" il programma-quiz culturale condotto da Luciano Rispoli negli studi della Rai di Torino. In questa puntata (la seconda delle tre) propose "Il volto della vita"\, lanciato in Italia da Caterina Caselli ma gi√† noto negli States col titolo "The Days Of Pearly Spencer". Il brano in questione √® contenuto col nuovo titolo de "La sirena di Ipanema" nell'album "Vietato ai minori" terzo capitolo della trilogia cover realizzata da Ivan nell'81 (Duemila60 Italian Graffiati)\, nell'83 (Bandiera gialla) e nell'86 appunto con "Vietato ai minori".   Il Volto Della Vita  Con il corpo sono qui ma la mente mia non c'√®\, corre dietro a dei ricordi e chi la ferma pi√π. I miei occhi sono chiusi\, ma ci vedo molto bene\, son davanti ad una casa\, entro e vedo te...  Il volto della vita... Il volto dell'amore.  Rose rosse alle pareti\, giochi d'ombra sul tuo viso\, come rami le mie braccia si apron verso te. Ed ancora la mia mente non √® stanca di vagare e mi porta lungo un fiume e in fondo vedo te.  Il volto della vita... Il volto dell'amore...  Sei vestito un poco strano ma d'altronde\, come sempre\, il mio cuore ti fa festa\, sono a un passo da te. Ma qualcuno ha bussato e il mio viaggio √® terminato\, io mi alzo per aprire\, apro e vedo te...  Il volto della vita... Il volto dell'amore... Il volto della vita...	0

COL title VAL About a Quarter to Nine COL performer VAL Al Jolson	COL video title VAL Sonny James - Endlessly (The Johnny Cash Show - Jan 27\, 1971) COL channel name VAL John1948TwelveA COL description VAL Sonny James\, the Southern Gentleman\, used the popular Nashville sound of the '60s to countrify pop hits of the past into a form accessible to many\, broadening country music's appeal across the nation. James even moved over to the pop charts for a time in the late '50s but found the secret of his success by the time he returned to country. During the late '60s\, he scored an incredible five-year run of number one singles which locked up the top spot for a combined 45 weeks during the late '60s.   Born James Loden on May 1\, 1929\, he began performing with his show-business family at the age of three and played with his four sisters as the Loden Family while in his teens. The group appeared around the South and on radio shows like the Louisiana Hayride and Saturday Night Shindig. After spending time overseas during the Korean War\, Loden took Sonny James as his stage name -- after his teenage nickname -- and joined the local bar circuit. He met and played with Chet Atkins\, who later got him a tryout with Capitol Records. The label liked what it heard and offered James a contract.   His first single\, "That's Me Without You\," hit the country Top Ten in early 1953\, but it was three years before "For Rent (One Empty Heart)" became his second big hit. James\, who played guitar on virtually all of his records\, followed up with two 1956 Top Ten near-misses "Twenty Feet of Muddy Water" and "The Cat Came Back." His next single became his biggest hit: "Young Love" spent nine weeks at number one during 1956-1957 and crossed over to top the pop charts also.   Beginning in 1957\, James began to focus his attention on the popular charts. "First Date\, First Kiss\, First Love" made the Top 25\, but no follow-up placed as high. Several of his failures had still managed to go Top Ten on the country charts\, so James returned to country with a vengeance in 1964. "You're the Only World I Know" hit number one country late that year and spent four weeks atop the chart.   That began one of the greatest tears country music has ever known: 21 of his next 25 singles hit number one (and the other four near-misses hit either two or three). James completely dominated the chart from 1964 to 1972\, though only several singles crossed over for modest placements on the popular charts. That fact is somewhat surprising\, since three-quarters of James' number ones had previously been pop hits\, including "Take Good Care of Her" for Adam Wade\, "I'll Never Find Another You" and "A World of Our Own" for the Seekers\, "Born to Be With You" for the Chordettes\, and Roy Orbison's "Only the Lonely." Backed by his Southern Gentlemen band\, James toured the country and overseas\, appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show\, Hee Haw\, and The Bob Hope Show\, and made several movies\, including Las Vegas Hillbillies (1966)\, Second Fiddle to a Steel Guitar (1967)\, and Nashville Rebel (1967). Billboard named him the Number One Artist of 1969.   Even after James' number one streak ended in January 1972\, he continued to place high on the charts. The number two "Only Love Can Break a Heart" (a pop hit for Gene Pitney ten years earlier) was followed by the number ones "That's Why I Love You Like I Do" and -- after moving to Columbia in mid-1972 -- "When the Snow Is on the Roses." James' next chart-topping single\, "Is It Wrong (For Loving You)\," was released in March 1974\, and it began his last major run. He followed with four consecutive Top Ten hits\, "A Mi Esposa con Amor (To My Wife With Love)\," "A Little Bit South of Saskatoon\," "Little Band of Gold\," and "What in the World's Come Over You."   By the early '70s\, James had moved into producing and music publishing also; he oversaw three of Marie Osmond's albums and still managed occasional Top Tens himself. He picked up the prestigious award of Country Music's Male Artist of the Decade from Record World in 1977 and moved to the Monument label in 1979\, then to Dimension two years later. He retired in 1983\, and now raises cattle in Alabama.   ~ John Bush\, All Music Guide  PLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels\, Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

COL title VAL Let It Go COL performer VAL Tanner Townsend - Gardiner Sisters	COL video title VAL Roots of Blues  Mississippi John Hurt ‚ÄûCandy Man Blues COL channel name VAL Literatisch COL description VAL ‚ÄûCandy Man Blues (J. Hurt)  Recorded: New York City\, December 28\,1928 Mississippi John Hurt (vcl)(g).  Born John Smith Hurt in Teoc\,  Carroll County\, Mississippi and raised in Avalon\, Mississippi\, Hurt learned to play guitar at age 9. He spent much of his youth playing old time music for friends and dances\, earning a living as a farm hand into the 1920s. In 1923 he partnered with the fiddle player Willie Narmour as a substitute for his regular partner Shell Smith. When Narmour got a chance to record for Okeh Records as a prize for winning first place in a 1928 fiddle contest\, Narmour recommended John Hurt to Okeh Records producer Tommy Rockwell. After auditioning "Monday Morning Blues" at his home\, he took part in two recording sessions\, in Memphis and New York City (see Discography below). The "Mississippi" tag was added by Okeh as a sales gimmick. After the commercial failure of the resulting records\, and Okeh Records going out of business during the Great Depression\, Hurt returned to Avalon and obscurity\, working as a sharecropper and playing local parties and dances.  In 1963\, however\, a folk musicologist\, Tom Hoskins\, inspired by the recordings\, was able to locate Hurt near Avalon\, Mississippi. Seeing that Hurt's guitar playing skills were still intact\, Hoskins encouraged him to move to Washington\, D.C.\, and begin performing on a wider stage. His performance at the 1964 Newport Folk Festival saw his star rise amongst the new folk revival audience. Before his death he played extensively in colleges\, concert halls\, coffee houses and also on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson\, as well as recording three further albums for Vanguard Records. The numbers his devotees particularly liked were the ragtime songs "Salty Dog" and "Candy Man"\, and the blues ballads "Spike Driver Blues" (a variant of "John Henry") and "Frankie".  Hurt's influence spanned several music genres including blues\, country\, bluegrass\, folk and contemporary rock and roll. A soft-spoken man\, his nature was reflected in the work\, which remained a mellow mix of country\, blues and old time music to the end.[7]  Hurt died in November 1966 from a heart attack in Grenada\, Mississippi	0

COL title VAL Ich wei√ü\, es wird einmal ein Wunder geschehen COL performer VAL The Feetwarmers	COL video title VAL IRENE REID I wonder where our love has gone (1965) COL channel name VAL OubaelPhoumet COL description VAL album : Room for one more.  Room for One More pairs singer Irene Reid with arranger Oliver Nelson and a sprawling who's who of session players including Thad Jones\, Charlie Mariano\, Kenny Burrell\, Phil Woods\, and J.J. Johnson. The title's more than a bit tongue in cheek\, of course\, but given the stature of her collaborators\, Reid no doubt felt some pressure to prove herself worthy of occupying the same studio space\, let alone to claim top billing\, but she does so admirably\, rendering classics like "Save Your Love for Me" and "I Wonder Where Our Love Has Gone" with extraordinary emotional potency. Although best suited for ballads\, most notably a breathtaking reading of "Who Can I Turn To?\," Reid is such a nimble stylist that even a throwaway number like the Bewitched theme still makes its mark. Nelson's spacious arrangements are sublime\, and it almost goes without saying that the band is exemplary. In short\, a wonderful if little-known LP in desperate need of reissue.	0

It is widely regarded by many as the band's signature song. "Cherry Bomb" was also ranked 52nd on VH1's 100 Greatest Hard Rock Songs.  The song was used in the cult classic film Dazed and Confused\, and was featured on the soundtrack. It can also be heard as a partial cover song by JoJo in the movie RV and was covered by Dakota Fanning and Kristen Stewart\, who played Cherie Currie and Joan Jett\, for the 2010 biopic film The Runaways. The song has been re-recorded by Jett and Currie to be featured in the video game Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock as a playable song.  This song is also covered by Verbal + Yoon on Dr. Marten's 50th anniversary compilation disc.  ------------------------  Shonen Knife\, written in Japanese characters as Â∞ëÂπ¥„Éä„Ç§„Éï\, which transliterates as Sh≈çnen Naifu\, literally "Boy Knife\," is an all-female Japanese pop-punk band formed in Osaka\, Japan\, in 1981. Heavily influenced by 1960s girl groups\, pop bands\, The Beach Boys\, and early punk rock acts\, such as the Ramones\, the trio crafts stripped-down songs expressing infectious melodies and simplistic\, exuberant lyrics sung both in Japanese and English.  Despite their pop-oriented nature\, the trio maintains a distinctly underground garage rock sound rooted in edgy instrumentation and D.I.Y. aesthetics\, which over the course of their long career has earned them a solid\, worldwide cult following and made avid fans out of seminal '90s alternative rock acts such as Sonic Youth\, Nirvana\, and Redd Kross. The band has been credited with making "the international pop underground more international" by "opening it up to bands from Japan". They have also performed as a Ramones tribute band under the name The Osaka Ramones.  ------------------------  Lyrics  Can't stay at home\, can't stay at school  Old folks say\, you poor little fool.

COL title VAL All I've Got to Do COL performer VAL George Martin and His Orchestra	COL video title VAL Bob Wills & His Texas Playboys - Yearning Just for You (1938) COL channel name VAL ASACurator COL description VAL Bob Wills was the driving force behind Western Swing\, a form of Country & Western that fuses Jazz\, Hillbilly\, Blues\, Big Band Swing\, and many more rhythm forms together creating a  truly Unique\, Diverse and Unforgettable sound. Wills' shrewd mix of horns\, fiddles and steel guitar made for a swinging sound that grabbed the public's ear during the mid 1930s and 1940s. Bob Wills was born into a family of fiddlers on March 6\, 1905. His father\, John Wills  regularly won Texas fiddling competitions. Bob learned how to play fiddle and mandolin from his father. As a young man\, Wills performed at house dances\, medicine shows and in 1929 made his debut on the radio.  With commercial sponsorship\, Wills' bands performed on radio in the early 1930s as "Aladdin's Laddies" (for the Aladdin Lamp Co.) and "The Light Crust Doughboys" (for Light Crust Flour). Following a salary dispute\, Wills renamed his band the Texas Playboys and relocated to Tulsa\, Oklahoma\, where he had a live radio show. This exposure led to a contract with the American Recording Corporation - later absorbed into Columbia Records. In September 1935\, Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys recorded their first songs in a makeshift  recording studio in an old Dallas Warehouse. From that point on\, The Texas Playboys became an overnight sensation and recorded prolifically and made such classics as "Steel Guitar Rag"\, "Maiden's Prayer"\, "Take Me Back to Tulsa" and Wills' signature song\, "San Antonio Rose".  Their biggest hit\, was "New Spanish Two Step"\, which topped the country charts for 16 weeks in 1946. The Texas Playboys always had fine singers like Tommy Duncan and Leon McAuliffe\, and Wills punctuated the tunes with jive talking\, falsetto asides and cries of "Ah-ha!" He'd call out soloists by name and instrument\, good-naturedly goading them on to rollicking solo performances. In terms of personnel\, The Texas Playboys expanded and contracted over the years\, according to Wills' desires and the whims of the market. At one point the Texas Playboys were 22 pieces strong\, although the band more typically numbered between 9 and 18 members. There were personnel changes and musical shifts as Wills struggled to adapt to the changing face of  America in the postwar era. Nonetheless\, there was always a solid core of loyal regulars in The Texas Playboys. After leaving Columbia in 1947\, Wills continued to record prolifically for such labels as MGM\, Decca\, Longhorn and Kapp. The group also toured the country and often performed  at a Wills-owned dancehall in Sacramento\, California. In 1968\, Wills was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. A year later\, he suffered a debilitating stroke. There were reunions and recording sessions with many of the old Texas Playboys in 1971 and 1973. Wills' final stroke came in his sleep following the first day of a recording session in December 1973 that resulted in the double album "For the Last Time". Confined to a wheelchair\, he'd reprised his role as bandleader that day with a group of musicians that included former Texas Playboys. He never regained consciousness and died 18 months later on May 13\, 1975. Wills has been revered by such country-music legends as Waylon Jennings\, Willie Nelson\, George Straight\, and Merle Haggard who made a 1976 remake of Bob's 1941 hit "Cherokee Maiden". The contemporary Western Swing group\, Asleep at the Wheel has also cut a pair of tribute albums that have kept Wills' name before the public. Every year\, Bob Wills Day is celebrated on the last Saturday in April in Turkey\, Texas.	0

Mae'r term 'hen ferchetan' yn golygu dynes sydd heb briodi. Traditional Welsh folk song. The term 'hen ferchetan' means a woman who has never married.  The translation 'old maid' doesn't mean that the maid in question is actually old of age :-)  Geiriau: Hen ferchetan wedi colli'i chariad\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. Cael un arall\, dyna oedd ei bwriad\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.

Hen ferchetan sydd yn dal i drio\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. Gwisgo lase sidan ac ymbincio\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.

But none of the village boys\,  ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, wanted to marry Lisa fach yr Hendre\,  ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  An old maid keeps on trying\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. Wore satin lace and make up\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  But if there's someone for everyone somewhere\, ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, there is no one for Lisa fach yr Hendre\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.

COL title VAL I Walk on Guilded Splinters COL performer VAL Widespread Panic featuring The Dirty Dozen Brass Band	COL video title VAL Ruby Wright - Bimbo COL channel name VAL AFantasticVoyage COL description VAL VARIOUS: THEN 1954  1954 -- now\, that's what we call an exceptional year! Perhaps best remembered in Britain for the end of rationing after 14 years\, 1954 also saw the marriage of Marilyn Monroe to Joe Di Maggio\, the first royal tour of Australia\, the breaking of the four-minute mile by runner Roger Bannister\, and the first World Cup to be televised.  Much memorable music was also made that year\, and you can hear many of the most popular hits from back then right now on THEN 1954\, continuing the new series from Fantastic Voyage\, the label that brings you the highly popular British Hit Parade compilations. Unlike that series\, which provides two multi-disc sets per year intended for the serious chart completists out there\, the THEN series has the more casual music buyer in mind.  Although THEN 1953 includes many UK and US chart-toppers\, the series is not constrained by chart position or label in its aim of presenting the most memorable sounds of each year. Successive volumes of THEN will follow over the coming months. Each one is compiled and annotated by eminent chartwatcher Dave McAleer\, the former chief consultant and contributor to the now defunct Guinness Book Of British Hit Singles\, who is currently devising pop quiz books for the Official Charts Company and assisting with the Virgin Book Of British Hit Albums.  Dave's sleeve notes spend as much time recalling the news events of the year as they do exploring the musical highlights. If you are looking to build up a library of the most enduring British hits from each year\, THEN is the series for you. If you are looking for a souvenir of a particular year -- to remember a birth\, a first kiss\, or a wedding -- THEN will provide the soundtrack to those memories.	0

I'm pulling through and it's because of you When I was stranded came your helping hand Lonely\, hurt\, I had not known which way to turn Till you said 'That's bad\, not tears\, just laugh and learn'.  I'm pullin' through and it's because of you You made me see how lovely life could be Lifted up my heart and made me count the costs To find I'd gained\, not lost.  When I thought that hope was really gone You showed me I was wrong And you taught me how to carry on Thanks for the lift in time and thanks for this song.  I'm pulling through and it's because of you I'd do the same for you if your turn came Hope it never will for I've been through the mill I won't forget this debt\, I'm pulling through.	0

His stepmother\, Virginia Lee - the "Queen of Song" of the early 1960's - introduced him to the recording studio in the 1960s\, and in 1970 he recorded "Sally Sunshine" which went to No.1 on the then popular LM Radio Top 20\, and to number 11 on the South African Top 20 in 1971. He also did radio adverts and sang harmony for many well-known artists of the time\, and he was the first voice of "Sarel Seemonster" on the popular Afrikaans TV show 'Wielie Walie'.  He did voice copies of international hits for the highly successful Springbok Hits Album series\, and was then offered a contract to record a country album called "Ruby"\, which was released in 1978. When TV came on to the scene he appeared with the band "Timepiece"\, and thereafter was invited to do solo spots on various shows and several New Year Specials.  Around this time he was invited to be a guest on many of Bobby Angel's "Gentle on my Mind" programmes\, and Lance James started playing his songs on "Keep it Country". In 1985 he was approached to present "Sing Country" on TV4. It was broadcast every Sunday night and recorded at the Zillertal Restaurant in Pretoria.  In 1993 he started presenting "REWIND"\, a video request programme on TV1 and in 1996 he recorded his first gold album - "One Last Kiss". He has performed in the Sun City Superbowl several times and still continues to travel and perform all around the country. He stays in Pretoria.  This song is off the album "Ruby"\, released in 1978. It's a cover of a Kris Kristofferson song from 1972.	0

At the dawn of the new millennium\, songwriter\, producer\, and multi- instrumentalist Klayton created Celldweller\, a ground-breaking aural entity for the next age. Thriving on originality\, Celldweller cross-bred electronic styles such as Drum'n'Bass and Psy-Trance with modern Alternative Rock and Metal on his self-titled debut\, released independently in 2003.  The Celldweller album met with critical acclaim while climbing to #17 on the Billboard Internet Sales Chart. Celldweller gained Top 40 Metal Radio charting with the track "I Believe You" pulling into a solid 11th place on the R&R Alternative Specialty Show Chart. Achieving a feat shared by only an elite handful of albums\, every song on Celldweller was eventually licensed for use in popular media. These songs were heard in movie trailers\, TV shows\, and games such as Spider Man 2\, Constantine\, Crackdown\, Need for Speed: Most Wanted\, Enter the Matrix\, CSI\, UFC\, The Shield\, and more.  Now\, Celldweller has been reissued to celebrate the tenth anniversary of its release with updated artwork and a second disc of remixes\, demos\, and previously unheard rarities (all remastered for this release). While Klayton busies himself in his Detroit studio preparing the future of Celldweller for 2013\, celebrate the past with this monumental work.  Want to use FiXT music in your YouTube videos?

They told me that you came this way Brother\, where are you? They said you came this way  The eyes of the people who passed him by Were cold and hard as stone The poor boy whimpered and began to cry Because he was all alone  Brother\, where are you? They told me that you came this way Brother\, where are you? They said you came this way  Now there are many Who will swear that it's true That brothers are we all Yet it seems there are very few Who will answer a brother's call  Brother\, where are you?

I drove all night Crept in your room Woke you from your sleep To make love to you Is that all right? I drove all night  What in this world Keeps us from falling apart? No matter where I go I hear The beating of our one heart I think about you When the night is cold and dark\, uh-huh\, yeah No one can move me The way that you do Nothing erases this feeling between me and you\, oh  I drove all night to get to you Is that all right? I drove all night Crept in your room Woke you from your sleep To make love to you Is that all right? I drove all night  I taste your sweet kisses Your arms open wide This fever for you is just burning me up inside  I drove all night to get to you Is that all right? I drove all night Crept in your room Is that all right? I drove all night (I drove all night) I drove all night (To get to you) To get to you (Is that all right?) Is that all right?

Il Volto Della Vita  Con il corpo sono qui ma la mente mia non c'√®\, corre dietro a dei ricordi e chi la ferma pi√π. I miei occhi sono chiusi\, ma ci vedo molto bene\, son davanti ad una casa\, entro e vedo te...  Il volto della vita... Il volto dell'amore.  Rose rosse alle pareti\, giochi d'ombra sul tuo viso\, come rami le mie braccia si apron verso te. Ed ancora la mia mente non √® stanca di vagare e mi porta lungo un fiume e in fondo vedo te.  Il volto della vita... Il volto dell'amore...  Sei vestito un poco strano ma d'altronde\, come sempre\, il mio cuore ti fa festa\, sono a un passo da te. Ma qualcuno ha bussato e il mio viaggio √® terminato\, io mi alzo per aprire\, apro e vedo te...  Il volto della vita... Il volto dell'amore... Il volto della vita...	0

COL title VAL She Drives Me Crazy COL performer VAL The Flying Pickets	COL video title VAL LUTHER INGRAM-ain't hat loving you(for more reason than one) COL channel name VAL pieroangelo2 COL description VAL Born Luther Thomas Ingram in Jackson\, Tennessee\, his early interest in music led to him making his first record in 1965 at the age of 28. His first three recordings failed to chart but that changed when he signed for KoKo Records in the late 1960s\, and his first hit "My Honey And Me" peaked at #55 on the Hot 100 on 14 February 1970. Many of his songs appeared in the pop and R&B charts\, even though Koko was only a small label\, owned by his manager and record producer\, Johnny Baylor. Koko and Baylor were closely associated with the Memphis based Stax Records label during the height of its commercial success.   Ingram is best known for the hit\, "(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want to Be Right"\, written by Homer Banks\, Carl Hampton and Raymond Jackson. The song reached number one on Billboard 's R&B chart and peaked at number three on that publication's Hot 100 chart in the summer of 1972. The track stayed in the Hot 100 for 18 weeks\, ultimately selling a reported four million copies.[1] The song was later successfully covered by Millie Jackson and Barbara Mandrell; it has also been recorded by Bobby "Blue" Bland\, Rod Stewart and Isaac Hayes.   Other popular tracks for Ingram included "Ain't That Loving You (For More Reasons Than One)"\, "Let's Steal Away To The Hideaway" and "I'll Be Your Shelter." He also co-authored "Respect Yourself"\, a million seller for the Staples Singers in 1971.[1] The acetate demo version of Ingram's\, "Exus Trek"\, became a sought after Northern soul track.[2] With the Stax connections\, Ingram recorded at the Memphis label's studios\, as well as other southern-based studios such as Muscle Shoals. He was opening act for Isaac Hayes for some years\, and often used Hayes' Movement band and female backing group for his 1970s recordings. He recorded into the 1980s\, and whilst only managing lower R&B chart hits\, he remained a popular stage draw.   Ingram died on March 19\, 2007\, at a Belleville\, Illinois\, hospital of heart failure. According to his wife Jacqui Ingram\, he had suffered for years from diabetes\, kidney disease and partial blindness	0

COL title VAL Money for Nothing COL performer VAL Dire Straits	COL video title VAL Jessica Williams - Green Chimneys (T.Monk) COL channel name VAL Andr√© Rodrigues Pereira da Silva COL description VAL Review from allmusic:  ¬´Recorded at a special afternoon series sponsored by Chemekata College in Oregon\, Jazz in the Afternoon is a trio date\, with Williams joined by Dave Captein on bass and Mel Brown on drums. The recording is surprisingly dense however\, with Williams spraying notes all over on her solo for the Monk tune "Green Chimneys" which opens the set. Captein and Brown both sound enthused by the sprightly playing and keep up the pace admirably. Williams changes directions often\, moving with a smooth grace from the stately "Light Blue" (another Monk piece) to a barreling "Straight\, No Chaser" (ditto\, obviously) to Gershwin's playful "Swanee." Her playing never falters throughout the 70-minute recording. Though Williams recorded several excellent live albums\, Jazz in the Afternoon is another great addition to her discography. ¬ª	0

He was widely noted for his soft baritone voice\, performing in big band and jazz genres\, and was a major force in popular music for three decades. Cole was one of the first African Americans to host a national television variety show\, The Nat King Cole Show. His recordings remained popular worldwide after his death from lung cancer in February 1965. Nathaniel Adams Coles was born in Montgomery\, Alabama\, on March 17\, 1919. He had three brothers‚ÄîEddie (1910‚Äì1970)\, Ike (1927‚Äì2001)\, and Freddy (born 1931)‚Äîand a half-sister\, Joyce Coles. Each of his brothers pursued careers in music. When Nat was four years old\, he and his family moved to Chicago\, Illinois\, where his father\, Edward Coles\, became a Baptist minister. Nat learned to play the organ from his mother\, Perlina Coles\, the church organist. His first performance was of "Yes! We Have No Bananas" at the age of four. He began formal lessons at 12 and eventually learned not only jazz and gospel music but also Western classical music; he performed "from Johann Sebastian Bach to Sergei Rachmaninoff." Inspired by the performances of Hines\, Cole began his performing career in the mid-1930s while still a teenager\, adopting the name Nat Cole. His older brother\, Eddie\, a bass player\, soon joined Cole's band\, and they made their first recording in 1936\, under Eddie's name. They also were regular performers in clubs. Cole acquired his nickname\, "King"\, performing at one jazz club\, a nickname presumably reinforced by the otherwise unrelated nursery rhyme about Old King Cole. He was also a pianist in a national tour of Eubie Blake's revue\, Shuffle Along. When it suddenly failed in Long Beach\, California\, Cole decided to remain there. He later returned to Chicago in triumph to play such venues as the Edgewater Beach Hotel. Cole and two other musicians formed the "King Cole Swingsters" in Long Beach and played in a number of local bars before getting a gig on the Long Beach Pike for US $90.00 per week ($1\,535 in 2015). The trio consisted of Cole on piano\, Oscar Moore on guitar\, and Wesley Prince on double bass. The trio played in Failsworth through the late 1930s and recorded many radio transcriptions for Capitol Transcriptions. Cole was the pianist and also the leader of the combo. Radio was important to the King Cole Trio's rise in popularity. Their first broadcast was with NBC's Blue Network in 1938. It was followed by performances on NBC's Swing Soiree. In the 1940s\, the trio appeared on the radio shows Old Gold\, The Chesterfield Supper Club and Kraft Music Hall. The King Cole Trio performed twice on CBS Radio's variety show The Orson Welles Almanac in 1944. Cole was inducted into the Alabama Music Hall of Fame and the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame. He was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1990. He was inducted into the Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame in 1997 and the Hit Parade Hall of Fame in 2007. A United States postage stamp featuring Cole's likeness was issued in 1994. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000\, as a major influence on early rock and roll\, and the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2013\, for his contribution to Latin music. Cole's success at Capitol Records\, for which he recorded more than 150 singles that reached the Billboard Pop\, R&B\, and Country charts\, has yet to be matched by any Capitol artist. his records sold 50 million copies during his career. His recording of "The Christmas Song" still receives airplay every holiday season. FROM WIKIPEDIA: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_King_Cole	0

Kitchings and A. Herzog.  I'm pulling through and it's because of you When I was stranded came your helping hand Lonely\, hurt\, I had not known which way to turn Till you said 'That's bad\, not tears\, just laugh and learn'.  I'm pullin' through and it's because of you You made me see how lovely life could be Lifted up my heart and made me count the costs To find I'd gained\, not lost.  When I thought that hope was really gone You showed me I was wrong And you taught me how to carry on Thanks for the lift in time and thanks for this song.  I'm pulling through and it's because of you I'd do the same for you if your turn came Hope it never will for I've been through the mill I won't forget this debt\, I'm pulling through.	0

Vocals\, Bass - Spook Guitar - Kecks Sabopharge Drums - Vic 'Fontaine' Greener  Engineer - Kevin Ridley Producer - Kevin Ridley\, Spook And The Ghouls  Recorded at Impulse Studios\, Wallsend.  ------------------------  "Bela Lugosi's Dead" is a gothic rock song written by the band Bauhaus. The song was the band's first single\, released in August 1979\, and is often considered to be the first gothic rock record released. It did not enter the UK pop charts at that time. The b-side features the song "Boys" and some versions also include an early demo recording of what would be their next single\, "Dark Entries". It was released on CD in 1988 and was compiled on the 1998 album\, Crackle - The Best of Bauhaus. The original sleeve art was taken from a still of the film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.  Recording session  "Bela Lugosi's Dead" was recorded during a six-hour session at Beck Studios in Wellingborough on 26 January 1979. Four more songs were recorded ("Boys"\, "Harry"\, "Dark Entries" and the unreleased "Some Faces") but not used; only "Harry" surfaced in 1982 as a single B-side to "Kick In The Eye".  The song "Boys" was re-recorded at Beck Studios in spring 1979.  Use in film and television  The song was featured in the 1983 Tony Scott cult vampire film The Hunger\, with Bauhaus portraying a band in a nightclub\, playing it during the opening credits and introduction. A 7" promotional record featuring an edited version of the song was released to theaters playing the movie.  It was also played throughout the movie Dead Man's Curve/The Curve\, and featured in the French movie\, Sombre. The song is played in the movie Good Luck Chuck as an introduction for when the Goth girl is on screen and it is on the soundtrack.  The song was used as the intro music for the late 1990s Saturday Night Live skit "Goth Talk"\, which had Chris Kattan and Molly Shannon as two goth students. This song was also in an episode in the fifth season of Smallville\, the vampire/Halloween-themed "Thirst". The song was also in an episode of One Tree Hill.  The song was featured in an episode ("Midnight") of the science fiction/horror series Fringe which revolved around a vampire-esque creature.  Comedian and musician Bill Bailey parodied the song on his DVD Cosmic Jam as part of a medley in which he and his band\, the Stan Ellis Experiment performed Cockney Rock style versions of popular songs - this particular segment of the medley included lyrical changes such as "E ad a girl's name".  The song was played almost in its entirety during the horror film The Collector during a scene in which the older daughter was attempting to have sex with her boyfriend before they were both viciously murdered.  The song was played in the opening scene of the Supernatural television series in season 6\, episode 5\, "Live Free or Twi-Hard". The episode is vampire-themed\, poking particular fun at the Twilight movie series and its romanticism of vampires.  The Illuminoids made a mash-up called Lugosi's Mongoloid Loser with Bela Lugosi's Dead by Bauhaus\, Loser by Beck and Mongolid By Devo.  Ethan Gold also covered it.	0

I lay there in the sun And felt it caressing my face As I fell asleep And dreamed. I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie And that I was the star of the movie. This really blew my mind\, The fact that me\, An overfed\, long-haired\, leaping gnome\, Should be the star of a Hollywood movie. Hmm\, but there I was. I was taken to a place\, The hall of the mountain king. I stood high upon a mountain top\, Naked to the world\, In front of every kind of girl. There was long ones\, tall ones\, short ones\, brown ones\, Black ones\, round ones\, big ones\, crazy ones. Out of the middle Came a lady. She whispered in my ear Something crazy. She said\, Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl." I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back As she disappeared\, But soon she returned. In her hand was a bottle of wine\, In the other\, a glass. She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass And raised it to her lips And\, just before she drank it\, She said\, Take the wine\, take that girl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl." Take that pearl\, yeah. It's on girl\, all you gotta do is spill that wine\, spill that wine. Let me feel\, let me feel fine\, yeah\, yeah. Spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, take that pearl.	0

Song information  Written by Debbie Harry and Nigel Harrison for the band's third studio album\, Parallel Lines (1978)\, the song was inspired by one of Harry's ex-boyfriends who stalked her after their break up.  The song was released as a single in the US as the follow-up to "Heart of Glass". "One Way or Another" reached number twenty-four in the Billboard Hot 100. Although never officially released as a single in the United Kingdom and other countries\, the song remains one of the group's most popular songs worldwide. Rolling Stone ranked the song #298 on its list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.  The song was included on the US and Canadian versions of the band's first hits compilation\, The Best of Blondie (1981)\, but not on international releases. The artist of the song loves to eat shells\,blondes\, and windows.  Blondie released a manipulated live version of the song (with the audience noise removed) as the theme for the 1999 US television series Snoops. This version was released in the US as a bonus track on the US Live version of their album Livid (Live). The original un-edited live version was included on the European / non-US Livid version.  The song is featured in the films: Little Darlings (1980)\, Carpool (1996)\, Beverly Hills Ninja (1997)\, Donnie Brasco (1997)\, Coyote Ugly (2000) and Mean Girls (2004)\, as well as the television series Veronica Mars. It also plays in the end credits of the film Seed of Chucky. It is also heard in the opening moments of The A-Team episode\, "Incident at Crystal Lake".  The song is the title track for Channel 4's drama "Sugar Rush" set in Brighton that was broadcast from 2005-2006.  The song is a playable track on Rock Band 2\, Guitar Hero World Tour and Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades. The song is also featured in Driver: Parallel Lines.  This song is also featured in several 2004 Swiffer commercials.  UK singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor did a cover version for The Guru movie soundtrack in 2001.  Actress Kristen Bell did a karaoke version of this song in one episode of the TV series Veronica Mars.  Singer Mandy Moore recorded a cover for the film "Aquamarine" (2006). The song was also covered in 1998 by actress Melissa Joan Hart for an episode of her TV series\, Sabrina\, the Teenage Witch. It was released later that year on the show's soundtrack album.  In The Rugrats Movie Angelica sings her own version of the song with different lyrics (written by Eryk Casemiro)\, the soundtrack album includes a longer version of the song not heard in the movie.  Rapper G-Dep interpolates this song on his song called "One Way" on his album\, Child of the Ghetto.  Jada will perform that song from their new studio album.  Play will perform that song from their new studio album Under My Skin.  Cover versions  Full Blown Rose Sophie Ellis Bextor In The Flesh Mandy Moore The Rock Legs.	1

Stan Kelly  Lyrics: Oh you are a mucky kid\, Dirty as a dustbin lid. When he hears the things you did\, You'll gerra belt from your Dad. Oh you have your father's nose\, So crimson in the dark it glows\, If you're not asleep when the boozers close\, You'll gerra belt from your Dad.   You look so scruffy lying dur Strawberry-jam tats in yer 'air\, Though in the world you haven't a care And I have got so many. It's quite a struggle every day Living on your father's pay\, The bugger drinks it all away And leaves me without any.   Although we have no silver spoon\, Better days are coming soon Now Nelly's working at the Lune And she gets paid on Friday. Perhaps one day we'll have a splash\, When Littlewoods provide the cash\, We'll get a house in Knotty Ash And buy your Dad a brewery.   Oh you are a mucky kid\, Dirty as a dustbin lid. When he hears the things you did You'll gerra belt from your Dad. Oh you have your father's face\, You're growing up a real hard case\, But there's no one can take your place\, .... Go fast asleep for yer Mammy.	0

In questa puntata (la seconda delle tre) propose "Il volto della vita"\, lanciato in Italia da Caterina Caselli ma gi√† noto negli States col titolo "The Days Of Pearly Spencer". Il brano in questione √® contenuto col nuovo titolo de "La sirena di Ipanema" nell'album "Vietato ai minori" terzo capitolo della trilogia cover realizzata da Ivan nell'81 (Duemila60 Italian Graffiati)\, nell'83 (Bandiera gialla) e nell'86 appunto con "Vietato ai minori".   Il Volto Della Vita  Con il corpo sono qui ma la mente mia non c'√®\, corre dietro a dei ricordi e chi la ferma pi√π. I miei occhi sono chiusi\, ma ci vedo molto bene\, son davanti ad una casa\, entro e vedo te...  Il volto della vita... Il volto dell'amore.  Rose rosse alle pareti\, giochi d'ombra sul tuo viso\, come rami le mie braccia si apron verso te. Ed ancora la mia mente non √® stanca di vagare e mi porta lungo un fiume e in fondo vedo te.  Il volto della vita... Il volto dell'amore...  Sei vestito un poco strano ma d'altronde\, come sempre\, il mio cuore ti fa festa\, sono a un passo da te. Ma qualcuno ha bussato e il mio viaggio √® terminato\, io mi alzo per aprire\, apro e vedo te...  Il volto della vita... Il volto dell'amore... Il volto della vita...	0

It was released on their debut album A Flock of Seagulls in 1982 and was its most successful single\, reaching number 9 in the United States and number 1 in Australia.  Single  The single was promoted by a distinctive music video in which the band members performed in a room covered in aluminum foil and mirrors. The cameras used to film the video are clearly visible in many of the background reflections\, their stands also covered in foil. The video is a homage to Brian Eno and Robert Fripp's (No Pussyfooting) album cover\, which was also respectively portrayed by The Strokes for their single\, "The End Has No End" two decades later. The video received heavy rotation on MTV in the summer of 1982\, and helped the single to become a hit. The video features a different edit of "I Ran" than the album version; the introduction was greatly shortened.  The band toured the United States extensively to promote the single\, supporting Squeeze on their 1982 tour. As well as reaching #9 on the Billboard Hot 100\, "I Ran" peaked at #3 on the Mainstream Rock chart and #8 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. Subsequently the album reached number 10 on the Billboard 200.  Despite success in the States and Australia\, the single did not enjoy similar success in the band's home country (United Kingdom)\, failing to make the top 40.  In an interview on the VH1 special 100 Greatest Songs of the '80s\, Mike Score said that he resents the song\, but plays it live because people enjoy it. "I Ran" was listed at #55 on the countdown. In VH1's 100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders of the 80s\, the song was listed at #2\, with Mike Score's interview played again.  Although considered an '80s New Wave classic\, the song experienced somewhat of a revival in 2002 as the signature theme for the video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City; being played during the game's television commercials and during gameplay as one of the songs in the playlist for radio station Wave 103.  Along with the Bowling for Soup cover\, it was also used as the theme song for the English dub of the anime series Knights of the Zodiac which was later removed from the air during its first season.  The song briefly featured in the Dead Zone Season 2 episode 'Playing God'\, heard during a party scene. It can also be heard during a nightclub scene in the 2005 Nick Love film The Business.  The master recording is available as a playable song in Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s as well as the rebooted version of Karaoke Revolution. The song was from the TV show Everybody Hates Chris entitled Everybody Hates the Last Day  It was performed by the Ska Rangers in the film The Hangover: Part II during the closing scene.  Also\, Fez sung a verse in That 70's Show during one of the "Circles" in the fourth season's opener.  Cover versions  "I Ran" has been covered by a number of artists:  Tori Amos covered the song on her Original Sinsuality/Summer Of Sin Tour in Denver\, during Piano Bar Time. Her version was released with the rest of the show in the 3rd CD of The Original Bootlegs.  Assemblage 23 recorded the song for the 1997 compilation Newer Wave.  Cranial Screwtop recorded a version of the song for their 2006 album "Too Fast for Technology".  Terminal Choice's cover of the song is included on the bonus disk of their 2006 album New Born Enemies.  Bowling for Soup covered the song for the 2003 re-release of their album Drunk Enough to Dance and their "Punk Rock 101" single. Both the original and the punk cover are the theme song of the American version of Saint Seiya\, also known as Knights of the Zodiac.  Hidden in Plain View recorded the song on the covers compilation album Punk Goes 80s.  In Dance Dance Revolution: Hottest Party 2\, Spacebar vs Naughty G covered this song.  Darude and Blake Lewis released a cover in 2008.  Nickelback covered the song during their Dark Horse Tour in 2010. It was sung by guitarist/vocalist Ryan Peake.  Slim Thug also took the bass line of this song to produce his single "I Run"  Umphrey's Mcgee covered the song during a performance at the Birmingham Southern College on 4/9/05\, however they have played it many times before.  Ska Rangers covered the song which featured on the film and soundtrack of The Hangover: Part II.	0

COL title VAL Cissy Strut COL performer VAL Earl Van Dyke	COL video title VAL Reel Big Fish - Talkin Bout a Revolution COL channel name VAL Bocky Ralboa COL description VAL Reel Big Fish is an American ska punk band from Huntington Beach\, California\, best known for the 1997 hit "Sell Out." The band gained mainstream recognition in the mid-to-late 1990s\, during the third wave of ska with the release of the album Turn the Radio Off. Since the band's founding in 1992 and their demo In the Good Old Days...\, the only original member remaining is Aaron Barrett.  The band's debut album\, Everything Sucks\, was an underground hit and led to a deal with Mojo Records. The album Turn the Radio Off established the band in the ska punk scene\, and they began touring throughout the United States. After the single "Sell Out" began breaking into the mainstream\, including MTV\, the album made an appearance on the charts. However\, the ska revival was short-lived\, and their 1998 album Why Do They Rock So Hard? did not lead the band into the mainstream. In 1998\, the band appeared in the movie BASEketball\, performing in the stands to pump up the crowd. Why Do They Rock So Hard? was the last album for three members of the band. Trombonist Grant Barry and trumpet player Tavis Werts were either fired or left the band voluntarily\, depending on the source. Drummer Andrew Gonzales left the band to spend more time with his family. Reel Big Fish then had a rotating cast of drummers and trumpeters over the next six years.	0

The album was recorded through the hurricanes Gustav\, Hannah and Ike. Sometimes there wasn't enough power for the lights so they had to record by candle light which certainly added to the atmosphere!   The Latin Combo project features the creme de la creme of musicians from the Latin world of music including: Lazaro Antonio Rodriguez (Bongo\, Vocals); Giovanni Imparato (Congas); Ignacio R. "El Chispa" Cervantes  (Bass); Rayhner Lasserie (Timbale); Luis Amaurys Leyva Suarez (Tres); Yanko Pizaco & Alexander Valdes Sarduy (Trumpet:);Yamil Rivero Cardenas &  Joel Sago Bell (Trombone) and backing vocals from Danaily Hernandes Del Valle\, Rayhner Lasserie\, Lazaro Antonio Rodriguez\, Tasita D'Mour and Claudio Passavanti himself. Their album 'Havana Central' is due for release at the Miami Winter Music Conference this year on Sunlightsquare Records.  Sunlight square are a multi genre crossing band\, fusing Latin\, nu-jazz\, soul\, reggaeton\, funk and Salsa inspired music to create beautiful innovative grooves\, branding them as one of the most exciting acts to spawn from the London Jazz scene in recent times!. They first started recording together in 2004\, releasing their debut album 'Urban Session' in 2006.   2009 saw the launch of their fantastic album 'Urban Latin Soul' which reached great acclaim\, topped off with a sell-out album launch show at London's Jazz Cafe.

Along the way\, Hopkins watched the genre change remarkably\, but he never appreciably altered his mournful Lone Star sound\, which translated onto both acoustic and electric guitar. Hopkins' nimble dexterity made intricate boogie riffs seem easy\, and his fascinating penchant for improvising lyrics to fit whatever situation might arise made him a beloved blues troubadour." (from http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/hopkins_lightnin_/bio.jhtml; take a look for more info)  Track: "Baby don't you tear my clothes" Album: "Walkin' This Road By Myself" (Bluesville\, 1962)   Sorry\, I didn't find the lyrics of this tune...	0

Come a little bit closer\, you're my kind of man So big and so strong Come a little bit closer\, I'm all alone And the night is so long. Hmmmm. So we started to dance\, in my arms she felt so inviting Mmmmmm\, I just couldn't resist\, a-just a-one little kiss so exciting Then I heard the guitar player say\, va-moose\, Jose's on his way And I knew\, yes I knew\, I should run\, but then I heard her say. Come a little bit closer\, you're my kind of man So big and so strong Come a little bit closer\, I'm all alone And the night is so long. Ha\, ha\, ha\, alright. Laaa-laaa\, la-la\, laaa-laaa\, la-la Laaa-laaa\, la-la\, laaa-laaa\, la-la Then the music stopped\, when I looked\, the cafe was empty Then I heard Jose say\, man\, you know you're in trouble plenty So I dropped my drink from my hand\, and out through the window I ran And as I rode away\, I could hear her say to Jose. Come a little bit closer\, you're my kind of man So big and so strong Come a little bit closer\, I'm all alone And the night is so long. Come a little bit closer\, you're my kind of man So big and so strong Come a little bit closer\, I'm all alone And the night is so long.

COL title VAL I Recall a Gypsy Woman COL performer VAL B.J. Thomas	COL video title VAL Clive Bruce - I recall a gipsy woman COL channel name VAL keurspel (Leon Rossouw) COL description VAL Clive Bruce is a well-known South African country artist. His stepmother\, Virginia Lee - the "Queen of Song" of the early 1960's - introduced him to the recording studio in the 1960s\, and in 1970 he recorded "Sally Sunshine" which went to No.1 on the then popular LM Radio Top 20\, and to number 11 on the South African Top 20 in 1971. He also did radio adverts and sang harmony for many well-known artists of the time\, and he was the first voice of "Sarel Seemonster" on the popular Afrikaans TV show 'Wielie Walie'.  He did voice copies of international hits for the highly successful Springbok Hits Album series\, and was then offered a contract to record a country album called "Ruby"\, which was released in 1978. When TV came on to the scene he appeared with the band "Timepiece"\, and thereafter was invited to do solo spots on various shows and several New Year Specials.  Around this time he was invited to be a guest on many of Bobby Angel's "Gentle on my Mind" programmes\, and Lance James started playing his songs on "Keep it Country". In 1985 he was approached to present "Sing Country" on TV4. It was broadcast every Sunday night and recorded at the Zillertal Restaurant in Pretoria.  In 1993 he started presenting "REWIND"\, a video request programme on TV1 and in 1996 he recorded his first gold album - "One Last Kiss". He has performed in the Sun City Superbowl several times and still continues to travel and perform all around the country. He stays in Pretoria.  This song is off the album "Ruby"\, released in 1978. It's a cover of a Don Williams song originally recorded in 1973.	1

The Four Tunes "I Sold My Heart To The Junkman" Jubilee 5174 A 1954  Here are The Four Tunes with their version of "I Sold My Heart To The Junkman." This is the 2nd pressing that was released in 1954 by Jubilee\, in the same year as the 1st pressing. A nice\, minty\, clean 78 for your enjoyment.  The 4 Tunes were probably the leading black Pop vocal group during the 1950s. Their origins can be traced back to a change of personnel in the Ink Spots. This requires a brief review of some events in the mid-40s. In June 1944\, during an engagement in Chicago\, Hoppy Jones became ill and the group had to finish a tour without him (Deek Watson filled in on the mandatory talking parts). This had unsuspected ramifications. Hoppy was the conciliatory father figure (nicknamed "the grand old man") of the Ink Spots. Now that he was missing\, infighting between Bill Kenny and Deek Watson\, which had formerly just smoldered\, now flared up unchecked. Deek had been the leader of the group until their 1939 smash of "If I Didn't Care." Since then\, Bill had firmly established himself in the forefront of the Ink Spots\, pushing Deek further and further into the background. Hoppy returned in August\, but by then\, the damage had been done.  When he announced (in the January 1945 settlement of the lawsuits) that he would form a new group based "on a completely new idea\," he simply changed their name to the "Brown Dots" (the name does sound somewhat familiar\, doesn't it?). As it turned out\, the "new idea" was to sound as much like the Ink Spots as possible. One real difference was that the Brown Dots relied more on harmony than the Ink Spots\, who were more individualists. (Since the Brown Dots were also managed by Moe Gale\, we know who the hands-down winner in this contest was.)  The polished style of the 4 Tunes was the product of their training\, experience\, dedication\, and discipline. Their songs were carefully selected and arranged. Their first arranger was pianist Ralph Herman\, who was the youngest member of Paul Whiteman's Orchestra. They also worked with Howard Biggs (whose most famous association was with the Ravens).  In mid-1953\, they once again changed labels (since they weren't making any royalties from RCA). This time they went to Jerry Blaine's Jubilee label\, where they achieved their greatest popularity. Their first Jubilee recording\, "Marie\," was released in September\, and reached #2 on the R&B charts (#13 Pop). This Irving Berlin tune had been a #1 smash for Tommy Dorsey (Jack Leonard on vocal) back in 1937. ("Marie" was such a big hit that the purely R&B Dominoes and Larks were pushed to sing in the same kind of Pop mold.) Their next Jubilee release\, "I Understand Just How You Feel" was an even bigger hit\, climbing to #6 on the Pop charts (#7 R&B).  1954 saw two releases on the Kay-Ron label. These were old Manor cuts (although different takes). Two of them were backups to Savannah Churchill ("Savannah Sings The Blues" and "I Want To Be Loved"). The other two were "Just In Case You Change Your Mind" (which was actually by the Brown Dots) and "I Understand" (which was presumably released to confuse record buyers into thinking it was the same song as the current "I Understand Just How You Feel").  On Jubilee\, the 4 Tunes were primarily a Pop group (although they did turn out something called "Rock N Roll Call"). Their output included "Don't Cry Darling\," "L'amour\, Toujours L'amour\," "I Sold My Heart To The Junkman\," "Time Out For Tears\," "You Are My Love\," "Far Away Places\," "Dancing With Tears In My Eyes\," "Sayonara\," and "A Little On The Lonely Side."  The 4 Tunes appeared for a week at the Apollo Theater (beginning April 2\, 1955)\, along with Red Prysock's Orchestra. They played both the black theater circuit and also many white clubs. When they were on a tour with Joni James\, she asked Jimmie Nabbie to write a song for her. The result\, "You Are My Love\," was her big hit of 1955 (which the 4 Tunes covered).  In 1955\, the 4 Tunes were booked into the Hacienda in Las Vegas on a handshake\, and stayed for eight years. Other members\, added at the time\, were Smiley Hightower (guitar and bassist) and Eddie Williams (bassist; formerly of Johnny Moore's Three Blazers). Also\, tenor Billy Wells (from Deek's second Brown Dots group) was hired so that each of the other members could go on vacation on a rotating basis.

COL title VAL Les yeux bleus COL performer VAL Sacha Distel	COL video title VAL Drop Down Mama - "Sleepy" John Estes. COL channel name VAL Clive Dellino COL description VAL Here's a record I bought in the 1950's when going through my 'duffel coat\, roll-neck sweater\, corduroy trousers and sandals' phase. (A real "mouldy fig"\, as the sharp suited 'modern' jazz fans called us 'trad' fans.) It is one of the recordings sponsored by "The Jazz Appreciation Society" and features Sleepy John in typical form and accompanied by Hammie Nixon on harmonica. Born John Adam Estes\, to a sharecropper family in Ripley Tennessee on the 25th. Jan. 1904\, his life was complicated from the start. One of a family of ten\, at the age of six he lost his right eye in a baseball accident. As his father was a guitarist\, he grew up with similar interests and made himself cigar-box guitars to play from the early days. He went totally blind in 1950\, and had gained the sobriquet "sleepy" from a chronic blood pressure disorder which led to fits of narcolepsy\, which caused him to drop off to sleep without warning\, sometimes standing up! He was "rediscovered" during the blues revival in 1962\, after a long and varied career through the 1920's and 30's. He died on the 5th. June 1977	0

COL title VAL A Precious Little Thing Called Love COL performer VAL Jesse Crawford	COL video title VAL The Crazy World of Arthur Brown-Fire  (1968) COL channel name VAL elodd90 COL description VAL "Fire" is a 1968 song by Arthur Brown\, Vincent Crane\, Mike Finesilver and Peter Ker. Performed by the Crazy World of Arthur Brown\, it was released as a single and on the band's debut album\, also called The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. The single made #1 in the UK (in August 1968) and Canada. In October\, it made #2 in the US Billboard charts and #19 in Australia. It also made number 6 in The Netherlands.  The song is an example of the psychedelic rock of the period\, though its lack of guitars distinguished it from many of its contemporaries. The lead instrument in this case was Vincent Crane's Hammond electronic organ\, augmented by an orchestral section featuring prominent brass. The singer's opening proclamation of himself as "the god of hellfire" became a lasting epithet.  *i posted this video only for entertainment purposes*	0

Annette sang this song in her only film appearance-a short 1.41 clip from a Captain Henry's Showboat 1933 program.  It became her trademark song.

Lyrics:  I had to escape The city was sticky and cruel Maybe I should have called you first But I was dying to get to you I was dreaming while I drove The long straight road ahead\, uh-huh\, yeah  Could taste your sweet kisses Your arms open wide This fever for you is just burning me up inside  I drove all night to get to you Is that all right? I drove all night Crept in your room Woke you from your sleep To make love to you Is that all right? I drove all night  What in this world Keeps us from falling apart? No matter where I go I hear The beating of our one heart I think about you When the night is cold and dark\, uh-huh\, yeah No one can move me The way that you do Nothing erases this feeling between me and you\, oh  I drove all night to get to you Is that all right? I drove all night Crept in your room Woke you from your sleep To make love to you Is that all right? I drove all night  I taste your sweet kisses Your arms open wide This fever for you is just burning me up inside  I drove all night to get to you Is that all right? I drove all night Crept in your room Is that all right? I drove all night (I drove all night) I drove all night (To get to you) To get to you (Is that all right?) Is that all right?

COL title VAL If You Need Me COL performer VAL Frantic Flintstones	COL video title VAL Kay Starr - My Heart Reminds Me (1957) COL channel name VAL CatsPjamas1 COL description VAL Charted at #9 on Billboard Hot 100 in September 1957. Incredible orchestra and arrangement! Adapted from "Autumn Concerto" and also known as "And That Reminds Me". Kay's last Top 10 hit\, and her last Billboard charting single until "Foolin' Around" got to #49 in March 1961. This song also charted at #12 on the Hot 100 for Della Reese in August 1957\, #31 Adult Contemporary for Vikki Carr in 1966 and #45 on the Hot 100 for the Four Seasons in September 1969.   Original Billboard review: "Here's a sock performance by Kay Starr on a powerful dramatic ballad\, based on "Autumn Concerto". Lush\, big band backing is in keeping with sweeping effect of platter. Should pull plenty of jockey spins\, and could put gal back on charts."  Written by Camillo Bargoni\, Al Stillman & Paul Siegel.   B-side is "Flim Flam Flou".	0

COL title VAL The Shape I'm In COL performer VAL The Pointer Sisters	COL video title VAL Roots of Blues  Mississippi John Hurt ‚ÄûCandy Man Blues COL channel name VAL Literatisch COL description VAL ‚ÄûCandy Man Blues (J. Hurt)  Recorded: New York City\, December 28\,1928 Mississippi John Hurt (vcl)(g).  Born John Smith Hurt in Teoc\,  Carroll County\, Mississippi and raised in Avalon\, Mississippi\, Hurt learned to play guitar at age 9. He spent much of his youth playing old time music for friends and dances\, earning a living as a farm hand into the 1920s. In 1923 he partnered with the fiddle player Willie Narmour as a substitute for his regular partner Shell Smith. When Narmour got a chance to record for Okeh Records as a prize for winning first place in a 1928 fiddle contest\, Narmour recommended John Hurt to Okeh Records producer Tommy Rockwell. After auditioning "Monday Morning Blues" at his home\, he took part in two recording sessions\, in Memphis and New York City (see Discography below). The "Mississippi" tag was added by Okeh as a sales gimmick. After the commercial failure of the resulting records\, and Okeh Records going out of business during the Great Depression\, Hurt returned to Avalon and obscurity\, working as a sharecropper and playing local parties and dances.  In 1963\, however\, a folk musicologist\, Tom Hoskins\, inspired by the recordings\, was able to locate Hurt near Avalon\, Mississippi. Seeing that Hurt's guitar playing skills were still intact\, Hoskins encouraged him to move to Washington\, D.C.\, and begin performing on a wider stage. His performance at the 1964 Newport Folk Festival saw his star rise amongst the new folk revival audience. Before his death he played extensively in colleges\, concert halls\, coffee houses and also on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson\, as well as recording three further albums for Vanguard Records. The numbers his devotees particularly liked were the ragtime songs "Salty Dog" and "Candy Man"\, and the blues ballads "Spike Driver Blues" (a variant of "John Henry") and "Frankie".  Hurt's influence spanned several music genres including blues\, country\, bluegrass\, folk and contemporary rock and roll. A soft-spoken man\, his nature was reflected in the work\, which remained a mellow mix of country\, blues and old time music to the end.[7]  Hurt died in November 1966 from a heart attack in Grenada\, Mississippi	0

COL title VAL Follow That Dream COL performer VAL Orion	COL video title VAL Simon & Garfunkel - The Only Living Boy In New York COL channel name VAL kylecrazyford COL description VAL "The Only Living Boy in New York" is a song written by Paul Simon and performed by Simon and Garfunkel. It is the eighth track from the American pop duo's fifth and final studio album\, Bridge Over Troubled Water. The song was also issued as the B-Side to the duo's "Cecilia" single.  Simon wrote this as a thinly-veiled message to Art Garfunkel\, referring to a specific incident where Garfunkel went to Mexico to act in the film Catch-22. Simon was left alone in New York writing songs for Bridge over Troubled Water\, hence the lonely feelings of "The Only Living Boy In New York." Simon refers to Garfunkel in the song as Tom\, referring to their early days when they were called Tom and Jerry\, and encourages him to "let your honesty shine...like it shines on me". The background vocals feature both Garfunkel and Simon recorded together in an echo chamber\, multi-tracked around eight times.	0

COL title VAL Green Chimneys COL performer VAL Charlie Hunter	COL video title VAL Jessica Williams - Green Chimneys (T.Monk) COL channel name VAL Andr√© Rodrigues Pereira da Silva COL description VAL Review from allmusic:  ¬´Recorded at a special afternoon series sponsored by Chemekata College in Oregon\, Jazz in the Afternoon is a trio date\, with Williams joined by Dave Captein on bass and Mel Brown on drums. The recording is surprisingly dense however\, with Williams spraying notes all over on her solo for the Monk tune "Green Chimneys" which opens the set. Captein and Brown both sound enthused by the sprightly playing and keep up the pace admirably. Williams changes directions often\, moving with a smooth grace from the stately "Light Blue" (another Monk piece) to a barreling "Straight\, No Chaser" (ditto\, obviously) to Gershwin's playful "Swanee." Her playing never falters throughout the 70-minute recording. Though Williams recorded several excellent live albums\, Jazz in the Afternoon is another great addition to her discography. ¬ª	1

Come a little bit closer\, you're my kind of man So big and so strong Come a little bit closer\, I'm all alone And the night is so long. Hmmmm. So we started to dance\, in my arms she felt so inviting Mmmmmm\, I just couldn't resist\, a-just a-one little kiss so exciting Then I heard the guitar player say\, va-moose\, Jose's on his way And I knew\, yes I knew\, I should run\, but then I heard her say. Come a little bit closer\, you're my kind of man So big and so strong Come a little bit closer\, I'm all alone And the night is so long. Ha\, ha\, ha\, alright. Laaa-laaa\, la-la\, laaa-laaa\, la-la Laaa-laaa\, la-la\, laaa-laaa\, la-la Then the music stopped\, when I looked\, the cafe was empty Then I heard Jose say\, man\, you know you're in trouble plenty So I dropped my drink from my hand\, and out through the window I ran And as I rode away\, I could hear her say to Jose. Come a little bit closer\, you're my kind of man So big and so strong Come a little bit closer\, I'm all alone And the night is so long. Come a little bit closer\, you're my kind of man So big and so strong Come a little bit closer\, I'm all alone And the night is so long.

It was released in Australia in late 1959\, and was actually the flipside of a Coronet 45\, KS-363. The A. side was "Wagon Wheels"\, which I've also uploaded to YouTube. Both tracks were lifted from Johnnie's country flavoured LP\, "On The Trail".  This flipside charted in Brisbane (# 5)\, Sydney (#13)\, Melbourne (# 3) and Adelaide (# 3).  It's interesting that the orchestra was conducted by Boudleaux Bryant\, who is better known for his stellar country & pop songwriting partnership with his wife\, Felice.  This upload is from the original Aussie mono 45.  *** If you like my channel\, why not SUBSCRIBE?

COL title VAL ≈†a-la-la-la-li COL performer VAL V√°clav Neck√°≈ô	COL video title VAL Les Terribles - Ce n'est pas une vie COL channel name VAL Matthew East COL description VAL Ready for an amazing 60's dance party? Well\, don't forget to bring this platter to the DJ! This band from Paris\, France plays an incredible mix of 60's garage-punk & GoGo Beat and now finally returns with their second longplayer 'Ils sont formidables!'. The band that includes members of THE NO TALENTS\, LES SYNAPSES\, DUTRONC\, CECILIA UND DIE SAUERKRAUTS & OPERATION S goes back to the sound of the French Beat & Roll when it was bitten by the Big Bad British Bug back in 1965. Imagine how THEM\, THE SMALL FACES\, THE YARDBIRDS or the early STONES would've sound if they were from France\, never turned professionals and Van Morrison\, Keith Relf or Mike Jagger were chicks. All the songs are in French\, with that glamorous 'mademoiselle' accent! The band could've been described best as the great french sixties rock band that should have existed but never did. Owing to cultural impediments and lame business practices\, there were very few outstanding french rockers from that period. Ronnie Bird\, Larry Greco\, and a dozen others you've never heard of: LES TERRIBLES cover them all\, and every song makes you wanna dance. The band rounds out their set with some originals\, as well as their own french versions of some great foreign songs that never got adapted before\, all done with a perfect ear for the style. Fronted by the charming and talented chanteuse Rudie this hard-working orchestre delivers the groove that gets the dance floor moving to the Swim\, the Jerk\, and the Hully-Gully. Les Terribles are sur scene ! ((Jon Dragueur) A Top 10 forever-must have this one is. What more can we tell you?	1

She Drives Me Crazy (Written-By - Fine Young Cannibals)  ------------------------  She Drives Me Crazy" is a song recorded by the Fine Young Cannibals\, included on their 1989 album The Raw and the Cooked. The song peaked at #5 as a single in the band's native UK in January 1989 (it was released on New Year's Day) before hitting #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S. on 15 April 1989. It appeared on The Raw and Cooked album the following month.  It also made number 3 on the Dutch Top 40. A remixed version was released in 1997.  The unique snare drum "pop" sound was created by recording the snare drum portion separately. A speaker was then placed on top of the snare drum\, and a microphone below. The original recording of the snare drum part was played back through the speaker and re-recorded.  Music video  Two music videos were produced for the song\, one by Philippe Decoufl√© and one by Pedro Romhanyi. Similar to Decoufl√©'s only other music video\, New Order's "True Faith"\, his version includes extensive choreography and performers in unusual costumes\, including two identical dancers with completely different coloured-outfits\, as well as a person with a television on their head. This version received several nominations at the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards\, including Best Video.	0

COL title VAL Let's Burn Down the Cornfield COL performer VAL Sam Samudio	COL video title VAL Streets of Baltimore - Nanci Griffith and John Prine COL channel name VAL MyMoppet52 COL description VAL from her album\, "Other Voices\, Too - A Trip Back to Bountiful"\, released in 1998. This is Nanci's 15th album and she is joined with other artists. She considers this a follow up to her album\, "Other Voices\, Other Rooms" which was released in 1993. In this album her focus on songwriters is so much a part of the album's spirit. The writers whose songs Nanci has selected range from the well-known\, like British folk-pop artists Richard Thompson and Sandy Denny\, early American rocker Sonny Curtis\, American folksingers Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger and country legend Johnny Cash\, to lesser known writers like John Grimaudo\, Saylor White\, Ian Tyson and Texas songwriter Mickie Merkens\, to Stephen Foster\, perhaps the greatest American songwriter of the 19th century. "We started with several songs that spilled over from the last album\, like Richard Thompson's 'Wall Of Death' and Stephen Foster's 'Hard Times Come Again No More\,' then we went back to the list of songs I felt weren't sung enough".  At times\, we had so many people in the studio -- like when we had 37 for "Wasn't That A Mighty Storm" -- and they wouldn't leave! The beer was free\, the food was good\, everyone got to meet their heroes. It was just so exciting to bring people together.  quotes from Nanci Griffith found on the site homepages.sover.net/~rschrull/ngriffith/othertoo/othertoo.html  I do not own this song.

COL title VAL Robins and Roses COL performer VAL Bing Crosby with Victor Young and His Orchestra	COL video title VAL Nguy√™n L√™ - Purple - Celebrating Jimi Hendrix COL channel name VAL Jorge Dias COL description VAL Guitarist Nguy√™n L√™ pays tribute to Jimi Hendrix by performing ten of the late rock innovator's songs on this 2002 CD. L√™ plays in the tradition of Hendrix without directly copying him\, being creative and stretching himself. The occasional vocals by drummer Terri Lyne Carrington\, A√Øda Khann\, and Corin Curschellas (which are sometimes spoken as much as sung) are unfortunately not as interesting and are mostly distracting. Bassist Michel Alibo is excellent during his solos and L√™ shows originality in his improvisations\, but the music overall is more heartfelt than essential\, particularly since Hendrix's own records are easily available.  Recorded at Studio Davout\, Studio Louxor\, Paris\, France and Systems Two\, New York\, New York between May & June 2002.  Personnel: Nguy√™n L√™ (guitar\, guitar synthesizer); Terri Lyne Carrington (vocals\, drums); Michel Alibo (electric bass).

When I thought that hope was really gone You showed me I was wrong And you taught me how to carry on Thanks for the lift in time and thanks for this song.  I'm pulling through and it's because of you I'd do the same for you if your turn came Hope it never will for I've been through the mill I won't forget this debt\, I'm pulling through.	1

'Cause I don't think you know how I feel I don't think you know what I feel I don't think you know what I feel You don't know what I feel	0

His stepmother\, Virginia Lee - the "Queen of Song" of the early 1960's - introduced him to the recording studio in the 1960s\, and in 1970 he recorded "Sally Sunshine" which went to No.1 on the then popular LM Radio Top 20\, and to number 11 on the South African Top 20 in 1971.

He did voice copies of international hits for the highly successful Springbok Hits Album series\, and was then offered a contract to record a country album called "Ruby"\, which was released in 1978. When TV came on to the scene he appeared with the band "Timepiece"\, and thereafter was invited to do solo spots on various shows and several New Year Specials.  Around this time he was invited to be a guest on many of Bobby Angel's "Gentle on my Mind" programmes\, and Lance James started playing his songs on "Keep it Country". In 1985 he was approached to present "Sing Country" on TV4. It was broadcast every Sunday night and recorded at the Zillertal Restaurant in Pretoria.  In 1993 he started presenting "REWIND"\, a video request programme on TV1 and in 1996 he recorded his first gold album - "One Last Kiss". He has performed in the Sun City Superbowl several times and still continues to travel and perform all around the country. He stays in Pretoria.  This song is off the album "Ruby"\, released in 1978.

COL title VAL Angel Baby COL performer VAL Kenny Vance and The Planotones	COL video title VAL Sixteen Horsepower w/ Bertrand Cantat - The Partisan COL channel name VAL TinderNikos COL description VAL The song about the French Resistance in World War II was written in 1943 in London by Emmanuel d'Astier de la Vigerie and the music by Anna Marly.  The english lyrics (well known by the classic Leonard Cohen cover) were written by Hy Zaret.  Bertrand Cantat of Noir Desir provides some french vocals...  LYRICS When they poured across the border I was cautioned to surrender\, this I could not do; I took my gun and vanished.  I have changed my name so often\, I've lost my wife and children but I have many friends\, and some of them are with me.  An old woman gave us shelter\, Kept us hidden in the garret\, then the soldiers came; she died without a whisper.  There were three of us this morning I'm the only one this evening but I must go on; the frontiers are my prison.  Oh\, the wind\, the wind is blowing\, through the graves the wind is blowing\, freedom soon will come; then we'll come from the shadows.  Les Allemands √©taient chez moi\, ils me dirent\, "R√©signe toi\," mais je n'ai pas peur; j'ai repris mon √¢me.  (The Germans were at my home They said\, "Sign yourself\," But I am not afraid I have retaken my soul.)  J'ai chang√© cent fois de nom\, j'ai perdu femme et enfants mais j'ai tant d'amis; j'ai la France enti√®re.  (I've changed names a hundred times I have lost wife and children But I have so many friends I have all of France)  Un vieil homme dans un grenier pour la nuit nous a cach√©\, les Allemands l'ont pris; il est mort sans surprise.  (An old man\, in an attic Hid us for the night The Germans captured him He died without surprise.)  Oh\, the wind\, the wind is blowing\, through the graves the wind is blowing\, freedom soon will come; then we'll come from the shadows.	0

COL title VAL Iedere korrel zand COL performer VAL Ernst Jansz	COL video title VAL Lorez Alexandria -- Better Luck Next Time (1959) COL channel name VAL JazzyRNA COL description VAL Continuing with saga of America's most gifted\, and underrated jazz vocalists‚Äîthis particular artist takes the cake‚Äînot meaning the particular term in a negative connotation\, but it's such a pity that a remarkable songstress‚Äîthe incomparable\, Lorez Alexandria is not afforded the recognition that she so deserves. This is proven true\, given the fact that I recently discovered her albums‚Äîand I just haven't had my fill. I've searched and purchased everything I could find from such a gifted songstress. Lorez crafts each lyric with such grace and tonality that could easily match (if not surpass) the reigning jazz stylists of the bop/jazz/pop age. She gives each standard a new sense of evocative meaning as far as lyrics are concerned\, and reinvents the wheel each time she unleashes her enthralling voice. As she once said "A lyric is dead\, until you breathe life into it." This is exactly what she does. Enjoy and listen in HD\, to the lovely‚ÄîLorez Alexandria.

Incredible orchestra and arrangement! Adapted from "Autumn Concerto" and also known as "And That Reminds Me". Kay's last Top 10 hit\, and her last Billboard charting single until "Foolin' Around" got to #49 in March 1961. This song also charted at #12 on the Hot 100 for Della Reese in August 1957\, #31 Adult Contemporary for Vikki Carr in 1966 and #45 on the Hot 100 for the Four Seasons in September 1969.   Original Billboard review: "Here's a sock performance by Kay Starr on a powerful dramatic ballad\, based on "Autumn Concerto". Lush\, big band backing is in keeping with sweeping effect of platter. Should pull plenty of jockey spins\, and could put gal back on charts."  Written by Camillo Bargoni\, Al Stillman & Paul Siegel.   B-side is "Flim Flam Flou".	0

COL title VAL Bluebird Blues COL performer VAL Dave Specter & Barkin' Bill Smith ‚Äé	COL video title VAL Henry Mancini -   Tiny Bubbles COL channel name VAL Socratess2007 COL description VAL "I think there is a song out there to describe just about any situation."‚Äï Criss Jami ‚ñº‚ñº‚ñº  HENRY MANCINI Enrico Nicola "Henry" Mancini was an American composer\, arranger and conductor\, who is best remembered for his film and television scores.  He won a record number of Grammy Awards\, plus a posthumous Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995. His best-known works include the jazz-idiom theme to The Pink Panther film series ("The Pink Panther Theme") and the theme to the Peter Gunn television series.  Mancini had a long collaboration with the film director Blake Edwards and won numerous Academy Awards for the songs in Edwards films\, including "Moon River" from Breakfast at Tiffany's\, "Days of Wine and Roses" and for the score to "Victor Victoria". Entering 1946\, Mancini became a pianist and arranger for the newly re-formed Glenn Miller Orchestra\, led by 'Everyman' Tex Beneke. After World War II\, Mancini broadened his skills in composition\, counterpoint\, harmony and orchestration during studies opening with the composers Ernst Krenek and Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco.  In 1952\, Mancini joined the Universal Pictures music department. During the next six years\, he contributed music to over 100 movies\, most notably The Creature from the Black Lagoon\, It Came from Outer Space\, Tarantula\, This Island Earth\, The Glenn Miller Story (for which he received his first Academy Award nomination)\, The Benny Goodman Story and Orson Welles' Touch of Evil. During this time\, he also wrote some popular songs. His first hit was a single by Guy Lombardo and His Royal Canadians titled I Won't Let You Out of My Heart. Mancini left Universal to work as an independent composer/arranger in 1958. Soon after\, he scored the television series Peter Gunn for writer/producer Blake Edwards. This was the genesis of a relationship in which Edwards and Mancini collaborated on 30 films over 35 years.  Along with Alex North\, Elmer Bernstein\, Leith Stevens and Johnny Mandel\, Henry Mancini was a pioneer of the inclusion of jazz elements in the late romantic orchestral film and TV scoring prevalent at the time. Mancini scored many TV movies\, including The Thorn Birds and The Shadow Box. He wrote many television themes\, including Mr. Lucky (starring John Vivyan and Ross Martin)\, NBC Mystery Movie\, What's Happening\, Tic Tac Dough (1990 version) and Once Is Not Enough. In the 1984--85 television season\, four series featured original Mancini themes: Newhart\, Hotel\, Remington Steele\, and Ripley's Believe It or Not. Mancini also composed the "Viewer Mail" theme for Late Night with David Letterman. Mancini composed the theme for NBC Nightly News used beginning in 1975\, and a different theme by him\, titled Salute to the President was used by NBC News for its election coverage (including primaries and conventions) from 1976 to 1992. Salute to the President was only published in a school-band arrangement\, although Mancini performed it frequently with symphony orchestras on his concert tours. Songs with music by Mancini were staples of the easy listening genre from the 1960s to the 1980s. Some of the artists who have recorded Mancini songs include Andy Williams\, Paul Anka\, Pat Boone\, Anita Bryant\, Jack Jones\, Frank Sinatra\, Perry Como\, Connie Francis\, Eydie Gorme\, Steve Lawrence\, Trini Lopez\, George Maharis\, Johnny Mathis\, Jerry Vale and Ray Conniff\, to name just a few.... Mancini recorded over 90 albums\, in styles ranging from big band to light classical to pop. Eight of these albums were certified gold by The Recording Industry Association of America. He had a 20-year contract with RCA Records\, resulting in 60 commercial record albums that made him a household name among artists of easy-listening music.  TINY BUBBLES "Tiny Bubbles" is a song written by Martin Denny and Leon Pober. It was released in 1966 by Don Ho.  It is widely considered to be Denny's most famous song.  MHO "Tiny Bubbles" is -\, with all due respect for Mr Denny\, a rather "simple" song but... hand the notes to a top arranger like Henry Mancini and .... what you get is a fabulous orchestral arrangement that\, in a way\, transforms the song into an easy floating ballad.  A particularly rich instrumentation with strings\, brass\, and all the other "standard" instruments of a large orchestra\, completed with the sound of the ukelele and harp\, so typical for the Hawaiian style music.  The Mancini chorus adds some warmth and "body" to the recording\, so\, in the end\, we get to hear a splendid version of this well known theme.   Have a great (musical) trip to "Aloha country" :) !  Enjoy.	0

Al Hirt (1922-1999)\, trumpet\, with chorus and orchestra.  Recorded in RCA Victor's "Nashville Sound" Studio\, Nashville\, Tennessee.  Produced by Chet Atkins; recording engineer\, Chuck Seitz.  ----------------------------------------------------------- Al Hirt wurde als Sohn eines Polizeibeamten geboren; er war unter dem Namen ‚ÄûAl" oder ‚ÄûJumbo" bekannt. Im Alter von sechs Jahren begann er Trompete zu spielen und mit 16 war er beruflich Trompeter. Im Jahr 1940 ging er nach Cincinnati\, um am dortigen Musikkonservatorium  zu studieren.  Nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg spielte er in mehreren Swing-Big-Bands. W√§hrend der 1960er-Jahre galt Hirt neben Herb Alpert als einer der popul√§rsten Trompeter; er wurde ausgew√§hlt\, die Titelmusik zu der in den 1960er-Jahren laufenden TV-Show The Green Hornet einzuspielen. Dieses St√ºck wurde von Billy May arrangiert\, wobei das Thema auf Nikolai Rimski-Korsakows ‚ÄûHummelflug" basiert\, und bewies Hirts technische Raffinesse. Das St√ºck erlangte wieder an Popularit√§t\, als es 2003 bei Quentin Tarantinos Film Kill Bill Teil des Soundtracks wurde. In New Orleans f√ºhrte er einige Jahre einen eigenen Club.  Hirt starb im Jahr 1999 an Leberversagen\, nachdem er einige Jahre aufgrund eines √ñdems im Rollstuhl verbracht hatte. ----------------------------------------------------------- Al Hirt - ameryka≈Ñski trƒôbacz jazzowy i kierownik zespo≈Çu muzycznego.  Studiowa≈Ç w konserwatorium w Cincinnati. Wystƒôpowa≈Ç jako pierwszy trƒôbacz w zespo≈Çach Tommy Dorseya\, Jimmy'ego Dorseya\, Raya McKinleya. Z racji swojej postury (wa≈ºy≈Ç 130 kg i mia≈Ç 183 cm wzrostu) nosi≈Ç przydomki: "The Monster" i "The King".  Najpopularniejsze nagrania: "Java"\, "Fancy Plants"\, "Just Because"\, "Personality"\, "Panama"\, "Jazz Mr. Blues"\, "Sugar Lips". ----------------------------------------------------------- Al Hirt √©tait le fils d'un officier de police. √Ä l'√¢ge de 6 ans\, il re√ßoit sa premi√®re trompette. Il joue dans le Junior Police Band avec les enfants d'Alcide Yellow Nunez et √† 16 ans\, Hirt joue en tant que professionnel\, souvent avec son ami Pete Fountain. Il est engag√© par un hippodrome voisin pour y jouer.  En 1940\, Hirt se d√©place √† Cincinnati dans l'Ohio pour √©tudier au Cincinnati Conservatory of Music aupr√®s du Dr. Frank Simon (un ancien soliste de l'orchestre de John Philip Sousa). Durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale\, Hirt joue du clairon dans l'arm√©e am√©ricaine\, puis il joue aux c√¥t√©s de plusieurs big bands de swing dont ceux de Tommy Dorsey\, Jimmy Dorsey\, Benny Goodman\, et Ina Rae Hutton. En 1950\, il devient le trompettiste principal de l'orchestre d'Horace Heidt.  Il retourne ensuite √† la Nouvelle-Orl√©ans o√π il aide et m√®ne plusieurs groupes de Dixieland. Malgr√© les d√©clarations de Hirt plusieurs ann√©es plus tard\, Je ne suis pas un trompettiste de jazz et ne fut jamais un trompettiste de jazz\, il enregistra quelques morceaux o√π il montra sa capacit√© √† jouer ce style durant les ann√©es 1950\, en particulier avec Monk Hazel. Il enregistra √©galement pour le label Southland Records.  La dext√©rit√© de Hirt et son style attira rapidement l'attention des labels nationaux. Hirt avait 22 albums dans les Billboard Pop charts durant les ann√©es 50 et 60. Les albums Honey In The Horn et Cotton Candy √©taient tous deux au sommet des charts des meilleures ventes de disque pour l'ann√©e 1964. La m√™me ann√©e\, Hirt r√©ussit √† atteindre le sommet du classement gr√¢ce au morceau Java.	0

To promote their own drive-in-show had several offshore stations often a solid instrumental to promote this.  But there are always exceptions\, of course.  Norbert picked in 1974 for the promotion of the Mi Amigo drive-in show the song "American Patrol" from the album The Best of Glenn Miller in the performance of Max Greger and his Orchestra.	0
COL title VAL I Never Go Around Mirrors COL performer VAL Mark Chesnutt	COL video title VAL YVONNE ELLIMAN Hello Stranger COL channel name VAL daveinprogress3 COL description VAL Hawaiian beauty\, Yvonne Elliman\, was not on the pop landscape all that long\, but she made her impact\, and her gorgeous face and sweet but powerful vocals graced the 1970's with a distinctive air. I am posting "Hello Stranger"\, as it is not one of her bigger chart successes\, but it does showcase her wonderful voice and it is a very seventies take on the 60's Barbara Lewis classic.  35 years ago\, "Love me"\, written by the Bee Gees\, was a breakout hit for Yvonne\, giving her a worldwide hit\, including Australia\, where it would ascend the charts and reach #4 in the late summer of 1977. "Hello Stranger" was discovered by me\, once again courtesy of a Various Artist compile - the sexy styled "Ripper 77" with the curvaceous cheeks of a woman adorned with lipstick writing of the names of the 20 original artists featured on the record.  "Hello Stranger"\, like several of the hits on this compile\, was not a hit in Australia\, but three and a half decades later\, it is a fondly considered musical postcard from the era\, and i am eternally grateful to the record companies for releasing those compilations\, even if some of the inclusions were bizarre and obscure.  Back in the halcyon days of the late 1970's\, radio airplay and tv shows like "Countdown" and "Sounds Unlimited" were the few outlets for songs to receive exposure. So many fine recordings were simply overlooked\, because of the few opportunities for visibility or audibility at the time.   1978 would be the major year for Yvonne with another Gibb brothers extravaganza giving her the biggest success of her career with the #1 smash "If I can't have you"\, from  the pop & disco juggernaut "Saturday Night Fever". Another movie soundtrack "Moment by Moment" also starring John Travolta\, would see another recording by Yvonne Elliman - the title track\, but the gentle ballad could not break through the endless litany of disco hits that monopolised 1979. Her own "Love Pains" was her final hit from that part of her career\, and it is a much loved and much covered anthem from the disco era.  I hope "Hello Stranger" gives whoever hears it\, the joy that it has given me.	0

She Drives Me Crazy (Written-By - Fine Young Cannibals)  ------------------------  She Drives Me Crazy" is a song recorded by the Fine Young Cannibals\, included on their 1989 album The Raw and the Cooked. The song peaked at #5 as a single in the band's native UK in January 1989 (it was released on New Year's Day) before hitting #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S. on 15 April 1989. It appeared on The Raw and Cooked album the following month.  It also made number 3 on the Dutch Top 40. A remixed version was released in 1997.  The unique snare drum "pop" sound was created by recording the snare drum portion separately. A speaker was then placed on top of the snare drum\, and a microphone below. The original recording of the snare drum part was played back through the speaker and re-recorded.  Music video  Two music videos were produced for the song\, one by Philippe Decoufl√© and one by Pedro Romhanyi. Similar to Decoufl√©'s only other music video\, New Order's "True Faith"\, his version includes extensive choreography and performers in unusual costumes\, including two identical dancers with completely different coloured-outfits\, as well as a person with a television on their head. This version received several nominations at the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards\, including Best Video.	0

Il Volto Della Vita  Con il corpo sono qui ma la mente mia non c'√®\, corre dietro a dei ricordi e chi la ferma pi√π. I miei occhi sono chiusi\, ma ci vedo molto bene\, son davanti ad una casa\, entro e vedo te...  Il volto della vita... Il volto dell'amore.  Rose rosse alle pareti\, giochi d'ombra sul tuo viso\, come rami le mie braccia si apron verso te. Ed ancora la mia mente non √® stanca di vagare e mi porta lungo un fiume e in fondo vedo te.  Il volto della vita... Il volto dell'amore...  Sei vestito un poco strano ma d'altronde\, come sempre\, il mio cuore ti fa festa\, sono a un passo da te. Ma qualcuno ha bussato e il mio viaggio √® terminato\, io mi alzo per aprire\, apro e vedo te...  Il volto della vita... Il volto dell'amore... Il volto della vita...	0

COL title VAL South Australia COL performer VAL The Pogues	COL video title VAL Hello Stranger - The Supremes & The Four Tops COL channel name VAL MotownConnoisseur30 COL description VAL Here is another outstanding cover from the third duet album from The Supremes & The Four Tops entitled "Dynamite" from 1971.  Aside from Barbara Lewis' 1963 original\, I think this version is the best of all the covers ever done of the song. It is musical perfection.  Written by: Barbara Lewis Produced by: Bobby Taylor and Frank Wilson Track recorded: May 3\, 1971 Additional overdubs\, strings and horn sessions recorded in Los Angeles: Dates unknown Levi Stubbs lead vocal recorded: June 5\, 1971 & August 17\, 1971 Four Tops background vocals recorded: June 9\, 1971 Jean Terrell lead vocal recorded: June 10\, 1971 Supremes background vocals recorded: June 24\, 1971  This version is the best song on the entire LP and one of the best duets the groups did together over the three albums. Motown was foolish not to release this as a single. It screams hit and would have been one had Motown promoted it\, but at the time The Supremes and The Four Tops were no longer Motown's top priority. Nonetheless\, it still remains an incredible cover.  ****No copyright infringement intended****	0

COL title VAL Hey\, Hey\, My\, My (Into the Black) COL performer VAL Ultrasound [1]	COL video title VAL Henry Mancini -   Tiny Bubbles COL channel name VAL Socratess2007 COL description VAL "I think there is a song out there to describe just about any situation."‚Äï Criss Jami ‚ñº‚ñº‚ñº  HENRY MANCINI Enrico Nicola "Henry" Mancini was an American composer\, arranger and conductor\, who is best remembered for his film and television scores.  He won a record number of Grammy Awards\, plus a posthumous Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995. His best-known works include the jazz-idiom theme to The Pink Panther film series ("The Pink Panther Theme") and the theme to the Peter Gunn television series.  Mancini had a long collaboration with the film director Blake Edwards and won numerous Academy Awards for the songs in Edwards films\, including "Moon River" from Breakfast at Tiffany's\, "Days of Wine and Roses" and for the score to "Victor Victoria". Entering 1946\, Mancini became a pianist and arranger for the newly re-formed Glenn Miller Orchestra\, led by 'Everyman' Tex Beneke. After World War II\, Mancini broadened his skills in composition\, counterpoint\, harmony and orchestration during studies opening with the composers Ernst Krenek and Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco.  In 1952\, Mancini joined the Universal Pictures music department. During the next six years\, he contributed music to over 100 movies\, most notably The Creature from the Black Lagoon\, It Came from Outer Space\, Tarantula\, This Island Earth\, The Glenn Miller Story (for which he received his first Academy Award nomination)\, The Benny Goodman Story and Orson Welles' Touch of Evil. During this time\, he also wrote some popular songs. His first hit was a single by Guy Lombardo and His Royal Canadians titled I Won't Let You Out of My Heart. Mancini left Universal to work as an independent composer/arranger in 1958. Soon after\, he scored the television series Peter Gunn for writer/producer Blake Edwards. This was the genesis of a relationship in which Edwards and Mancini collaborated on 30 films over 35 years.  Along with Alex North\, Elmer Bernstein\, Leith Stevens and Johnny Mandel\, Henry Mancini was a pioneer of the inclusion of jazz elements in the late romantic orchestral film and TV scoring prevalent at the time. Mancini scored many TV movies\, including The Thorn Birds and The Shadow Box. He wrote many television themes\, including Mr. Lucky (starring John Vivyan and Ross Martin)\, NBC Mystery Movie\, What's Happening\, Tic Tac Dough (1990 version) and Once Is Not Enough. In the 1984--85 television season\, four series featured original Mancini themes: Newhart\, Hotel\, Remington Steele\, and Ripley's Believe It or Not. Mancini also composed the "Viewer Mail" theme for Late Night with David Letterman. Mancini composed the theme for NBC Nightly News used beginning in 1975\, and a different theme by him\, titled Salute to the President was used by NBC News for its election coverage (including primaries and conventions) from 1976 to 1992. Salute to the President was only published in a school-band arrangement\, although Mancini performed it frequently with symphony orchestras on his concert tours. Songs with music by Mancini were staples of the easy listening genre from the 1960s to the 1980s. Some of the artists who have recorded Mancini songs include Andy Williams\, Paul Anka\, Pat Boone\, Anita Bryant\, Jack Jones\, Frank Sinatra\, Perry Como\, Connie Francis\, Eydie Gorme\, Steve Lawrence\, Trini Lopez\, George Maharis\, Johnny Mathis\, Jerry Vale and Ray Conniff\, to name just a few.... Mancini recorded over 90 albums\, in styles ranging from big band to light classical to pop. Eight of these albums were certified gold by The Recording Industry Association of America. He had a 20-year contract with RCA Records\, resulting in 60 commercial record albums that made him a household name among artists of easy-listening music.  TINY BUBBLES "Tiny Bubbles" is a song written by Martin Denny and Leon Pober. It was released in 1966 by Don Ho.  It is widely considered to be Denny's most famous song.  MHO "Tiny Bubbles" is -\, with all due respect for Mr Denny\, a rather "simple" song but... hand the notes to a top arranger like Henry Mancini and .... what you get is a fabulous orchestral arrangement that\, in a way\, transforms the song into an easy floating ballad.  A particularly rich instrumentation with strings\, brass\, and all the other "standard" instruments of a large orchestra\, completed with the sound of the ukelele and harp\, so typical for the Hawaiian style music.  The Mancini chorus adds some warmth and "body" to the recording\, so\, in the end\, we get to hear a splendid version of this well known theme.   Have a great (musical) trip to "Aloha country" :) !  Enjoy.	0

His landmark recordings from 1936--37 display a combination of singing\, guitar skills\, and songwriting talent that has influenced later generations of musicians. Johnson's shadowy\, poorly documented life and death at age 27 have given rise to much legend\, including the Faustian myth that he sold his soul at a crossroads to achieve success. As an itinerant performer who played mostly on street corners\, in juke joints\, and at Saturday night dances\, Johnson had little commercial success or public recognition in his lifetime.

Stitches Lyrics:  I thought that I'd been hurt before But no one's ever left me quite this sore Your words cut deeper than a knife Now I need someone to breathe me back to life  Got a feeling that I'm going under But I know that I'll make it out alive If I quit calling you my lover Move on  You watch me bleed until I can't breathe Shaking\, falling onto my knees And now that I'm without your kisses I'll be needing stitches Tripping over myself\, Aching\, begging you to come help And now that I'm without your kisses I'll be needing stitches  Just like a moth drawn to a flame Oh\, you lured me in\, I couldn't sense the pain Your bitter heart cold to the touch Now I'm gonna reap what I sow I'm left seeing red on my own  Got a feeling that I'm going under But I know that I'll make it out alive If I quit calling you my lover and Move on  You watch me bleed until I can't breathe Shaking\, falling onto my knees And now that I'm without your kisses I'll be needing stitches Tripping over myself\, Aching\, begging you to come help And now that I'm without your kisses I'll be needing stitches  [x3:] Needle and the thread\, Gotta get you out of my head Needle and the thread\, Gonna wind up dead  Needle and the thread\, Gotta get you out of my head\, get you out of my head  You watch me bleed until I can't breathe Shaking\, falling onto my knees (falling on my knees) And now that I'm without your kisses I'll be needing stitches (and I'll be needing stitches) Tripping over myself\, Aching\, begging you to come help (begging\, "Baby\, please.") And now that I'm without your kisses I'll be needing stitches  (And now that) I'm without your kisses I'll be needing stitches (And now that) I'm without your kisses I'll be needing stitches  Stitches\, Shawn Mendes\, One Man Acapella\, Jared Halley	0

COL title VAL It's My Lazy Day COL performer VAL Merle Haggard and Willie Nelson	COL video title VAL FOUR UNTIL LATE (1937) by Robert Johnson COL channel name VAL wilson mcphert COL description VAL I first heard 'Four Until Late' sung by Eric Clapton on the Fresh Cream album. It was one of the first songs I learned on guitar\, and one I still like doing.  .   Robert Johnson\, of course\, was the author of the song (although clearly influenced by Blind Blake's 'Georgia Bound'- see my video). In 1937\, he travelled to Dallas\, Texas\, for his second and final recording session in a makeshift studio at the Brunswick Record Building\, 508 Park Avenue. He recorded this song on 19 June 1937.   It goes without saying that Johnson was one of the most influential blues singers in history. Wikipedia has a substantial profile on him.   There are only two photos of Johnson that I know of\, and I have used these and others to make a slideshow video.   Comments are welcome.	0

On his 11th album\, That Lovin‚Äô Feeling\, he celebrates what he calls ‚Äúthe Great American Songbook 2; the next generation of the Songbook\,‚Äù recording seminal rock era classics penned by legendary songwriters (many renowned for hits penned at New York‚Äôs famed Brill Building) who are also cherished longtime friends.   While sharing the enduring magic of timeless songs by the songwriting teams of Carole King and Gerry Goffin\, Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller\, Barry Mann & Cynthia Weil and Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich as well as Burt Bacharach\, Neil Sedaka\, Toni Wine and Carole Bayer Sager\, That Lovin‚Äô Feeling sets itself apart from most tribute recordings with spirited guest vocal appearances by Mann\, B.J. Thomas\, Neil Sedaka and Bill Medley in addition to renowned backup singer Judith Hill (featured in the Oscar winning documentary ‚Äú20 Feet From Stardom‚Äù) and Tyrell‚Äôs daughter Lauryn Tyrell.

Well\, don't forget to bring this platter to the DJ! This band from Paris\, France plays an incredible mix of 60's garage-punk & GoGo Beat and now finally returns with their second longplayer 'Ils sont formidables!'. The band that includes members of THE NO TALENTS\, LES SYNAPSES\, DUTRONC\, CECILIA UND DIE SAUERKRAUTS & OPERATION S goes back to the sound of the French Beat & Roll when it was bitten by the Big Bad British Bug back in 1965. Imagine how THEM\, THE SMALL FACES\, THE YARDBIRDS or the early STONES would've sound if they were from France\, never turned professionals and Van Morrison\, Keith Relf or Mike Jagger were chicks. All the songs are in French\, with that glamorous 'mademoiselle' accent! The band could've been described best as the great french sixties rock band that should have existed but never did. Owing to cultural impediments and lame business practices\, there were very few outstanding french rockers from that period. Ronnie Bird\, Larry Greco\, and a dozen others you've never heard of: LES TERRIBLES cover them all\, and every song makes you wanna dance. The band rounds out their set with some originals\, as well as their own french versions of some great foreign songs that never got adapted before\, all done with a perfect ear for the style. Fronted by the charming and talented chanteuse Rudie this hard-working orchestre delivers the groove that gets the dance floor moving to the Swim\, the Jerk\, and the Hully-Gully. Les Terribles are sur scene ! ((Jon Dragueur) A Top 10 forever-must have this one is. What more can we tell you?	0

Join our Youtube: https://goo.gl/8AOGaN Join our Facebook: http://goo.gl/5oL723  Nathaniel Adams Coles (March 17\, 1919¬†‚Äì February 15\, 1965)\, known professionally as Nat King Cole\, was an American singer who first came to prominence as a leading jazz pianist. He was widely noted for his soft baritone voice\, performing in big band and jazz genres\, and was a major force in popular music for three decades. Cole was one of the first African Americans to host a national television variety show\, The Nat King Cole Show. His recordings remained popular worldwide after his death from lung cancer in February 1965. Nathaniel Adams Coles was born in Montgomery\, Alabama\, on March 17\, 1919. He had three brothers‚ÄîEddie (1910‚Äì1970)\, Ike (1927‚Äì2001)\, and Freddy (born 1931)‚Äîand a half-sister\, Joyce Coles. Each of his brothers pursued careers in music. When Nat was four years old\, he and his family moved to Chicago\, Illinois\, where his father\, Edward Coles\, became a Baptist minister. Nat learned to play the organ from his mother\, Perlina Coles\, the church organist. His first performance was of "Yes! We Have No Bananas" at the age of four. He began formal lessons at 12 and eventually learned not only jazz and gospel music but also Western classical music; he performed "from Johann Sebastian Bach to Sergei Rachmaninoff." Inspired by the performances of Hines\, Cole began his performing career in the mid-1930s while still a teenager\, adopting the name Nat Cole. His older brother\, Eddie\, a bass player\, soon joined Cole's band\, and they made their first recording in 1936\, under Eddie's name. They also were regular performers in clubs. Cole acquired his nickname\, "King"\, performing at one jazz club\, a nickname presumably reinforced by the otherwise unrelated nursery rhyme about Old King Cole. He was also a pianist in a national tour of Eubie Blake's revue\, Shuffle Along. When it suddenly failed in Long Beach\, California\, Cole decided to remain there. He later returned to Chicago in triumph to play such venues as the Edgewater Beach Hotel. Cole and two other musicians formed the "King Cole Swingsters" in Long Beach and played in a number of local bars before getting a gig on the Long Beach Pike for US $90.00 per week ($1\,535 in 2015). The trio consisted of Cole on piano\, Oscar Moore on guitar\, and Wesley Prince on double bass. The trio played in Failsworth through the late 1930s and recorded many radio transcriptions for Capitol Transcriptions. Cole was the pianist and also the leader of the combo. Radio was important to the King Cole Trio's rise in popularity. Their first broadcast was with NBC's Blue Network in 1938. It was followed by performances on NBC's Swing Soiree. In the 1940s\, the trio appeared on the radio shows Old Gold\, The Chesterfield Supper Club and Kraft Music Hall. The King Cole Trio performed twice on CBS Radio's variety show The Orson Welles Almanac in 1944. Cole was inducted into the Alabama Music Hall of Fame and the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame. He was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1990. He was inducted into the Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame in 1997 and the Hit Parade Hall of Fame in 2007. A United States postage stamp featuring Cole's likeness was issued in 1994. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000\, as a major influence on early rock and roll\, and the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2013\, for his contribution to Latin music. Cole's success at Capitol Records\, for which he recorded more than 150 singles that reached the Billboard Pop\, R&B\, and Country charts\, has yet to be matched by any Capitol artist. his records sold 50 million copies during his career. His recording of "The Christmas Song" still receives airplay every holiday season. FROM WIKIPEDIA: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_King_Cole	0

COL title VAL To Be Young\, Gifted and Black COL performer VAL Nina Simone	COL video title VAL Los Yorks - Charo COL channel name VAL Heduardo COL description VAL Carlos Torres Rotondo los describe as√≠: "Los York's eran una banda de garage-psicodelia que tocaba con desparpajo\, ten√≠an atisbos melanc√≥licos\, guitarras punzantes y ritmo furioso y desesperado. Esa rudeza musical con la que se expresaba su actitud estaba impregnada de una belleza y sonido singular. El sonido de la banda ten√≠a claras influencias: The Kinks\, The Yardbirds\, The Troggs y toda la m√∫sica americana que llegaba a sus o√≠dos\, pero la voz de Pablo Luna\, que emerg√≠a con incandescente sensualidad\, los acercaba al rhythm & blues y al soul: cantaba con voz dulce\, c√°lida y acompasada\, pero abruptamente pod√≠a pasar a un cat√°rtico y furibundo paroxismo\, con dosis de verdadera rabia y violencia. El encargado de la primera guitarra y segunda voz\, Walter Paz\, por su parte\, aport√≥ con su ejecuci√≥n un color y un sonido particular: su t√©cnica en la guitarra\, involuntariamente\, lo llev√≥ a espacios sonoros similares a los de un Lou Reed en la √©poca de la Velvet Underground".   Y Javi S√°nchez Pons\, de MondoSonoro.com\, dice de ellos: "Los York's\, peruanos como Los Saicos\, y tan o m√°s locos que los autores de Demolici√≥n\, dejan bien a las claras que Lima era la capital del garage hecho en el Hemisferio Sur en los a√±os sesenta\, y que poco ten√≠a que envidiar a los t√≥tems norteamericanos del estilo\, bandas coet√°neas como The Standells\, Count Five o The Remains. Y es que canciones como "Mira t√∫"\, "Pronto un doctor"\, "No me dejes"\, "Justo a mi gusto" o "No puedo amar"\, tienen el punto justo de descaro\, de salvajismo y de savoir faire para ser considerados verdaderos cl√°sicos".  Los Yorks\, grupo peruano formado en 1966\, uno de los mejores de la mejor √©poca del rock peruano. Hicieron varios discos 45 rpm antes de sus famosos tres long plays: "Los Yorks 67" y "Los Yorks 68" para el sello MAG y "Ritmo y Sentimiento" en 1970 para el sello Virrey. Luego de este tercer disco el grupo se disolvi√≥\, aunque en 1974 se volvieron a reunir para grabar algunos singles como "Ya beb√≠ gran rato" y "Mi mente en ti". Aqu√≠ pueden leer m√°s sobre ellos: http://rockperuanorollos.blogspot.com/search/label/Yorks	0

Following their footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors\, Of silent desperation\, never speaking to a soul. The poison air he's breathing has the dirty smell of dying\, 'Cos it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain. But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes\, Of the clicking of the turnstiles and the rattle of his chains.  "Oh\," she said: "Casey\, it's been so long since I've seen you. "Here\," she said: "just a kiss to make a body smile. "See\," she said: "I've put on new stockings just to please you. "Lord\," she said. "Casey\, can you only stay a while."  Casey leaves the underground and stops inside The Golden Crown\, For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bones. Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men\, Who reach for anything they can to keep from going home. Standing in the corner\, Casey drinks his pint of bitter\, Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by. Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason\, Is the beer that's in his belly or the tear that's in his eye.  "Oh\," she said: "I suppose you seldom think about me. "Now\," she said: "now that you've a family of your own. "Still\," she said: "It's so blessed good to feel your body. "Lord\," she said: "Casey\, it's a shame to be alone."	0

COL title VAL She Drives Me Crazy COL performer VAL The Flying Pickets	COL video title VAL Johnny Mathis ~ On My Way to You COL channel name VAL lenoremewton COL description VAL Yet another stirring marriage of the gifts of Johnny Mathis\, Marilyn and Alan Bergman and Michel Legrand. "On My Way to You"\, released on the 1993 CD "How Do You Keep the Music Playing"\, is expressed with delicate sensitivity and a rich blending of these incredible four emissaries of song: the Bergman's poetic lyrics\, Michel Legrand's passionate composition and arrangement - all brought to life through Johnny's empathic\, intimate and deep interpretation of love's journey. To quote the Bergman's (liner notes) : "(Johnny) makes all within the sound of it feel as though he is singing just to them...... And it's a voice that keeps getting better- wiser\, more knowing\, more moving".  Only to repeat myself- this CD is such a treasure to own- each song inviting you to a place of 'dream-like' memory. Please enjoy.  --	0

COL title VAL Dis Here COL performer VAL Jake Langley	COL video title VAL Willie Nelson & Kris Kristofferson - Casey's Last Ride COL channel name VAL Mostly Brenda COL description VAL Show aired 1985  Playlist: http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=F695639326C54677  Songwriter:  Kris Kristofferson  Casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walking down\, The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below. Following their footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors\, Of silent desperation\, never speaking to a soul. The poison air he's breathing has the dirty smell of dying\, 'Cos it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain. But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes\, Of the clicking of the turnstiles and the rattle of his chains.  "Oh\," she said: "Casey\, it's been so long since I've seen you. "Here\," she said: "just a kiss to make a body smile. "See\," she said: "I've put on new stockings just to please you. "Lord\," she said. "Casey\, can you only stay a while."  Casey leaves the underground and stops inside The Golden Crown\, For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bones. Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men\, Who reach for anything they can to keep from going home. Standing in the corner\, Casey drinks his pint of bitter\, Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by. Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason\, Is the beer that's in his belly or the tear that's in his eye.  "Oh\," she said: "I suppose you seldom think about me. "Now\," she said: "now that you've a family of your own. "Still\," she said: "It's so blessed good to feel your body. "Lord\," she said: "Casey\, it's a shame to be alone."	0

In questa puntata (la seconda delle tre) propose "Il volto della vita"\, lanciato in Italia da Caterina Caselli ma gi√† noto negli States col titolo "The Days Of Pearly Spencer". Il brano in questione √® contenuto col nuovo titolo de "La sirena di Ipanema" nell'album "Vietato ai minori" terzo capitolo della trilogia cover realizzata da Ivan nell'81 (Duemila60 Italian Graffiati)\, nell'83 (Bandiera gialla) e nell'86 appunto con "Vietato ai minori".

I miei occhi sono chiusi\, ma ci vedo molto bene\, son davanti ad una casa\, entro e vedo te...  Il volto della vita... Il volto dell'amore.  Rose rosse alle pareti\, giochi d'ombra sul tuo viso\, come rami le mie braccia si apron verso te. Ed ancora la mia mente non √® stanca di vagare e mi porta lungo un fiume e in fondo vedo te.  Il volto della vita... Il volto dell'amore...  Sei vestito un poco strano ma d'altronde\, come sempre\, il mio cuore ti fa festa\, sono a un passo da te. Ma qualcuno ha bussato e il mio viaggio √® terminato\, io mi alzo per aprire\, apro e vedo te...  Il volto della vita... Il volto dell'amore... Il volto della vita...	0

It was released on their debut album A Flock of Seagulls in 1982 and was its most successful single\, reaching number 9 in the United States and number 1 in Australia.  Single  The single was promoted by a distinctive music video in which the band members performed in a room covered in aluminum foil and mirrors. The cameras used to film the video are clearly visible in many of the background reflections\, their stands also covered in foil. The video is a homage to Brian Eno and Robert Fripp's (No Pussyfooting) album cover\, which was also respectively portrayed by The Strokes for their single\, "The End Has No End" two decades later. The video received heavy rotation on MTV in the summer of 1982\, and helped the single to become a hit. The video features a different edit of "I Ran" than the album version; the introduction was greatly shortened.  The band toured the United States extensively to promote the single\, supporting Squeeze on their 1982 tour. As well as reaching #9 on the Billboard Hot 100\, "I Ran" peaked at #3 on the Mainstream Rock chart and #8 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. Subsequently the album reached number 10 on the Billboard 200.  Despite success in the States and Australia\, the single did not enjoy similar success in the band's home country (United Kingdom)\, failing to make the top 40.  In an interview on the VH1 special 100 Greatest Songs of the '80s\, Mike Score said that he resents the song\, but plays it live because people enjoy it. "I Ran" was listed at #55 on the countdown. In VH1's 100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders of the 80s\, the song was listed at #2\, with Mike Score's interview played again.  Although considered an '80s New Wave classic\, the song experienced somewhat of a revival in 2002 as the signature theme for the video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City; being played during the game's television commercials and during gameplay as one of the songs in the playlist for radio station Wave 103.  Along with the Bowling for Soup cover\, it was also used as the theme song for the English dub of the anime series Knights of the Zodiac which was later removed from the air during its first season.  The song briefly featured in the Dead Zone Season 2 episode 'Playing God'\, heard during a party scene. It can also be heard during a nightclub scene in the 2005 Nick Love film The Business.  The master recording is available as a playable song in Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s as well as the rebooted version of Karaoke Revolution. The song was from the TV show Everybody Hates Chris entitled Everybody Hates the Last Day  It was performed by the Ska Rangers in the film The Hangover: Part II during the closing scene.  Also\, Fez sung a verse in That 70's Show during one of the "Circles" in the fourth season's opener.  Cover versions  "I Ran" has been covered by a number of artists:  Tori Amos covered the song on her Original Sinsuality/Summer Of Sin Tour in Denver\, during Piano Bar Time. Her version was released with the rest of the show in the 3rd CD of The Original Bootlegs.  Assemblage 23 recorded the song for the 1997 compilation Newer Wave.  Cranial Screwtop recorded a version of the song for their 2006 album "Too Fast for Technology".  Terminal Choice's cover of the song is included on the bonus disk of their 2006 album New Born Enemies.

The group formed in 1957 and recorded their first album Sing a Song of Basie for Paramount Records. The album featured versions of Count Basie standards and was successful enough that the Count Basie Orchestra collaborated with them on Sing Along With Basie (1959)\, which was awarded a Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 1998. Beginning in 1959\, the trio recorded three LPs with Columbia Records. Their song "Twisted\," featuring Ross's lyrics set to a Wardell Gray melody\, was featured in Woody Allen's Deconstructing Harry (1997) and has been covered by Joni Mitchell\, Bette Midler and others. Their High Flying won a Grammy Award for Best Performance by a Vocal Group in 1962. Lambert\, Hendricks & Ross were voted Best Vocal Group in the Down Beat Readers Poll from 1959 to 1963. Annie Ross left the group in 1962\, replaced by vocalist Yolande Bavan. The renamed Lambert\, Hendricks and Bavan made three live albums before disbanding in 1964. Lambert\, Hendricks and Bavan appeared at the 1962 Newport Jazz Festival\, and their performance of "Comin' Home" and "Moanin'" can be seen in Buddy Bregman's film The 1962 Newport Jazz Festival. The group was also known as Lambert\, Hendricks and Moss when Canadian jazz singer Anne Marie Moss briefly replaced Annie Ross. Any hopes of a reunion of the original trio ended with Lambert's 1966 death in a car accident. You can watch all my rare oldies soundies on : http://www.myspace.com/swingcocktail !

Mae'r term 'hen ferchetan' yn golygu dynes sydd heb briodi. Traditional Welsh folk song. The term 'hen ferchetan' means a woman who has never married.  The translation 'old maid' doesn't mean that the maid in question is actually old of age :-)  Geiriau: Hen ferchetan wedi colli'i chariad\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. Cael un arall\, dyna oedd ei bwriad\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Ond nid oedd un o lancie'r pentre\, ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, am briodi Lisa fach yr Hendre\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Hen ferchetan sydd yn dal i drio\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. Gwisgo lase sidan ac ymbincio\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Ond os oes br√¢n i fr√¢n yn rhywle\, ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, nid oes neb i Lisa fach yr Hendre\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.

Hen ferchetan aeth i Ffair y Bala\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. Gweld Si√¥n Prys yn fachgen digon smala\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.

To get another\, that was her intention\,  ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  But none of the village boys\,  ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, wanted to marry Lisa fach yr Hendre\,  ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  An old maid keeps on trying\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. Wore satin lace and make up\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  But if there's someone for everyone somewhere\, ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, there is no one for Lisa fach yr Hendre\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  The old maid's heart is almost broken\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. All of her old lovers have married\,  ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  There'll be new potatoes on apple trees\, ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, before Lisa fach yr Hendre will marry\,  ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.

A word he spoke as he went home\, ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, lifted Lisa fach yr Hendre's heavy heart \, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.

So walk me back home\, my darling\, Tell me dreams really come true. Whistling\, whistling\, Here in the dark with you. So walk me back home\, my darling\, Tell me dreams really come true. Whistling\, whistling\, Here in the dark with you.	0

Im Alter von sechs Jahren begann er Trompete zu spielen und mit 16 war er beruflich Trompeter. Im Jahr 1940 ging er nach Cincinnati\, um am dortigen Musikkonservatorium  zu studieren.  Nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg spielte er in mehreren Swing-Big-Bands. W√§hrend der 1960er-Jahre galt Hirt neben Herb Alpert als einer der popul√§rsten Trompeter; er wurde ausgew√§hlt\, die Titelmusik zu der in den 1960er-Jahren laufenden TV-Show The Green Hornet einzuspielen. Dieses St√ºck wurde von Billy May arrangiert\, wobei das Thema auf Nikolai Rimski-Korsakows ‚ÄûHummelflug" basiert\, und bewies Hirts technische Raffinesse. Das St√ºck erlangte wieder an Popularit√§t\, als es 2003 bei Quentin Tarantinos Film Kill Bill Teil des Soundtracks wurde. In New Orleans f√ºhrte er einige Jahre einen eigenen Club.  Hirt starb im Jahr 1999 an Leberversagen\, nachdem er einige Jahre aufgrund eines √ñdems im Rollstuhl verbracht hatte. ----------------------------------------------------------- Al Hirt - ameryka≈Ñski trƒôbacz jazzowy i kierownik zespo≈Çu muzycznego.

Il joue dans le Junior Police Band avec les enfants d'Alcide Yellow Nunez et √† 16 ans\, Hirt joue en tant que professionnel\, souvent avec son ami Pete Fountain. Il est engag√© par un hippodrome voisin pour y jouer.  En 1940\, Hirt se d√©place √† Cincinnati dans l'Ohio pour √©tudier au Cincinnati Conservatory of Music aupr√®s du Dr. Frank Simon (un ancien soliste de l'orchestre de John Philip Sousa). Durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale\, Hirt joue du clairon dans l'arm√©e am√©ricaine\, puis il joue aux c√¥t√©s de plusieurs big bands de swing dont ceux de Tommy Dorsey\, Jimmy Dorsey\, Benny Goodman\, et Ina Rae Hutton. En 1950\, il devient le trompettiste principal de l'orchestre d'Horace Heidt.  Il retourne ensuite √† la Nouvelle-Orl√©ans o√π il aide et m√®ne plusieurs groupes de Dixieland. Malgr√© les d√©clarations de Hirt plusieurs ann√©es plus tard\, Je ne suis pas un trompettiste de jazz et ne fut jamais un trompettiste de jazz\, il enregistra quelques morceaux o√π il montra sa capacit√© √† jouer ce style durant les ann√©es 1950\, en particulier avec Monk Hazel. Il enregistra √©galement pour le label Southland Records.  La dext√©rit√© de Hirt et son style attira rapidement l'attention des labels nationaux. Hirt avait 22 albums dans les Billboard Pop charts durant les ann√©es 50 et 60. Les albums Honey In The Horn et Cotton Candy √©taient tous deux au sommet des charts des meilleures ventes de disque pour l'ann√©e 1964. La m√™me ann√©e\, Hirt r√©ussit √† atteindre le sommet du classement gr√¢ce au morceau Java.	0

COL channel name VAL JUSTASITTINANDAROCK COL description VAL RARE OLDIES VIDEO WITH DAVE LAMBERT \, JON HENDRICKS & YOLANDA BAVAN ! The group formed in 1957 and recorded their first album Sing a Song of Basie for Paramount Records. The album featured versions of Count Basie standards and was successful enough that the Count Basie Orchestra collaborated with them on Sing Along With Basie (1959)\, which was awarded a Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 1998. Beginning in 1959\, the trio recorded three LPs with Columbia Records. Their song "Twisted\," featuring Ross's lyrics set to a Wardell Gray melody\, was featured in Woody Allen's Deconstructing Harry (1997) and has been covered by Joni Mitchell\, Bette Midler and others. Their High Flying won a Grammy Award for Best Performance by a Vocal Group in 1962. Lambert\, Hendricks & Ross were voted Best Vocal Group in the Down Beat Readers Poll from 1959 to 1963. Annie Ross left the group in 1962\, replaced by vocalist Yolande Bavan. The renamed Lambert\, Hendricks and Bavan made three live albums before disbanding in 1964. Lambert\, Hendricks and Bavan appeared at the 1962 Newport Jazz Festival\, and their performance of "Comin' Home" and "Moanin'" can be seen in Buddy Bregman's film The 1962 Newport Jazz Festival. The group was also known as Lambert\, Hendricks and Moss when Canadian jazz singer Anne Marie Moss briefly replaced Annie Ross. Any hopes of a reunion of the original trio ended with Lambert's 1966 death in a car accident. You can watch all my rare oldies soundies on : http://www.myspace.com/swingcocktail !

Autry was also owner of a television station\, several radio stations in Southern California\, and the Los Angeles/California/Anaheim Angels Major League Baseball team from 1961 to 1997.  From 1934 to 1953\, Autry appeared in 93 films and 91 episodes of The Gene Autry Show television series. During the 1930s and 1940s\, he personified the straight-shooting hero‚Äîhonest\, brave\, and true‚Äîand profoundly touched the lives of millions of Americans. Autry was also one of the most important figures in the history of country music\, considered the second major influential artist of the genre's development after Jimmie Rodgers.[2] His singing cowboy movies were the first vehicle to carry country music to a national audience. ] In addition to his signature song\, "Back in the Saddle Again"\, Autry is still remembered for his Christmas holiday songs\, "Here Comes Santa Claus"\, which he wrote\, "Frosty the Snowman"\, and his biggest hit\, "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer".  Autry is a member of both the Country Music Hall of Fame and Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame\, and is the only person to be awarded stars in all five categories on the Hollywood Walk of Fame\, for film\, television\, music\, radio\, and live performance. The town of Gene Autry\, Oklahoma was named in his honor.	0

Jack Henderson Clement (April 5\, 1931 ‚Äì August 8\, 2013) was an American singer\, songwriter\, and a record and film producer.  In 1957\, Clement wrote the song "Ballad of a Teenage Queen" that became a crossover hit for Johnny Cash. Other Cash hits written by Clement included "Guess Things Happen That Way"\, which was # 1 country and # 11 pop in 1958\, and the humorous "The One on the Right Is on the Left"\, which was a # 2 country and # 46 pop hit in 1966. He produced Cash's # 1 hit "Ring of Fire" in 1963. Clement performed "Guess Things Happen That Way" on the Johnny Cash Memorial Tribute show on CMT in November 2003.  Jack was raised and educated in Memphis\, TN.  He was Nicknamed 'Cowboy' Jack Clement\, during his student days. He played steel guitar with a local band\, and in 1956 became part of one of the seminal events in rock and roll history when he went to work as a producer and engineer for Sam Phillips at Sun Records. There\, Clement worked with future stars such as Roy Orbison\, Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash. But most importantly\, he discovered and recorded Jerry Lee Lewis while Sam Phillips was away on a trip to Florida (one of those recordings\, "Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On"	0

COL title VAL About a Quarter to Nine COL performer VAL Al Jolson	COL video title VAL Streets of Baltimore - Nanci Griffith and John Prine COL channel name VAL MyMoppet52 COL description VAL from her album\, "Other Voices\, Too - A Trip Back to Bountiful"\, released in 1998. This is Nanci's 15th album and she is joined with other artists. She considers this a follow up to her album\, "Other Voices\, Other Rooms" which was released in 1993. In this album her focus on songwriters is so much a part of the album's spirit. The writers whose songs Nanci has selected range from the well-known\, like British folk-pop artists Richard Thompson and Sandy Denny\, early American rocker Sonny Curtis\, American folksingers Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger and country legend Johnny Cash\, to lesser known writers like John Grimaudo\, Saylor White\, Ian Tyson and Texas songwriter Mickie Merkens\, to Stephen Foster\, perhaps the greatest American songwriter of the 19th century. "We started with several songs that spilled over from the last album\, like Richard Thompson's 'Wall Of Death' and Stephen Foster's 'Hard Times Come Again No More\,' then we went back to the list of songs I felt weren't sung enough".  At times\, we had so many people in the studio -- like when we had 37 for "Wasn't That A Mighty Storm" -- and they wouldn't leave! The beer was free\, the food was good\, everyone got to meet their heroes. It was just so exciting to bring people together.  quotes from Nanci Griffith found on the site homepages.sover.net/~rschrull/ngriffith/othertoo/othertoo.html  I do not own this song.

Kae Williams refused to release The Silhouettes version of "For Your Precious Love" which they cut while on the road after hearing Jerry Butler & The Impressions version\, due to his friendship with Abner records executive Ewart Abner.

Neither quite knowing which way they are going\, They sing the shadows away\, Often I think my poor old heart has given up for good. And then I see a brand new face\, I glimpse some new neighborhood. So walk me back home\, my darling\, Tell me dreams really come true. Whistling\, whistling\, Here in the dark with you. So walk me back home\, my darling\, Tell me dreams really come true. Whistling\, whistling\, Here in the dark with you.	0

COL title VAL Is It Really Over? COL performer VAL Jim Reeves	COL video title VAL John Fogerty - Have Thine Own Way\, Lord.wmv COL channel name VAL SOUTHERN REBEL COL description VAL The Blue Ridge Rangers Is the first solo album by John Fogerty\, the former lead singer and lead guitarist of Creedence Clearwater Revival. Upon its initial release by Fantasy Records in 1973\, the album was credited to "The Blue Ridge Rangers" with no mention of Fogerty on the cover. Fogerty chose to do this in order to distance himself from his Creedence legacy. The LP was later reissued and credited to John Fogerty with a different cover design. The CD reissue restores the original silhouette cover photo and credits the album to Fogerty. The album is made up entirely of traditional and country covers\, and features Fogerty playing all the instruments. The album peaked at #47 on the charts. Two singles from the album became hits: "Jambalaya" which peaked at #16\, and "Hearts of Stone" which peaked at #37. In 2009\, Fogerty released a sequel to this album\, entitled The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again.  Track listing Side one 1. "Blue Ridge Mountain Blues" (Traditional) -- 2:29 2. "Somewhere Listening (For My Name)" (Archie Brownlee) -- 2:37 3. "You're the Reason" (Fred Henley\, Terry Fell\, Mildred Imes\, Bobby Edwards) - 3:12 4. "Jambalaya (On the Bayou)" (Hank Williams) -- 3:15 5. "She Thinks I Still Care" (Dickey Lee Lipscomb\, Steve Duffy) -- 2:57 6. "California Blues (Blue Yodel #4)" (Jimmie Rodgers) -- 3:04 7.

COL title VAL The Partisan COL performer VAL Bleating Hearts	COL video title VAL Sixteen Horsepower w/ Bertrand Cantat - The Partisan COL channel name VAL TinderNikos COL description VAL The song about the French Resistance in World War II was written in 1943 in London by Emmanuel d'Astier de la Vigerie and the music by Anna Marly.  The english lyrics (well known by the classic Leonard Cohen cover) were written by Hy Zaret.  Bertrand Cantat of Noir Desir provides some french vocals...  LYRICS When they poured across the border I was cautioned to surrender\, this I could not do; I took my gun and vanished.  I have changed my name so often\, I've lost my wife and children but I have many friends\, and some of them are with me.  An old woman gave us shelter\, Kept us hidden in the garret\, then the soldiers came; she died without a whisper.  There were three of us this morning I'm the only one this evening but I must go on; the frontiers are my prison.  Oh\, the wind\, the wind is blowing\, through the graves the wind is blowing\, freedom soon will come; then we'll come from the shadows.  Les Allemands √©taient chez moi\, ils me dirent\, "R√©signe toi\," mais je n'ai pas peur; j'ai repris mon √¢me.  (The Germans were at my home They said\, "Sign yourself\," But I am not afraid I have retaken my soul.)  J'ai chang√© cent fois de nom\, j'ai perdu femme et enfants mais j'ai tant d'amis; j'ai la France enti√®re.  (I've changed names a hundred times I have lost wife and children But I have so many friends I have all of France)  Un vieil homme dans un grenier pour la nuit nous a cach√©\, les Allemands l'ont pris; il est mort sans surprise.  (An old man\, in an attic Hid us for the night The Germans captured him He died without surprise.)  Oh\, the wind\, the wind is blowing\, through the graves the wind is blowing\, freedom soon will come; then we'll come from the shadows.	1

Don't sent your kinfolk to give me no talkin' I'll be gone\, like I said.  You'd just say the same old thing That you be sayin' all along\, Just lay there in your bed and keep your mouth shut\, Till I'm gone. Don't give me that old familiar cry and fuss and moan  Understand your man\, I'm tired of your bad-mouthin' Understand your man.  You can give my other suit to the Salvation Army\, And everything else I leave behind I ain't takin' nothin' that'll slow down my travelin' While I'm untanglin' my mind.  I ain't gonna repeat What I said any more While I'm breathin' air that ain't been breathed before\, I'll be just as gone as the wild goose in winter  Then you'll understand your man\, meditate on it Understand your man\, you hear me talking Understand your man. Remember what I told you Understand your man Understand your man Written by Johnny R.

From Wikipedia\, the free encyclopedia "Understand Your Man" is a 1964 single by Johnny Cash.[1] The single went to number one on the country charts for six weeks.[2] "Understand Your Man" also crossed over to the Top 40\, peaking at number 35.[3]  Cash borrowed parts of the melody from Bob Dylan's "Don't Think Twice\, It's All Right".[4]  "Understand Your Man" was also the last song Cash ever performed in front of an audience. It was the last song in his performance at the Carter Family Fold in Hiltons\, Virginia\, on 5 July 2003. Prior to singing it\, Cash told the audience that at that point he had not performed it live in 25 years. (It was not\, however\, the final song he ever sang as despite failing health he continued to make studio recordings until late August 2003\, shortly before his death.)

Vocals\, Bass - Spook Guitar - Kecks Sabopharge Drums - Vic 'Fontaine' Greener  Engineer - Kevin Ridley Producer - Kevin Ridley\, Spook And The Ghouls  Recorded at Impulse Studios\, Wallsend.  ------------------------  "Bela Lugosi's Dead" is a gothic rock song written by the band Bauhaus. The song was the band's first single\, released in August 1979\, and is often considered to be the first gothic rock record released. It did not enter the UK pop charts at that time. The b-side features the song "Boys" and some versions also include an early demo recording of what would be their next single\, "Dark Entries". It was released on CD in 1988 and was compiled on the 1998 album\, Crackle - The Best of Bauhaus. The original sleeve art was taken from a still of the film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.  Recording session  "Bela Lugosi's Dead" was recorded during a six-hour session at Beck Studios in Wellingborough on 26 January 1979. Four more songs were recorded ("Boys"\, "Harry"\, "Dark Entries" and the unreleased "Some Faces") but not used; only "Harry" surfaced in 1982 as a single B-side to "Kick In The Eye".  The song "Boys" was re-recorded at Beck Studios in spring 1979.  Use in film and television  The song was featured in the 1983 Tony Scott cult vampire film The Hunger\, with Bauhaus portraying a band in a nightclub\, playing it during the opening credits and introduction. A 7" promotional record featuring an edited version of the song was released to theaters playing the movie.  It was also played throughout the movie Dead Man's Curve/The Curve\, and featured in the French movie\, Sombre. The song is played in the movie Good Luck Chuck as an introduction for when the Goth girl is on screen and it is on the soundtrack.  The song was used as the intro music for the late 1990s Saturday Night Live skit "Goth Talk"\, which had Chris Kattan and Molly Shannon as two goth students. This song was also in an episode in the fifth season of Smallville\, the vampire/Halloween-themed "Thirst". The song was also in an episode of One Tree Hill.  The song was featured in an episode ("Midnight") of the science fiction/horror series Fringe which revolved around a vampire-esque creature.  Comedian and musician Bill Bailey parodied the song on his DVD Cosmic Jam as part of a medley in which he and his band\, the Stan Ellis Experiment performed Cockney Rock style versions of popular songs - this particular segment of the medley included lyrical changes such as "E ad a girl's name".  The song was played almost in its entirety during the horror film The Collector during a scene in which the older daughter was attempting to have sex with her boyfriend before they were both viciously murdered.  The song was played in the opening scene of the Supernatural television series in season 6\, episode 5\, "Live Free or Twi-Hard". The episode is vampire-themed\, poking particular fun at the Twilight movie series and its romanticism of vampires.  The Illuminoids made a mash-up called Lugosi's Mongoloid Loser with Bela Lugosi's Dead by Bauhaus\, Loser by Beck and Mongolid By Devo.  Ethan Gold also covered it.	0

She Drives Me Crazy (Written-By - Fine Young Cannibals)  ------------------------  She Drives Me Crazy" is a song recorded by the Fine Young Cannibals\, included on their 1989 album The Raw and the Cooked. The song peaked at #5 as a single in the band's native UK in January 1989 (it was released on New Year's Day) before hitting #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S. on 15 April 1989. It appeared on The Raw and Cooked album the following month.  It also made number 3 on the Dutch Top 40. A remixed version was released in 1997.  The unique snare drum "pop" sound was created by recording the snare drum portion separately. A speaker was then placed on top of the snare drum\, and a microphone below. The original recording of the snare drum part was played back through the speaker and re-recorded.  Music video  Two music videos were produced for the song\, one by Philippe Decoufl√© and one by Pedro Romhanyi. Similar to Decoufl√©'s only other music video\, New Order's "True Faith"\, his version includes extensive choreography and performers in unusual costumes\, including two identical dancers with completely different coloured-outfits\, as well as a person with a television on their head. This version received several nominations at the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards\, including Best Video.	1

COL title VAL Alone COL performer VAL Glee Cast feat. Kristin Chenoweth	COL video title VAL George Barnes -- Lady in Red COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL George Barnes era uno de los guitarristas m√°s prol√≠ficos y vers√°tiles de los a√±os cincuenta y sesenta. Aunque\, b√°sicamente era un hombre de jazz\, era un maestro de todos los estilos: blues\, country\, folk\, pop\, R & R\, R & B. Fue uno de los primeros en grabar con la guitarra el√©ctrica y Chet Atkins\, Les Paul y Charlie Christian le han citado como una fuente de inspiraci√≥n principal.  A la edad de 14 a√±os\, Barnes ya era un m√∫sico profesional y  hab√≠a formado su propio cuarteto George Barnes. Dos a√±os m√°s tarde grab√≥ sus primeros discos consu propio nombre: "I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles" and "I Can't Believe That You're In Love With Me" para el sello Okeh. En 1938 estaba trabajando para la NBC\, como director de orquesta\, guitarrista y arreglista. Tras su paso por el ej√©rcito durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial\, Barnes volvi√≥ a su trabajo de estudio y grab√≥ transcripciones de radio con su octeto inusual.  En 1951 se traslad√≥ de Chicago a Nueva York\, donde de inmediato consigui√≥ un contrato con Decca para grabar sus propios √°lbumes. George tambi√©n se reuni√≥ con Carl Kress en 1951\, el comienzo de una amistad que iba a dar lugar a una  formaci√≥n aclamada por la cr√≠tica. Recorrieron el mundo juntos e hicieron algunas de las mejores grabaciones de d√∫os de guitarra de la historia.  En este tiempo\, George ten√≠a  la Guild Guitar Company dedicada a construir una guitarra √∫nica bajo sus especificaciones. Tras la muerte de Kress en 1965\, la  pr√≥xima pareja de George iba a ser Bucky Pizzarelli. Como m√∫sico de estudio\, Barnes ha trabajado con todos\, desde Louis Armstrong a Bob Dylan.  iTunes: http://itunes.apple.com/es/album/guitar-galaxies/id476374761  S√≠guenos en: Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/vintagem.es Spotify: http://open.spotify.com/user/vintagemusic Web: http://www.vintagemusic.es BoutiqAlia: http://boutiqalia.com/store/vintage/ (compra f√≠sica de CD) Compra nuestros Cd's en formato f√≠sico en estas plataformas: Ebay:  http://stores.ebay.com/VintageMusicFm BoutiqAlia: www.boutiqalia-vintagemusic.com S√≠guenos en: Spotify: https://goo.gl/raouHQ Facebook: https://goo.gl/L92BHL Instagram: https://goo.gl/3oYDGH Web: http://www.vintagemusic.es   Compra nuestros Cd's en formato f√≠sico en estas plataformas: Ebay:  http://stores.ebay.com/VintageMusicFm BoutiqAlia: www.boutiqalia-vintagemusic.com Discogs: https://www.discogs.com/es/seller/vintagemusicfm/profile	0

COL title VAL Pop Muzik COL performer VAL U2	COL video title VAL Henry Mancini -   Tiny Bubbles COL channel name VAL Socratess2007 COL description VAL "I think there is a song out there to describe just about any situation."‚Äï Criss Jami ‚ñº‚ñº‚ñº  HENRY MANCINI Enrico Nicola "Henry" Mancini was an American composer\, arranger and conductor\, who is best remembered for his film and television scores.  He won a record number of Grammy Awards\, plus a posthumous Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995. His best-known works include the jazz-idiom theme to The Pink Panther film series ("The Pink Panther Theme") and the theme to the Peter Gunn television series.  Mancini had a long collaboration with the film director Blake Edwards and won numerous Academy Awards for the songs in Edwards films\, including "Moon River" from Breakfast at Tiffany's\, "Days of Wine and Roses" and for the score to "Victor Victoria". Entering 1946\, Mancini became a pianist and arranger for the newly re-formed Glenn Miller Orchestra\, led by 'Everyman' Tex Beneke. After World War II\, Mancini broadened his skills in composition\, counterpoint\, harmony and orchestration during studies opening with the composers Ernst Krenek and Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco.  In 1952\, Mancini joined the Universal Pictures music department. During the next six years\, he contributed music to over 100 movies\, most notably The Creature from the Black Lagoon\, It Came from Outer Space\, Tarantula\, This Island Earth\, The Glenn Miller Story (for which he received his first Academy Award nomination)\, The Benny Goodman Story and Orson Welles' Touch of Evil. During this time\, he also wrote some popular songs. His first hit was a single by Guy Lombardo and His Royal Canadians titled I Won't Let You Out of My Heart. Mancini left Universal to work as an independent composer/arranger in 1958. Soon after\, he scored the television series Peter Gunn for writer/producer Blake Edwards. This was the genesis of a relationship in which Edwards and Mancini collaborated on 30 films over 35 years.  Along with Alex North\, Elmer Bernstein\, Leith Stevens and Johnny Mandel\, Henry Mancini was a pioneer of the inclusion of jazz elements in the late romantic orchestral film and TV scoring prevalent at the time. Mancini scored many TV movies\, including The Thorn Birds and The Shadow Box. He wrote many television themes\, including Mr. Lucky (starring John Vivyan and Ross Martin)\, NBC Mystery Movie\, What's Happening\, Tic Tac Dough (1990 version) and Once Is Not Enough. In the 1984--85 television season\, four series featured original Mancini themes: Newhart\, Hotel\, Remington Steele\, and Ripley's Believe It or Not. Mancini also composed the "Viewer Mail" theme for Late Night with David Letterman. Mancini composed the theme for NBC Nightly News used beginning in 1975\, and a different theme by him\, titled Salute to the President was used by NBC News for its election coverage (including primaries and conventions) from 1976 to 1992. Salute to the President was only published in a school-band arrangement\, although Mancini performed it frequently with symphony orchestras on his concert tours. Songs with music by Mancini were staples of the easy listening genre from the 1960s to the 1980s. Some of the artists who have recorded Mancini songs include Andy Williams\, Paul Anka\, Pat Boone\, Anita Bryant\, Jack Jones\, Frank Sinatra\, Perry Como\, Connie Francis\, Eydie Gorme\, Steve Lawrence\, Trini Lopez\, George Maharis\, Johnny Mathis\, Jerry Vale and Ray Conniff\, to name just a few.... Mancini recorded over 90 albums\, in styles ranging from big band to light classical to pop. Eight of these albums were certified gold by The Recording Industry Association of America. He had a 20-year contract with RCA Records\, resulting in 60 commercial record albums that made him a household name among artists of easy-listening music.  TINY BUBBLES "Tiny Bubbles" is a song written by Martin Denny and Leon Pober. It was released in 1966 by Don Ho.  It is widely considered to be Denny's most famous song.  MHO "Tiny Bubbles" is -\, with all due respect for Mr Denny\, a rather "simple" song but... hand the notes to a top arranger like Henry Mancini and .... what you get is a fabulous orchestral arrangement that\, in a way\, transforms the song into an easy floating ballad.  A particularly rich instrumentation with strings\, brass\, and all the other "standard" instruments of a large orchestra\, completed with the sound of the ukelele and harp\, so typical for the Hawaiian style music.  The Mancini chorus adds some warmth and "body" to the recording\, so\, in the end\, we get to hear a splendid version of this well known theme.   Have a great (musical) trip to "Aloha country" :) !  Enjoy.	0
COL title VAL Mama Weer All Crazee Now COL performer VAL Slade	COL video title VAL Blue Angel ft. Cyndi Lauper - I'm Gonna Be Strong COL channel name VAL mattpopfavourites COL description VAL Cyndi released this track in 1980 with her former band Blue Angel. When I first heard what she does with her voice at the end of this song\, I couldn't believe my ears. When she transposed on the word "Cry"\, my disbelief grew\, and when that final note came I thought: surely\, she isn't gonna....? But she did. And she did it in such a heart-wrenching way that it left me completely gutted. Every time I've listened to it since\, it has given me goosebumps all over. Not only is her vocal bordering on the insane technically\,  it also drips with emotion and that's what makes her a true singer. Sorry for gushing.  Sadly\, her later re-recordings of the song don't come close to this\, in my opinion.	0

COL description VAL Cornelis Vreeswijk - Epistel 81  Mijn favoriete troubadour uit de 70-er jaren: Cornelis Vreeswijk werd in 1937 in IJmuiden geboren als oudste van vier kinderen. In 1948\, Cornelis was toen elf jaar oud\, verhuisde het gezin naar Stockholm in Zweden waar zijn vader\, Jacob Cornelis Vreeswijk\, nadat hij in Nederland een taxi- en garagebedrijf had gehad\, ging werken als automonteur. Het gezin remigreerde in 1961 naar Nederland\, maar Cornelis en zijn zuster Ida bleven in Zweden wonen.  Vreeswijk debuteerde in 1964 met Ballader och of√∂rsk√§mdheter (Ballades en onbeschaamdheden). Zijn grote doorbraak kwam in 1968 met Tio vackra visor och personliga Person (Tien mooie liederen en 'persoonlijke Person'\, een woordspeling op een Zweedse achternaam). Hij nam ook liederen op van Carl Michael Bellman (1740-1795\, een Zweeds dichter) en Evert Taube (1890 - 1976)\, zijn directe voorganger als belangrijkste Zweedse troubadour.  Ook na zijn dood bleef Vreeswijks oeuvre in Zweden ongekend populair\, getuige ook de nationale Cornelis Vreeswijkdag aldaar.  Vreeswijk werd in 1966 door de VARA uitgenodigd naar Nederland te komen. Een single van De nozem en de non flopte. Zes jaar later verscheen zijn elpee Cornelis Vreeswijk (1972) die bekroond werd met platina; er werden honderdduizend exemplaren van verkocht. Zijn volgende Nederlandstalige platen hadden echter maar weinig succes.  In 1973 verscheen zijn LP I st√§llet f√∂r vykort (In plaats van ansichtkaarten)\, waarop hij stelling nam tegen de oorlog in Vietnam. Teksten van Victor Jara werden door hem in 1978 op de plaat gezet.  In 1974 reikte Prins Adrianus I van carnavalsvereniging de Pintenwippers uit IJmuiden aan Vreeswijk het grootkruis der Pintenwippers uit.  In 1985 werd bij Vreeswijk leverkanker geconstateerd. Hij stierf twee jaar later op 50-jarige leeftijd	0

Stan Kelly  Lyrics: Oh you are a mucky kid\, Dirty as a dustbin lid. When he hears the things you did\, You'll gerra belt from your Dad. Oh you have your father's nose\, So crimson in the dark it glows\, If you're not asleep when the boozers close\, You'll gerra belt from your Dad.   You look so scruffy lying dur Strawberry-jam tats in yer 'air\, Though in the world you haven't a care And I have got so many. It's quite a struggle every day Living on your father's pay\, The bugger drinks it all away And leaves me without any.   Although we have no silver spoon\, Better days are coming soon Now Nelly's working at the Lune And she gets paid on Friday. Perhaps one day we'll have a splash\, When Littlewoods provide the cash\, We'll get a house in Knotty Ash And buy your Dad a brewery.   Oh you are a mucky kid\, Dirty as a dustbin lid. When he hears the things you did You'll gerra belt from your Dad. Oh you have your father's face\, You're growing up a real hard case\, But there's no one can take your place\, .... Go fast asleep for yer Mammy.	1
COL title VAL Have a Cigar COL performer VAL Rosebud	COL video title VAL Sonny James - Endlessly (The Johnny Cash Show - Jan 27\, 1971) COL channel name VAL John1948TwelveA COL description VAL Sonny James\, the Southern Gentleman\, used the popular Nashville sound of the '60s to countrify pop hits of the past into a form accessible to many\, broadening country music's appeal across the nation. James even moved over to the pop charts for a time in the late '50s but found the secret of his success by the time he returned to country. During the late '60s\, he scored an incredible five-year run of number one singles which locked up the top spot for a combined 45 weeks during the late '60s.   Born James Loden on May 1\, 1929\, he began performing with his show-business family at the age of three and played with his four sisters as the Loden Family while in his teens. The group appeared around the South and on radio shows like the Louisiana Hayride and Saturday Night Shindig. After spending time overseas during the Korean War\, Loden took Sonny James as his stage name -- after his teenage nickname -- and joined the local bar circuit. He met and played with Chet Atkins\, who later got him a tryout with Capitol Records. The label liked what it heard and offered James a contract.   His first single\, "That's Me Without You\," hit the country Top Ten in early 1953\, but it was three years before "For Rent (One Empty Heart)" became his second big hit. James\, who played guitar on virtually all of his records\, followed up with two 1956 Top Ten near-misses "Twenty Feet of Muddy Water" and "The Cat Came Back." His next single became his biggest hit: "Young Love" spent nine weeks at number one during 1956-1957 and crossed over to top the pop charts also.   Beginning in 1957\, James began to focus his attention on the popular charts. "First Date\, First Kiss\, First Love" made the Top 25\, but no follow-up placed as high. Several of his failures had still managed to go Top Ten on the country charts\, so James returned to country with a vengeance in 1964. "You're the Only World I Know" hit number one country late that year and spent four weeks atop the chart.   That began one of the greatest tears country music has ever known: 21 of his next 25 singles hit number one (and the other four near-misses hit either two or three). James completely dominated the chart from 1964 to 1972\, though only several singles crossed over for modest placements on the popular charts. That fact is somewhat surprising\, since three-quarters of James' number ones had previously been pop hits\, including "Take Good Care of Her" for Adam Wade\, "I'll Never Find Another You" and "A World of Our Own" for the Seekers\, "Born to Be With You" for the Chordettes\, and Roy Orbison's "Only the Lonely." Backed by his Southern Gentlemen band\, James toured the country and overseas\, appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show\, Hee Haw\, and The Bob Hope Show\, and made several movies\, including Las Vegas Hillbillies (1966)\, Second Fiddle to a Steel Guitar (1967)\, and Nashville Rebel (1967). Billboard named him the Number One Artist of 1969.   Even after James' number one streak ended in January 1972\, he continued to place high on the charts. The number two "Only Love Can Break a Heart" (a pop hit for Gene Pitney ten years earlier) was followed by the number ones "That's Why I Love You Like I Do" and -- after moving to Columbia in mid-1972 -- "When the Snow Is on the Roses." James' next chart-topping single\, "Is It Wrong (For Loving You)\," was released in March 1974\, and it began his last major run. He followed with four consecutive Top Ten hits\, "A Mi Esposa con Amor (To My Wife With Love)\," "A Little Bit South of Saskatoon\," "Little Band of Gold\," and "What in the World's Come Over You."   By the early '70s\, James had moved into producing and music publishing also; he oversaw three of Marie Osmond's albums and still managed occasional Top Tens himself. He picked up the prestigious award of Country Music's Male Artist of the Decade from Record World in 1977 and moved to the Monument label in 1979\, then to Dimension two years later. He retired in 1983\, and now raises cattle in Alabama.   ~ John Bush\, All Music Guide  PLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels\, Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

COL title VAL Sweet Sixteen COL performer VAL Chicken Shack	COL video title VAL Hello Stranger - The Supremes & The Four Tops COL channel name VAL MotownConnoisseur30 COL description VAL Here is another outstanding cover from the third duet album from The Supremes & The Four Tops entitled "Dynamite" from 1971.  Aside from Barbara Lewis' 1963 original\, I think this version is the best of all the covers ever done of the song. It is musical perfection.  Written by: Barbara Lewis Produced by: Bobby Taylor and Frank Wilson Track recorded: May 3\, 1971 Additional overdubs\, strings and horn sessions recorded in Los Angeles: Dates unknown Levi Stubbs lead vocal recorded: June 5\, 1971 & August 17\, 1971 Four Tops background vocals recorded: June 9\, 1971 Jean Terrell lead vocal recorded: June 10\, 1971 Supremes background vocals recorded: June 24\, 1971  This version is the best song on the entire LP and one of the best duets the groups did together over the three albums. Motown was foolish not to release this as a single. It screams hit and would have been one had Motown promoted it\, but at the time The Supremes and The Four Tops were no longer Motown's top priority. Nonetheless\, it still remains an incredible cover.  ****No copyright infringement intended****	0

I lay there in the sun And felt it caressing my face As I fell asleep And dreamed. I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie And that I was the star of the movie. This really blew my mind\, The fact that me\, An overfed\, long-haired\, leaping gnome\, Should be the star of a Hollywood movie. Hmm\, but there I was. I was taken to a place\, The hall of the mountain king. I stood high upon a mountain top\, Naked to the world\, In front of every kind of girl. There was long ones\, tall ones\, short ones\, brown ones\, Black ones\, round ones\, big ones\, crazy ones. Out of the middle Came a lady. She whispered in my ear Something crazy. She said\, Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl." I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back As she disappeared\, But soon she returned. In her hand was a bottle of wine\, In the other\, a glass. She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass And raised it to her lips And\, just before she drank it\, She said\, Take the wine\, take that girl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl." Take that pearl\, yeah. It's on girl\, all you gotta do is spill that wine\, spill that wine. Let me feel\, let me feel fine\, yeah\, yeah. Spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, take that pearl.	0

Al Hirt (1922-1999)\, trumpet\, with chorus and orchestra.  Recorded in RCA Victor's "Nashville Sound" Studio\, Nashville\, Tennessee.  Produced by Chet Atkins; recording engineer\, Chuck Seitz.  ----------------------------------------------------------- Al Hirt wurde als Sohn eines Polizeibeamten geboren; er war unter dem Namen ‚ÄûAl" oder ‚ÄûJumbo" bekannt. Im Alter von sechs Jahren begann er Trompete zu spielen und mit 16 war er beruflich Trompeter. Im Jahr 1940 ging er nach Cincinnati\, um am dortigen Musikkonservatorium  zu studieren.  Nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg spielte er in mehreren Swing-Big-Bands. W√§hrend der 1960er-Jahre galt Hirt neben Herb Alpert als einer der popul√§rsten Trompeter; er wurde ausgew√§hlt\, die Titelmusik zu der in den 1960er-Jahren laufenden TV-Show The Green Hornet einzuspielen. Dieses St√ºck wurde von Billy May arrangiert\, wobei das Thema auf Nikolai Rimski-Korsakows ‚ÄûHummelflug" basiert\, und bewies Hirts technische Raffinesse. Das St√ºck erlangte wieder an Popularit√§t\, als es 2003 bei Quentin Tarantinos Film Kill Bill Teil des Soundtracks wurde. In New Orleans f√ºhrte er einige Jahre einen eigenen Club.  Hirt starb im Jahr 1999 an Leberversagen\, nachdem er einige Jahre aufgrund eines √ñdems im Rollstuhl verbracht hatte. ----------------------------------------------------------- Al Hirt - ameryka≈Ñski trƒôbacz jazzowy i kierownik zespo≈Çu muzycznego.  Studiowa≈Ç w konserwatorium w Cincinnati. Wystƒôpowa≈Ç jako pierwszy trƒôbacz w zespo≈Çach Tommy Dorseya\, Jimmy'ego Dorseya\, Raya McKinleya. Z racji swojej postury (wa≈ºy≈Ç 130 kg i mia≈Ç 183 cm wzrostu) nosi≈Ç przydomki: "The Monster" i "The King".  Najpopularniejsze nagrania: "Java"\, "Fancy Plants"\, "Just Because"\, "Personality"\, "Panama"\, "Jazz Mr. Blues"\, "Sugar Lips". ----------------------------------------------------------- Al Hirt √©tait le fils d'un officier de police. √Ä l'√¢ge de 6 ans\, il re√ßoit sa premi√®re trompette. Il joue dans le Junior Police Band avec les enfants d'Alcide Yellow Nunez et √† 16 ans\, Hirt joue en tant que professionnel\, souvent avec son ami Pete Fountain. Il est engag√© par un hippodrome voisin pour y jouer.  En 1940\, Hirt se d√©place √† Cincinnati dans l'Ohio pour √©tudier au Cincinnati Conservatory of Music aupr√®s du Dr. Frank Simon (un ancien soliste de l'orchestre de John Philip Sousa). Durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale\, Hirt joue du clairon dans l'arm√©e am√©ricaine\, puis il joue aux c√¥t√©s de plusieurs big bands de swing dont ceux de Tommy Dorsey\, Jimmy Dorsey\, Benny Goodman\, et Ina Rae Hutton. En 1950\, il devient le trompettiste principal de l'orchestre d'Horace Heidt.  Il retourne ensuite √† la Nouvelle-Orl√©ans o√π il aide et m√®ne plusieurs groupes de Dixieland. Malgr√© les d√©clarations de Hirt plusieurs ann√©es plus tard\, Je ne suis pas un trompettiste de jazz et ne fut jamais un trompettiste de jazz\, il enregistra quelques morceaux o√π il montra sa capacit√© √† jouer ce style durant les ann√©es 1950\, en particulier avec Monk Hazel. Il enregistra √©galement pour le label Southland Records.  La dext√©rit√© de Hirt et son style attira rapidement l'attention des labels nationaux. Hirt avait 22 albums dans les Billboard Pop charts durant les ann√©es 50 et 60. Les albums Honey In The Horn et Cotton Candy √©taient tous deux au sommet des charts des meilleures ventes de disque pour l'ann√©e 1964. La m√™me ann√©e\, Hirt r√©ussit √† atteindre le sommet du classement gr√¢ce au morceau Java.	0

COL title VAL Chan's Song COL performer VAL Eliane Elias	COL video title VAL Eugene Maslov-Chan's Song(Never Said)-2000 COL channel name VAL muzicminor25 COL description VAL A pretty quick follow-up to his first CD When I Need to Smile\, Face of Love finds Maslov incorporating guests Toots Thielemans on harmonica and Shirley Horn on vocals\, and interpreting jazz and pop music from '60s icons\, adding an occasional innocuous synth wash here and there. Eddie Gomez is back on bass for eight cuts\, and Willie Jones\, George Schuller\, and Steve Williams split up drum chores. Asserting himself as a pyrotechnist\, Maslov's fine original playing comes to the forefront; he injects hard chords and neat ideas into the up samba of Herbie Hancock and Stevie Wonder's "Chan's Song." The Miles Davis-Victor Feldman evergreen "Seven Steps to Heaven" is wittily arranged\, shifting back and forth from upbeat waltz to regular 4/4 pace. A most interesting version of the Jimmy Rowles number "The Peacocks" sports heavy\, dense textures from Gomez with Maslov's left piano hand and synth\, and slight funk by Jones. The trio dives head first with no intro into "Them There Eyes\," jump starts "The Groove Merchant" including a solo piano break\, and adopts a more contemporary samba mode for Maslov's "Through Russian Eyes." Horn sings two ballads written by Mack Street honcho Gretchen Carhartt\, the tick-tock rhythm on the unrequited love torch song of a title track\, and the regret-filled "Come Back to Me Love." Thielemans' features are the "Days of Wine & Roses"-flavored ballad "More Love" and the classic\, tender waltz "Bluesette." This CD is an improvement and a continuation along the lines of the previous recording. ~ Michael G. Nastos jazz pianist's 2nd release on Mack Avenue offers a superb selection of songs ranging from Herbie Hancock's "Never Said" to Miles Davis/Victor Feldman's "Seven Steps To Heaven\," as well as originals; inc. vocals by Grammy winner Shirley Horn\, feat. specia Recorded at Clinton Studios\, New York\, New York in May & June 1999.

Following their footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors\, Of silent desperation\, never speaking to a soul. The poison air he's breathing has the dirty smell of dying\, 'Cos it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain. But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes\, Of the clicking of the turnstiles and the rattle of his chains.  "Oh\," she said: "Casey\, it's been so long since I've seen you. "Here\," she said: "just a kiss to make a body smile. "See\," she said: "I've put on new stockings just to please you. "Lord\," she said. "Casey\, can you only stay a while."  Casey leaves the underground and stops inside The Golden Crown\, For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bones. Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men\, Who reach for anything they can to keep from going home. Standing in the corner\, Casey drinks his pint of bitter\, Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by. Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason\, Is the beer that's in his belly or the tear that's in his eye.  "Oh\," she said: "I suppose you seldom think about me. "Now\," she said: "now that you've a family of your own. "Still\," she said: "It's so blessed good to feel your body. "Lord\," she said: "Casey\, it's a shame to be alone."	0

COL title VAL I Sold My Heart to the Junkman COL performer VAL Chris Connor	COL video title VAL Dancing With Tears In My Eyes - Damita Jo '61 Mercury LP 60642 COL channel name VAL AMNON SUODAI COL description VAL Damita Jo DeBlanc (August 5\, 1930 ‚Äì December 25\, 1998)\,[1] a.k.a. Damita Jo\, was an American actress\, comedian\, and lounge music performer. DeBlanc was born in Austin\, Texas\,[2] the featured vocalist on recordings from Steve Gibson and the Red Caps during the 1950s.[3] She later went on to marry Gibson\, but they parted ways professionally and personally in 1959.  Credited as simply Damita Jo\, DeBlanc had some chart success in the early 1960s with two answer songs: 1960's "I'll Save the Last Dance for You" (an answer to "Save the Last Dance for Me") and 1961's "I'll Be There" (an answer to "Stand By Me"). Both songs were originally sung by Ben E. King and made the R&B top 20\, and "I'll Be There" also reached number 12 on the pop chart. In 1962 she recorded "Dance With a Dolly (With a Hole in her Stocking)"\, previously made famous by The Andrews Sisters and Bill Haley\, for Mercury Records. In 1966 she had a minor hit with a cover of the Jacques Brel song "If You Go Away."  She worked with Ray Charles\, Count Basie\, and Lionel Hampton. And\, in 1963\, she released a recording for Mercury Records with Billy Eckstine and Bobby Tucker Orchestra.  Damita Jo was later involved in comedy and toured with Redd Foxx. In 1998\, she suffered a respiratory illness and died on Christmas Day[2] in Baltimore\, Maryland.	0

COL title VAL Mae Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau (Land of My Fathers) COL performer VAL Only Men Aloud	COL video title VAL Johnny Mathis ~ On My Way to You COL channel name VAL lenoremewton COL description VAL Yet another stirring marriage of the gifts of Johnny Mathis\, Marilyn and Alan Bergman and Michel Legrand. "On My Way to You"\, released on the 1993 CD "How Do You Keep the Music Playing"\, is expressed with delicate sensitivity and a rich blending of these incredible four emissaries of song: the Bergman's poetic lyrics\, Michel Legrand's passionate composition and arrangement - all brought to life through Johnny's empathic\, intimate and deep interpretation of love's journey. To quote the Bergman's (liner notes) : "(Johnny) makes all within the sound of it feel as though he is singing just to them...... And it's a voice that keeps getting better- wiser\, more knowing\, more moving".  Only to repeat myself- this CD is such a treasure to own- each song inviting you to a place of 'dream-like' memory. Please enjoy.  --	0

COL title VAL Bras dessus\, bras dessous COL performer VAL Les compagnons de la chanson	COL video title VAL Ruby Wright - Bimbo COL channel name VAL AFantasticVoyage COL description VAL VARIOUS: THEN 1954  1954 -- now\, that's what we call an exceptional year! Perhaps best remembered in Britain for the end of rationing after 14 years\, 1954 also saw the marriage of Marilyn Monroe to Joe Di Maggio\, the first royal tour of Australia\, the breaking of the four-minute mile by runner Roger Bannister\, and the first World Cup to be televised.  Much memorable music was also made that year\, and you can hear many of the most popular hits from back then right now on THEN 1954\, continuing the new series from Fantastic Voyage\, the label that brings you the highly popular British Hit Parade compilations. Unlike that series\, which provides two multi-disc sets per year intended for the serious chart completists out there\, the THEN series has the more casual music buyer in mind.  Although THEN 1953 includes many UK and US chart-toppers\, the series is not constrained by chart position or label in its aim of presenting the most memorable sounds of each year. Successive volumes of THEN will follow over the coming months. Each one is compiled and annotated by eminent chartwatcher Dave McAleer\, the former chief consultant and contributor to the now defunct Guinness Book Of British Hit Singles\, who is currently devising pop quiz books for the Official Charts Company and assisting with the Virgin Book Of British Hit Albums.  Dave's sleeve notes spend as much time recalling the news events of the year as they do exploring the musical highlights. If you are looking to build up a library of the most enduring British hits from each year\, THEN is the series for you. If you are looking for a souvenir of a particular year -- to remember a birth\, a first kiss\, or a wedding -- THEN will provide the soundtrack to those memories.	0

COL title VAL Bigmouth Strikes Again COL performer VAL Morrissey	COL video title VAL George Barnes -- Lady in Red COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL George Barnes era uno de los guitarristas m√°s prol√≠ficos y vers√°tiles de los a√±os cincuenta y sesenta. Aunque\, b√°sicamente era un hombre de jazz\, era un maestro de todos los estilos: blues\, country\, folk\, pop\, R & R\, R & B. Fue uno de los primeros en grabar con la guitarra el√©ctrica y Chet Atkins\, Les Paul y Charlie Christian le han citado como una fuente de inspiraci√≥n principal.  A la edad de 14 a√±os\, Barnes ya era un m√∫sico profesional y  hab√≠a formado su propio cuarteto George Barnes. Dos a√±os m√°s tarde grab√≥ sus primeros discos consu propio nombre: "I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles" and "I Can't Believe That You're In Love With Me" para el sello Okeh. En 1938 estaba trabajando para la NBC\, como director de orquesta\, guitarrista y arreglista. Tras su paso por el ej√©rcito durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial\, Barnes volvi√≥ a su trabajo de estudio y grab√≥ transcripciones de radio con su octeto inusual.  En 1951 se traslad√≥ de Chicago a Nueva York\, donde de inmediato consigui√≥ un contrato con Decca para grabar sus propios √°lbumes. George tambi√©n se reuni√≥ con Carl Kress en 1951\, el comienzo de una amistad que iba a dar lugar a una  formaci√≥n aclamada por la cr√≠tica. Recorrieron el mundo juntos e hicieron algunas de las mejores grabaciones de d√∫os de guitarra de la historia.  En este tiempo\, George ten√≠a  la Guild Guitar Company dedicada a construir una guitarra √∫nica bajo sus especificaciones. Tras la muerte de Kress en 1965\, la  pr√≥xima pareja de George iba a ser Bucky Pizzarelli. Como m√∫sico de estudio\, Barnes ha trabajado con todos\, desde Louis Armstrong a Bob Dylan.  iTunes: http://itunes.apple.com/es/album/guitar-galaxies/id476374761  S√≠guenos en: Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/vintagem.es Spotify: http://open.spotify.com/user/vintagemusic Web: http://www.vintagemusic.es BoutiqAlia: http://boutiqalia.com/store/vintage/ (compra f√≠sica de CD) Compra nuestros Cd's en formato f√≠sico en estas plataformas: Ebay:  http://stores.ebay.com/VintageMusicFm BoutiqAlia: www.boutiqalia-vintagemusic.com S√≠guenos en: Spotify: https://goo.gl/raouHQ Facebook: https://goo.gl/L92BHL Instagram: https://goo.gl/3oYDGH Web: http://www.vintagemusic.es   Compra nuestros Cd's en formato f√≠sico en estas plataformas: Ebay:  http://stores.ebay.com/VintageMusicFm BoutiqAlia: www.boutiqalia-vintagemusic.com Discogs: https://www.discogs.com/es/seller/vintagemusicfm/profile	0

Don't sent your kinfolk to give me no talkin' I'll be gone\, like I said.  You'd just say the same old thing That you be sayin' all along\, Just lay there in your bed and keep your mouth shut\, Till I'm gone. Don't give me that old familiar cry and fuss and moan  Understand your man\, I'm tired of your bad-mouthin' Understand your man.  You can give my other suit to the Salvation Army\, And everything else I leave behind I ain't takin' nothin' that'll slow down my travelin' While I'm untanglin' my mind.  I ain't gonna repeat What I said any more While I'm breathin' air that ain't been breathed before\, I'll be just as gone as the wild goose in winter  Then you'll understand your man\, meditate on it Understand your man\, you hear me talking Understand your man. Remember what I told you Understand your man Understand your man Written by Johnny R.

From Wikipedia\, the free encyclopedia "Understand Your Man" is a 1964 single by Johnny Cash.[1] The single went to number one on the country charts for six weeks.[2] "Understand Your Man" also crossed over to the Top 40\, peaking at number 35.[3]  Cash borrowed parts of the melody from Bob Dylan's "Don't Think Twice\, It's All Right".[4]  "Understand Your Man" was also the last song Cash ever performed in front of an audience. It was the last song in his performance at the Carter Family Fold in Hiltons\, Virginia\, on 5 July 2003. Prior to singing it\, Cash told the audience that at that point he had not performed it live in 25 years. (It was not\, however\, the final song he ever sang as despite failing health he continued to make studio recordings until late August 2003\, shortly before his death.)

'Spirit of '73: Rock For Choice' was put together by the activist group Feminist Majority with proceeds going to support the Becky Bell/Rosie Jimenez Campaign "to lift consent laws and federal funding restrictions that are forcing young women to turn to back-alley abortions".

COL title VAL I Take What I Want COL performer VAL The Tremeloes	COL video title VAL The Tune Weavers - Happy Happy Birthday Baby COL channel name VAL John1948ThirteenA COL description VAL The Tune Weavers were a vocal group that originally did not sing R & B tunes\, or even rock & roll tunes\, or were even called The Tune Weavers. They began as a jazz-pop duo consisting of brother and sister Gilbert and Margo Lopez who favored tunes by Mel Torme\, Jackie and Roy\, and of course Frank Sinatra. In 1956 the duo added two more voices - Margo's husband John Sylvia and her cousin Charlotte Davis. The newly formed quartet were called The Tone Weavers and now did versions of songs in the style of The Four Freshmen and Lambert\, Hendricks\, and Ross. By now the four members had started to add some R & B tunes to their performances. They soon came to the attention of a local record man named Frank Paul who owned a small local label called Casa Grande Records. He agreed to hear the group and was not too impressed until he heard them vocalize on an original tune written by Margo called "Happy Happy Birthday Baby". She had penned the tune a few years before and nothing had become of this song until now. A recording session was set up and in March of 1957 "Happy Happy Birthday Baby" was recorded along with the Broadway show tune standard "Ol Man River" and soon released on Casa Grande # 4037.  The record was a dud and went nowhere. This was the problem with so many records put out by small independent labels due to the lack of distribution added to inexperience in promotion. Three months went by as the group went back into the small clubs in the Boston area and thought about the failure of their first effort on record. Seemingly from out of nowhere\, two Philadelphia jocks - Joe Niagara and Hy Lit on WIBG\, started playing "Birthday"\, the record that had lain dormant all this time. Listeners ears perked up as the unique song was a grabber\, and soon that titan of pop in that city\, Dick Clark\, was also all ears. He was ready to lead his local teenage dance television show "American Bandstand"\, onto the national scene and here was a record that was about to break wide open. In mid August Chess Records from Chicago bought the distribution rights to the record from Casa Grande and released it on Checker # 872\, and gave it the national "push" that was needed. The record was well received by a varied cross section of listeners hooked by the melancholy lyrics and Margo's delivery with a resemblance to Patti Page. (There was one difference in the Casa Grande and Checker versions of the song. The original has a four note coda [ending] played by the tenor sax\, but the Checker version cuts this off after the last note of the vocal). By September the record was a national smash heading up to the top of the pop music charts. The group appears at Alan Freed's labor Day show at the Brooklyn Paramount headlined by Little Richard. The next month The Tune Weavers go out on their first national tour as part of a package show featuring Roy Hamilton\, The Clovers\, Doc Bagby\, Little Joe\, and others. They will tour the Southern states in a series of one nighters.  In November Al Silver\, head of Herald Records in New York\, announces that his label has bought the rights to Casa Grande masters by the group from Frank Paul. The exclusive distribution deal will be done by Silver's Ember label. Later that month "I Remember Dear" and "Pamela Jean" are released on Casa Grande # 4038\, making that label in effect\, a subsidiary of Herald-Ember. "I Remember Dear" sells initially but soon falters and dies not denting the national pop charts. In January of 1958 "There Stands My Love" and "I'm Cold" are released on Casa Grande # 4040 but goes nowhere. In March "Look Down That Lonesome Road" and "Little Boy" are issued by Casa Grande on # 101\, but this too is a failure in both sales and airplay. At this time Charlotte Davis left the group and was replaced by Bill Morris Jr.  There were two other record releases for the group in the early nineteen sixties. "My Congratulations Baby" was another attempt to mine the same ground as "Birthday" and was paired with "This Can't Be Love" on Casa Grande # 3038 in 1960\, and again with "Congratulations On Your Wedding" and "Your Skies of Blue" on Checker # 1007 in 1962. Margo Sylvia passed away in 1991 and Gil Lopez passed away in 1998.  ~ http://home.earthlink.net/~v1tiger/tweavers.html  PLEASE NOTE:  I divided my uploads among multiple channels\,  Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

Incredible orchestra and arrangement! Adapted from "Autumn Concerto" and also known as "And That Reminds Me". Kay's last Top 10 hit\, and her last Billboard charting single until "Foolin' Around" got to #49 in March 1961. This song also charted at #12 on the Hot 100 for Della Reese in August 1957\, #31 Adult Contemporary for Vikki Carr in 1966 and #45 on the Hot 100 for the Four Seasons in September 1969.   Original Billboard review: "Here's a sock performance by Kay Starr on a powerful dramatic ballad\, based on "Autumn Concerto". Lush\, big band backing is in keeping with sweeping effect of platter. Should pull plenty of jockey spins\, and could put gal back on charts."  Written by Camillo Bargoni\, Al Stillman & Paul Siegel.   B-side is "Flim Flam Flou".	0

He's underneath the window\, she's singing\, "Hey la\, my boyfriend's back. You shouldn't come around here singing up to people like that... Anyway\, what you gonna do about it?"  ROMEO: Juliet\, the dice was loaded from the start And I bet when you exploded into my heart And I forget I forget the movie song. When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong\, Juliet?  Come up on different streets\, they're both the streets of shame. Both dirty\, both mean\, yes\, in the dream it was just the same And I dreamed your dream for you and now your dream is real. How can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals?

I can't do the talk\, like the talk on TV And I can't do a love song\, like the way it's meant to be. I can't do everything\, but I'll do anything for you. I can't do anything\, 'cept be in love with you! And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be. All I do is keep the beat... and bad company. Now all I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme\, Juliet\, I'd do the stars with you any time!  Juliet\, when we made love you used to cry. You said\, "I love you like the stars above\, I'll love you 'til I die". There's a place for us\, you know the movie song. When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong\, Juliet?

COL title VAL Havin' a Party COL performer VAL The Supremes	COL video title VAL Johnny Mathis ~ On My Way to You COL channel name VAL lenoremewton COL description VAL Yet another stirring marriage of the gifts of Johnny Mathis\, Marilyn and Alan Bergman and Michel Legrand. "On My Way to You"\, released on the 1993 CD "How Do You Keep the Music Playing"\, is expressed with delicate sensitivity and a rich blending of these incredible four emissaries of song: the Bergman's poetic lyrics\, Michel Legrand's passionate composition and arrangement - all brought to life through Johnny's empathic\, intimate and deep interpretation of love's journey. To quote the Bergman's (liner notes) : "(Johnny) makes all within the sound of it feel as though he is singing just to them...... And it's a voice that keeps getting better- wiser\, more knowing\, more moving".  Only to repeat myself- this CD is such a treasure to own- each song inviting you to a place of 'dream-like' memory. Please enjoy.  --	0

COL title VAL Your Precious Love COL performer VAL Avant and Keke Wyatt	COL video title VAL Eric Burdon and War  -  Spill the Wine (1970 ) COL channel name VAL jmms429 COL description VAL Studio version\, lyrics\, pics.  http://www.ericburdon.com http://www.lowriderband.com  I was once out strolling one very hot\, summer's day When I thought I'd lay myself down to rest In a big field of tall grass. I lay there in the sun And felt it caressing my face As I fell asleep And dreamed. I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie And that I was the star of the movie. This really blew my mind\, The fact that me\, An overfed\, long-haired\, leaping gnome\, Should be the star of a Hollywood movie. Hmm\, but there I was. I was taken to a place\, The hall of the mountain king. I stood high upon a mountain top\, Naked to the world\, In front of every kind of girl. There was long ones\, tall ones\, short ones\, brown ones\, Black ones\, round ones\, big ones\, crazy ones. Out of the middle Came a lady. She whispered in my ear Something crazy. She said\, Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl." I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back As she disappeared\, But soon she returned. In her hand was a bottle of wine\, In the other\, a glass. She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass And raised it to her lips And\, just before she drank it\, She said\, Take the wine\, take that girl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl." Take that pearl\, yeah. It's on girl\, all you gotta do is spill that wine\, spill that wine. Let me feel\, let me feel fine\, yeah\, yeah. Spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, take that pearl.	0

This song\, Jimmy Brown the Newsboy\, features Earl on lead guitar.  Earl said that he learned a lot about guitar from his friend and neighbor\, Mama Maybelle Carter. His style is very similar\, except for finger movement. Enjoy!

Best know for their international hit "Blue (Da Ba Dee)" Eiffel 65's debut album "Europop" sold over two million units in the US\, making them the best selling Italian eurodance group ever in the United States. The origin of the group's name is an interesting sequence of chance. The name "Eiffel" was chosen randomly by a computer program and the "65" was scribbled onto their name on a demo by mistake; it was actually part of a phone number. The group Eiffel 65 is also known for their many remixes of songs from other artists\, with over thirty of them to their name. In 2005 Gabriele Ponte left the group to focus on his solo career and in 2006 the reminding members left the Bliss Corporation to form their own duo called Bloom 06. The Bliss Corporation\, who owns the name Eiffel 65\, had announced a new line up for the group would be debuting in the summer of 2007 however the debut was postponed until further notice.	0

COL title VAL Dis Here COL performer VAL Jake Langley	COL video title VAL Eugene Maslov-Chan's Song(Never Said)-2000 COL channel name VAL muzicminor25 COL description VAL A pretty quick follow-up to his first CD When I Need to Smile\, Face of Love finds Maslov incorporating guests Toots Thielemans on harmonica and Shirley Horn on vocals\, and interpreting jazz and pop music from '60s icons\, adding an occasional innocuous synth wash here and there. Eddie Gomez is back on bass for eight cuts\, and Willie Jones\, George Schuller\, and Steve Williams split up drum chores. Asserting himself as a pyrotechnist\, Maslov's fine original playing comes to the forefront; he injects hard chords and neat ideas into the up samba of Herbie Hancock and Stevie Wonder's "Chan's Song." The Miles Davis-Victor Feldman evergreen "Seven Steps to Heaven" is wittily arranged\, shifting back and forth from upbeat waltz to regular 4/4 pace. A most interesting version of the Jimmy Rowles number "The Peacocks" sports heavy\, dense textures from Gomez with Maslov's left piano hand and synth\, and slight funk by Jones. The trio dives head first with no intro into "Them There Eyes\," jump starts "The Groove Merchant" including a solo piano break\, and adopts a more contemporary samba mode for Maslov's "Through Russian Eyes." Horn sings two ballads written by Mack Street honcho Gretchen Carhartt\, the tick-tock rhythm on the unrequited love torch song of a title track\, and the regret-filled "Come Back to Me Love." Thielemans' features are the "Days of Wine & Roses"-flavored ballad "More Love" and the classic\, tender waltz "Bluesette." This CD is an improvement and a continuation along the lines of the previous recording. ~ Michael G. Nastos jazz pianist's 2nd release on Mack Avenue offers a superb selection of songs ranging from Herbie Hancock's "Never Said" to Miles Davis/Victor Feldman's "Seven Steps To Heaven\," as well as originals; inc. vocals by Grammy winner Shirley Horn\, feat. specia Recorded at Clinton Studios\, New York\, New York in May & June 1999.

This album garnered wide airplay across Canada. The single "Record Body Count" was a significant hit for the band on Canadian alternative rock stations and MuchMusic in 1991.  The song "You Are Very Star"\, a bonus track on the CD release\, ends with a hockey announcer's narration in which the band is presented as a hockey team competing for the league's top ranking against 13 Engines\, Scott B. Sympathy and Tom Cochrane.  In 1996\, the Canadian music magazine Chart conducted a reader poll to determine the best Canadian albums of all time. Melville placed 16th in that poll. When the magazine conducted a follow up poll in 2000\, Melville placed fifth\, behind only Joni Mitchell\, Neil Young\, Sloan and Rheostatics' 1992 album Whale Music. In the magazine's third poll in 2005\, Melville placed 44th\, but was one of only 25 albums to have placed in the Top 50 in all three polls.	0

When I first heard what she does with her voice at the end of this song\, I couldn't believe my ears. When she transposed on the word "Cry"\, my disbelief grew\, and when that final note came I thought: surely\, she isn't gonna....? But she did. And she did it in such a heart-wrenching way that it left me completely gutted. Every time I've listened to it since\, it has given me goosebumps all over. Not only is her vocal bordering on the insane technically\,  it also drips with emotion and that's what makes her a true singer. Sorry for gushing.  Sadly\, her later re-recordings of the song don't come close to this\, in my opinion.	0

Both dirty\, both mean\, yes\, in the dream it was just the same And I dreamed your dream for you and now your dream is real. How can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals?

COL title VAL I Can't Go for That COL performer VAL The Bird and the Bee	COL video title VAL Eugene Maslov-Chan's Song(Never Said)-2000 COL channel name VAL muzicminor25 COL description VAL A pretty quick follow-up to his first CD When I Need to Smile\, Face of Love finds Maslov incorporating guests Toots Thielemans on harmonica and Shirley Horn on vocals\, and interpreting jazz and pop music from '60s icons\, adding an occasional innocuous synth wash here and there. Eddie Gomez is back on bass for eight cuts\, and Willie Jones\, George Schuller\, and Steve Williams split up drum chores. Asserting himself as a pyrotechnist\, Maslov's fine original playing comes to the forefront; he injects hard chords and neat ideas into the up samba of Herbie Hancock and Stevie Wonder's "Chan's Song." The Miles Davis-Victor Feldman evergreen "Seven Steps to Heaven" is wittily arranged\, shifting back and forth from upbeat waltz to regular 4/4 pace. A most interesting version of the Jimmy Rowles number "The Peacocks" sports heavy\, dense textures from Gomez with Maslov's left piano hand and synth\, and slight funk by Jones. The trio dives head first with no intro into "Them There Eyes\," jump starts "The Groove Merchant" including a solo piano break\, and adopts a more contemporary samba mode for Maslov's "Through Russian Eyes." Horn sings two ballads written by Mack Street honcho Gretchen Carhartt\, the tick-tock rhythm on the unrequited love torch song of a title track\, and the regret-filled "Come Back to Me Love." Thielemans' features are the "Days of Wine & Roses"-flavored ballad "More Love" and the classic\, tender waltz "Bluesette." This CD is an improvement and a continuation along the lines of the previous recording. ~ Michael G. Nastos jazz pianist's 2nd release on Mack Avenue offers a superb selection of songs ranging from Herbie Hancock's "Never Said" to Miles Davis/Victor Feldman's "Seven Steps To Heaven\," as well as originals; inc. vocals by Grammy winner Shirley Horn\, feat. specia Recorded at Clinton Studios\, New York\, New York in May & June 1999.

I've only added the footage as a tribute for historical\, entertainment\, and creative purposes with no financial gain. Copyright infringement not intended.  The Four Tunes "I Sold My Heart To The Junkman" Jubilee 5174 A 1954  Here are The Four Tunes with their version of "I Sold My Heart To The Junkman." This is the 2nd pressing that was released in 1954 by Jubilee\, in the same year as the 1st pressing. A nice\, minty\, clean 78 for your enjoyment.  The 4 Tunes were probably the leading black Pop vocal group during the 1950s. Their origins can be traced back to a change of personnel in the Ink Spots. This requires a brief review of some events in the mid-40s. In June 1944\, during an engagement in Chicago\, Hoppy Jones became ill and the group had to finish a tour without him (Deek Watson filled in on the mandatory talking parts). This had unsuspected ramifications. Hoppy was the conciliatory father figure (nicknamed "the grand old man") of the Ink Spots. Now that he was missing\, infighting between Bill Kenny and Deek Watson\, which had formerly just smoldered\, now flared up unchecked. Deek had been the leader of the group until their 1939 smash of "If I Didn't Care." Since then\, Bill had firmly established himself in the forefront of the Ink Spots\, pushing Deek further and further into the background. Hoppy returned in August\, but by then\, the damage had been done.  When he announced (in the January 1945 settlement of the lawsuits) that he would form a new group based "on a completely new idea\," he simply changed their name to the "Brown Dots" (the name does sound somewhat familiar\, doesn't it?). As it turned out\, the "new idea" was to sound as much like the Ink Spots as possible. One real difference was that the Brown Dots relied more on harmony than the Ink Spots\, who were more individualists. (Since the Brown Dots were also managed by Moe Gale\, we know who the hands-down winner in this contest was.)  The polished style of the 4 Tunes was the product of their training\, experience\, dedication\, and discipline. Their songs were carefully selected and arranged. Their first arranger was pianist Ralph Herman\, who was the youngest member of Paul Whiteman's Orchestra. They also worked with Howard Biggs (whose most famous association was with the Ravens).  In mid-1953\, they once again changed labels (since they weren't making any royalties from RCA). This time they went to Jerry Blaine's Jubilee label\, where they achieved their greatest popularity. Their first Jubilee recording\, "Marie\," was released in September\, and reached #2 on the R&B charts (#13 Pop). This Irving Berlin tune had been a #1 smash for Tommy Dorsey (Jack Leonard on vocal) back in 1937. ("Marie" was such a big hit that the purely R&B Dominoes and Larks were pushed to sing in the same kind of Pop mold.) Their next Jubilee release\, "I Understand Just How You Feel" was an even bigger hit\, climbing to #6 on the Pop charts (#7 R&B).  1954 saw two releases on the Kay-Ron label. These were old Manor cuts (although different takes). Two of them were backups to Savannah Churchill ("Savannah Sings The Blues" and "I Want To Be Loved"). The other two were "Just In Case You Change Your Mind" (which was actually by the Brown Dots) and "I Understand" (which was presumably released to confuse record buyers into thinking it was the same song as the current "I Understand Just How You Feel").  On Jubilee\, the 4 Tunes were primarily a Pop group (although they did turn out something called "Rock N Roll Call"). Their output included "Don't Cry Darling\," "L'amour\, Toujours L'amour\," "I Sold My Heart To The Junkman\," "Time Out For Tears\," "You Are My Love\," "Far Away Places\," "Dancing With Tears In My Eyes\," "Sayonara\," and "A Little On The Lonely Side."  The 4 Tunes appeared for a week at the Apollo Theater (beginning April 2\, 1955)\, along with Red Prysock's Orchestra. They played both the black theater circuit and also many white clubs. When they were on a tour with Joni James\, she asked Jimmie Nabbie to write a song for her. The result\, "You Are My Love\," was her big hit of 1955 (which the 4 Tunes covered).  In 1955\, the 4 Tunes were booked into the Hacienda in Las Vegas on a handshake\, and stayed for eight years. Other members\, added at the time\, were Smiley Hightower (guitar and bassist) and Eddie Williams (bassist; formerly of Johnny Moore's Three Blazers). Also\, tenor Billy Wells (from Deek's second Brown Dots group) was hired so that each of the other members could go on vacation on a rotating basis.   Turntable used: Audio Technica AT-LP120 USB Direct Drive inputted straight into the sound card using the built-in pre-amp from the turntable.  Cartridge used: ATP-2XN using 78 3 mil needle.	0

This album garnered wide airplay across Canada. The single "Record Body Count" was a significant hit for the band on Canadian alternative rock stations and MuchMusic in 1991.  The song "You Are Very Star"\, a bonus track on the CD release\, ends with a hockey announcer's narration in which the band is presented as a hockey team competing for the league's top ranking against 13 Engines\, Scott B. Sympathy and Tom Cochrane.  In 1996\, the Canadian music magazine Chart conducted a reader poll to determine the best Canadian albums of all time. Melville placed 16th in that poll. When the magazine conducted a follow up poll in 2000\, Melville placed fifth\, behind only Joni Mitchell\, Neil Young\, Sloan and Rheostatics' 1992 album Whale Music. In the magazine's third poll in 2005\, Melville placed 44th\, but was one of only 25 albums to have placed in the Top 50 in all three polls.	0

Paroles et musique: Ray Davies\, 1968   Who'll be the next in line? Who'll be the next in line for heartaches? Who'll make the same mistakes I made over you? Who'll be the next in line?

Autry was also owner of a television station\, several radio stations in Southern California\, and the Los Angeles/California/Anaheim Angels Major League Baseball team from 1961 to 1997.  From 1934 to 1953\, Autry appeared in 93 films and 91 episodes of The Gene Autry Show television series. During the 1930s and 1940s\, he personified the straight-shooting hero‚Äîhonest\, brave\, and true‚Äîand profoundly touched the lives of millions of Americans. Autry was also one of the most important figures in the history of country music\, considered the second major influential artist of the genre's development after Jimmie Rodgers.[2] His singing cowboy movies were the first vehicle to carry country music to a national audience. ] In addition to his signature song\, "Back in the Saddle Again"\, Autry is still remembered for his Christmas holiday songs\, "Here Comes Santa Claus"\, which he wrote\, "Frosty the Snowman"\, and his biggest hit\, "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer".  Autry is a member of both the Country Music Hall of Fame and Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame\, and is the only person to be awarded stars in all five categories on the Hollywood Walk of Fame\, for film\, television\, music\, radio\, and live performance. The town of Gene Autry\, Oklahoma was named in his honor.	0

COL title VAL Love Don't Live Here Anymore COL performer VAL Nicole Henry	COL video title VAL David Cassidy - Daydreamer (Top of the Pops) COL channel name VAL ppm115 COL description VAL From the TOP OF THE POPS 500th Edition (tx 04/10/73)\, this specially-shot promo of David Cassidy's hit single Daydreamer features the singer performing on the tarmac at Heathrow Airport.  The edition of TotP this clip hails from is currently missing from the BBC archives. The clip only survives because it was featured on Australian ABC show GTK (Get To Know) in 1974. The GTK programme was retained in the ABC archives as a B&W 16mm kinescope\, hence the less-than-perfect quality. It has subsequently been aired on music show Rage. A copy has now been returned to the BBC.  The clip has been restored and the soundtrack replaced with the record version for audio clarity (Cassidy was miming in the clip anyway).

COL channel name VAL JUSTASITTINANDAROCK COL description VAL RARE OLDIES VIDEO WITH DAVE LAMBERT \, JON HENDRICKS & YOLANDA BAVAN ! The group formed in 1957 and recorded their first album Sing a Song of Basie for Paramount Records. The album featured versions of Count Basie standards and was successful enough that the Count Basie Orchestra collaborated with them on Sing Along With Basie (1959)\, which was awarded a Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 1998. Beginning in 1959\, the trio recorded three LPs with Columbia Records. Their song "Twisted\," featuring Ross's lyrics set to a Wardell Gray melody\, was featured in Woody Allen's Deconstructing Harry (1997) and has been covered by Joni Mitchell\, Bette Midler and others. Their High Flying won a Grammy Award for Best Performance by a Vocal Group in 1962. Lambert\, Hendricks & Ross were voted Best Vocal Group in the Down Beat Readers Poll from 1959 to 1963. Annie Ross left the group in 1962\, replaced by vocalist Yolande Bavan. The renamed Lambert\, Hendricks and Bavan made three live albums before disbanding in 1964. Lambert\, Hendricks and Bavan appeared at the 1962 Newport Jazz Festival\, and their performance of "Comin' Home" and "Moanin'" can be seen in Buddy Bregman's film The 1962 Newport Jazz Festival. The group was also known as Lambert\, Hendricks and Moss when Canadian jazz singer Anne Marie Moss briefly replaced Annie Ross. Any hopes of a reunion of the original trio ended with Lambert's 1966 death in a car accident. You can watch all my rare oldies soundies on : http://www.myspace.com/swingcocktail !

COL title VAL 1913 Massacre COL performer VAL Ethan Daniel Davidson	COL video title VAL Al Hirt: Up Above My Head COL channel name VAL davidhertzberg1 COL description VAL From the LP "Sugar Lips\," issued in 1964 by RCA (LPM-2965\, monaural).  Al Hirt (1922-1999)\, trumpet\, with chorus and orchestra.  Recorded in RCA Victor's "Nashville Sound" Studio\, Nashville\, Tennessee.  Produced by Chet Atkins; recording engineer\, Chuck Seitz.  ----------------------------------------------------------- Al Hirt wurde als Sohn eines Polizeibeamten geboren; er war unter dem Namen ‚ÄûAl" oder ‚ÄûJumbo" bekannt. Im Alter von sechs Jahren begann er Trompete zu spielen und mit 16 war er beruflich Trompeter. Im Jahr 1940 ging er nach Cincinnati\, um am dortigen Musikkonservatorium  zu studieren.  Nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg spielte er in mehreren Swing-Big-Bands. W√§hrend der 1960er-Jahre galt Hirt neben Herb Alpert als einer der popul√§rsten Trompeter; er wurde ausgew√§hlt\, die Titelmusik zu der in den 1960er-Jahren laufenden TV-Show The Green Hornet einzuspielen. Dieses St√ºck wurde von Billy May arrangiert\, wobei das Thema auf Nikolai Rimski-Korsakows ‚ÄûHummelflug" basiert\, und bewies Hirts technische Raffinesse. Das St√ºck erlangte wieder an Popularit√§t\, als es 2003 bei Quentin Tarantinos Film Kill Bill Teil des Soundtracks wurde. In New Orleans f√ºhrte er einige Jahre einen eigenen Club.  Hirt starb im Jahr 1999 an Leberversagen\, nachdem er einige Jahre aufgrund eines √ñdems im Rollstuhl verbracht hatte. ----------------------------------------------------------- Al Hirt - ameryka≈Ñski trƒôbacz jazzowy i kierownik zespo≈Çu muzycznego.  Studiowa≈Ç w konserwatorium w Cincinnati. Wystƒôpowa≈Ç jako pierwszy trƒôbacz w zespo≈Çach Tommy Dorseya\, Jimmy'ego Dorseya\, Raya McKinleya. Z racji swojej postury (wa≈ºy≈Ç 130 kg i mia≈Ç 183 cm wzrostu) nosi≈Ç przydomki: "The Monster" i "The King".  Najpopularniejsze nagrania: "Java"\, "Fancy Plants"\, "Just Because"\, "Personality"\, "Panama"\, "Jazz Mr. Blues"\, "Sugar Lips". ----------------------------------------------------------- Al Hirt √©tait le fils d'un officier de police. √Ä l'√¢ge de 6 ans\, il re√ßoit sa premi√®re trompette. Il joue dans le Junior Police Band avec les enfants d'Alcide Yellow Nunez et √† 16 ans\, Hirt joue en tant que professionnel\, souvent avec son ami Pete Fountain. Il est engag√© par un hippodrome voisin pour y jouer.  En 1940\, Hirt se d√©place √† Cincinnati dans l'Ohio pour √©tudier au Cincinnati Conservatory of Music aupr√®s du Dr. Frank Simon (un ancien soliste de l'orchestre de John Philip Sousa). Durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale\, Hirt joue du clairon dans l'arm√©e am√©ricaine\, puis il joue aux c√¥t√©s de plusieurs big bands de swing dont ceux de Tommy Dorsey\, Jimmy Dorsey\, Benny Goodman\, et Ina Rae Hutton. En 1950\, il devient le trompettiste principal de l'orchestre d'Horace Heidt.  Il retourne ensuite √† la Nouvelle-Orl√©ans o√π il aide et m√®ne plusieurs groupes de Dixieland. Malgr√© les d√©clarations de Hirt plusieurs ann√©es plus tard\, Je ne suis pas un trompettiste de jazz et ne fut jamais un trompettiste de jazz\, il enregistra quelques morceaux o√π il montra sa capacit√© √† jouer ce style durant les ann√©es 1950\, en particulier avec Monk Hazel. Il enregistra √©galement pour le label Southland Records.  La dext√©rit√© de Hirt et son style attira rapidement l'attention des labels nationaux. Hirt avait 22 albums dans les Billboard Pop charts durant les ann√©es 50 et 60. Les albums Honey In The Horn et Cotton Candy √©taient tous deux au sommet des charts des meilleures ventes de disque pour l'ann√©e 1964. La m√™me ann√©e\, Hirt r√©ussit √† atteindre le sommet du classement gr√¢ce au morceau Java.	0

This song was released earlier on the Junior label\, same version & same flip-side. Before the group became The Silhouettes they were known as The Gospel Tornadoes when they sang in churches on Sundays. When they sang in nightclubs during the rest of the week they were known as The Thunderbirds.  Kae Williams a local disc jockey (WDAS) and the owner of Junior records named the group after The Rays 1957 hit single on Cameo 117 "Silhouettes". Kae Williams refused to release The Silhouettes version of "For Your Precious Love" which they cut while on the road after hearing Jerry Butler & The Impressions version\, due to his friendship with Abner records executive Ewart Abner.

COL title VAL Bewildered COL performer VAL Ink Spots	COL video title VAL Roots of Blues  Mississippi John Hurt ‚ÄûCandy Man Blues COL channel name VAL Literatisch COL description VAL ‚ÄûCandy Man Blues (J. Hurt)  Recorded: New York City\, December 28\,1928 Mississippi John Hurt (vcl)(g).  Born John Smith Hurt in Teoc\,  Carroll County\, Mississippi and raised in Avalon\, Mississippi\, Hurt learned to play guitar at age 9. He spent much of his youth playing old time music for friends and dances\, earning a living as a farm hand into the 1920s. In 1923 he partnered with the fiddle player Willie Narmour as a substitute for his regular partner Shell Smith. When Narmour got a chance to record for Okeh Records as a prize for winning first place in a 1928 fiddle contest\, Narmour recommended John Hurt to Okeh Records producer Tommy Rockwell. After auditioning "Monday Morning Blues" at his home\, he took part in two recording sessions\, in Memphis and New York City (see Discography below). The "Mississippi" tag was added by Okeh as a sales gimmick. After the commercial failure of the resulting records\, and Okeh Records going out of business during the Great Depression\, Hurt returned to Avalon and obscurity\, working as a sharecropper and playing local parties and dances.  In 1963\, however\, a folk musicologist\, Tom Hoskins\, inspired by the recordings\, was able to locate Hurt near Avalon\, Mississippi. Seeing that Hurt's guitar playing skills were still intact\, Hoskins encouraged him to move to Washington\, D.C.\, and begin performing on a wider stage. His performance at the 1964 Newport Folk Festival saw his star rise amongst the new folk revival audience. Before his death he played extensively in colleges\, concert halls\, coffee houses and also on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson\, as well as recording three further albums for Vanguard Records. The numbers his devotees particularly liked were the ragtime songs "Salty Dog" and "Candy Man"\, and the blues ballads "Spike Driver Blues" (a variant of "John Henry") and "Frankie".  Hurt's influence spanned several music genres including blues\, country\, bluegrass\, folk and contemporary rock and roll. A soft-spoken man\, his nature was reflected in the work\, which remained a mellow mix of country\, blues and old time music to the end.[7]  Hurt died in November 1966 from a heart attack in Grenada\, Mississippi	0

COL title VAL Mr. Magic (Through the Smoke) COL performer VAL Amy Winehouse	COL video title VAL The Crazy World of Arthur Brown-Fire  (1968) COL channel name VAL elodd90 COL description VAL "Fire" is a 1968 song by Arthur Brown\, Vincent Crane\, Mike Finesilver and Peter Ker. Performed by the Crazy World of Arthur Brown\, it was released as a single and on the band's debut album\, also called The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. The single made #1 in the UK (in August 1968) and Canada. In October\, it made #2 in the US Billboard charts and #19 in Australia. It also made number 6 in The Netherlands.  The song is an example of the psychedelic rock of the period\, though its lack of guitars distinguished it from many of its contemporaries. The lead instrument in this case was Vincent Crane's Hammond electronic organ\, augmented by an orchestral section featuring prominent brass. The singer's opening proclamation of himself as "the god of hellfire" became a lasting epithet.  *i posted this video only for entertainment purposes*	0
COL title VAL Mama Weer All Crazee Now COL performer VAL Slade	COL video title VAL Eiffel 65 - Blue (Da Ba Dee) COL channel name VAL malawolf85 COL description VAL Eiffel 65 is a three man (Gianfranco Randone\, Maurizio Lobina\, and Gabriele Ponte) Italian eurodance group. Best know for their international hit "Blue (Da Ba Dee)" Eiffel 65's debut album "Europop" sold over two million units in the US\, making them the best selling Italian eurodance group ever in the United States. The origin of the group's name is an interesting sequence of chance. The name "Eiffel" was chosen randomly by a computer program and the "65" was scribbled onto their name on a demo by mistake; it was actually part of a phone number. The group Eiffel 65 is also known for their many remixes of songs from other artists\, with over thirty of them to their name. In 2005 Gabriele Ponte left the group to focus on his solo career and in 2006 the reminding members left the Bliss Corporation to form their own duo called Bloom 06. The Bliss Corporation\, who owns the name Eiffel 65\, had announced a new line up for the group would be debuting in the summer of 2007 however the debut was postponed until further notice.	0

At the dawn of the new millennium\, songwriter\, producer\, and multi- instrumentalist Klayton created Celldweller\, a ground-breaking aural entity for the next age. Thriving on originality\, Celldweller cross-bred electronic styles such as Drum'n'Bass and Psy-Trance with modern Alternative Rock and Metal on his self-titled debut\, released independently in 2003.  The Celldweller album met with critical acclaim while climbing to #17 on the Billboard Internet Sales Chart. Celldweller gained Top 40 Metal Radio charting with the track "I Believe You" pulling into a solid 11th place on the R&R Alternative Specialty Show Chart. Achieving a feat shared by only an elite handful of albums\, every song on Celldweller was eventually licensed for use in popular media. These songs were heard in movie trailers\, TV shows\, and games such as Spider Man 2\, Constantine\, Crackdown\, Need for Speed: Most Wanted\, Enter the Matrix\, CSI\, UFC\, The Shield\, and more.  Now\, Celldweller has been reissued to celebrate the tenth anniversary of its release with updated artwork and a second disc of remixes\, demos\, and previously unheard rarities (all remastered for this release). While Klayton busies himself in his Detroit studio preparing the future of Celldweller for 2013\, celebrate the past with this monumental work.  Want to use FiXT music in your YouTube videos?

COL title VAL The Letter Edged in Black COL performer VAL Slim Whitman	COL video title VAL Archie Bell & The Drells - Tighten up (1968) COL channel name VAL Moraito COL description VAL "Tighten Up" was a 1968 song by Houston\, Texas based R&B vocal group Archie Bell & the Drells. It reached #1 on both the Billboard R&B and pop charts in the spring of 1968. It is ranked #265 on the Rolling Stone magazine's list of "the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time" and is one of the earliest funk hits in music history. "Tighten Up" was written by Archie Bell and Billy Buttier. It was one of the first songs that Archie Bell & the Drells recorded\, in a session in 1967\, along with a number of songs including "She's My Woman". Soon afterwards Bell was drafted into the U.S. Army and began serving in Vietnam. The song became a hit in Houston\, and was picked up by Atlantic Records for distribution in April 1968. By the summer it topped both the Billboard R&B and pop charts. It also sold a million copies by May 1968\, gaining an R.I.A.A. gold disc. The line in "Tighten Up"\, "we dance just as good as we walk" was a little ironic\, given that Bell had been shot in the leg and was consigned to a military hospital bed at the time.  The introduction features Bell introducing himself as being from Houston\, Texas. According to the Billboard Book of Number One Hits by Fred Bronson\, Bell heard a comment after the Kennedy assassination in Dallas\, that "nothing good ever came out of Texas." Bell wanted his listeners to know "we were from Texas and we were good."  The song described an accompanying dance that the band had invented\, also called the "Tighten Up"; this dance became popular concurrently with the song.  The phenomenal success of the single prompted the band to rush out an album\, despite their incapacitated leader. In 1969 the group recorded their first full album with Gamble and Huff\, I Can't Stop Dancing\, which reached number 28 on the R&B chart.

COL title VAL Goodbye for Now COL performer VAL Barbra Streisand	COL video title VAL Open the Door\, Richard (#1 hit version) - The Three Flames COL channel name VAL geofbrit59 COL description VAL Another version of "Open the Door Richard" by the Three Flames. A very popular late 1940's vocal group. They hosted their own TV show on NBC in 1949. One of only two #1 versions of "Open the Door Richard" it charted Feb. 1947. I'm adding this to clear up some misinformation about this song....  Clinton "Dusty" Fletcher was an African-American vaudeville performer. He created the "Open The Door Richard" routine. It was Jack McVea who put the routine to music and recorded it. It became a huge hit in the late 1940s and was covered by many different bands. Dusty Fletcher even released his own two sided disc of it.	0

COL title VAL Ich weiss nicht zu wem ich geh√∂re COL performer VAL Anna Sten mit Ilja Livschakoff Orchester	COL video title VAL Lightnin' Hopkins - Baby don't you tear my clothes COL channel name VAL frenzexperiment COL description VAL "Sam Hopkins was a Texas country bluesman of the highest caliber whose career began in the 1920s and stretched all the way into the 1980s. Along the way\, Hopkins watched the genre change remarkably\, but he never appreciably altered his mournful Lone Star sound\, which translated onto both acoustic and electric guitar. Hopkins' nimble dexterity made intricate boogie riffs seem easy\, and his fascinating penchant for improvising lyrics to fit whatever situation might arise made him a beloved blues troubadour."

COL title VAL Take Me in Your Arms (Rock Me a Little While) COL performer VAL Eddie Holland	COL video title VAL Hello Stranger - The Supremes & The Four Tops COL channel name VAL MotownConnoisseur30 COL description VAL Here is another outstanding cover from the third duet album from The Supremes & The Four Tops entitled "Dynamite" from 1971.  Aside from Barbara Lewis' 1963 original\, I think this version is the best of all the covers ever done of the song. It is musical perfection.  Written by: Barbara Lewis Produced by: Bobby Taylor and Frank Wilson Track recorded: May 3\, 1971 Additional overdubs\, strings and horn sessions recorded in Los Angeles: Dates unknown Levi Stubbs lead vocal recorded: June 5\, 1971 & August 17\, 1971 Four Tops background vocals recorded: June 9\, 1971 Jean Terrell lead vocal recorded: June 10\, 1971 Supremes background vocals recorded: June 24\, 1971  This version is the best song on the entire LP and one of the best duets the groups did together over the three albums. Motown was foolish not to release this as a single. It screams hit and would have been one had Motown promoted it\, but at the time The Supremes and The Four Tops were no longer Motown's top priority. Nonetheless\, it still remains an incredible cover.  ****No copyright infringement intended****	0

ALSO if like so many people think Pink Floyd is "untouchable" why do you have such high expectations of the song\, also a cover version is your own version\, if they did exactly the same thing people would just bitch about that too - So...  Shut Up - watch the video if you like it\, if u don't please leave constructive critism - instead of "this sux :("  Thank You :)  Lyrics  Come in here\, dear boy\, have a cigar. youre gonna go far\, fly high\, Youre never gonna die\, youre gonna make it if you try;theyre gonna love you. Well Ive always had a deep respect\, and I mean that most sincerely. The band is just fantastic\, that is really what I think. oh by the way\, Which ones pink?  And did we tell you the name of the game\, boy\, we call it riding the Gravy train.  Were just knocked out. we heard about the sell out. you gotta get an Album out\, You owe it to the people. were so happy we can hardly count. Everybody else is just green\, have you seen the chart?

Stan Kelly  Lyrics: Oh you are a mucky kid\, Dirty as a dustbin lid. When he hears the things you did\, You'll gerra belt from your Dad. Oh you have your father's nose\, So crimson in the dark it glows\, If you're not asleep when the boozers close\, You'll gerra belt from your Dad.   You look so scruffy lying dur Strawberry-jam tats in yer 'air\, Though in the world you haven't a care And I have got so many. It's quite a struggle every day Living on your father's pay\, The bugger drinks it all away And leaves me without any.   Although we have no silver spoon\, Better days are coming soon Now Nelly's working at the Lune And she gets paid on Friday. Perhaps one day we'll have a splash\, When Littlewoods provide the cash\, We'll get a house in Knotty Ash And buy your Dad a brewery.   Oh you are a mucky kid\, Dirty as a dustbin lid. When he hears the things you did You'll gerra belt from your Dad. Oh you have your father's face\, You're growing up a real hard case\, But there's no one can take your place\, .... Go fast asleep for yer Mammy.	0

They are best known for their million-selling 1971 single "Put Your Hand in the Hand"\, penned by Gene MacLellan.[1] The gramophone record sold over one million copies and received a gold disc awarded by the Recording Industry Association of America on 3 May 1971.[1] Ocean consisted of Greg Brown (vocals\, keyboard)\, Jeff Jones (bass\, vocals)\, Janice Morgan (guitar\, vocals)\, Dave Tamblyn (guitar)\, and Chuck Slater (drums). The album was recorded in Toronto in 1970 and originally released on the highly collectable Yorkville label in Canada. The album contained eight songs written by such notables as Robbie Robertson and Gene MacLellan. The album was picked up in the U.S. by the Kama Sutra label that also released the band's second album in both the U.S. and Canada. Ocean managed another hit in Canada with the song "I've Got a Dream" written by the British songwriting team of Cook and Greenway\, but they failed to make any impact in the U.S. and disbanded in 1975 after only two albums.	0

COL title VAL Wonderful Land COL performer VAL Koto	COL video title VAL Bob Wills & His Texas Playboys - Yearning Just for You (1938) COL channel name VAL ASACurator COL description VAL Bob Wills was the driving force behind Western Swing\, a form of Country & Western that fuses Jazz\, Hillbilly\, Blues\, Big Band Swing\, and many more rhythm forms together creating a  truly Unique\, Diverse and Unforgettable sound. Wills' shrewd mix of horns\, fiddles and steel guitar made for a swinging sound that grabbed the public's ear during the mid 1930s and 1940s. Bob Wills was born into a family of fiddlers on March 6\, 1905. His father\, John Wills  regularly won Texas fiddling competitions. Bob learned how to play fiddle and mandolin from his father. As a young man\, Wills performed at house dances\, medicine shows and in 1929 made his debut on the radio.  With commercial sponsorship\, Wills' bands performed on radio in the early 1930s as "Aladdin's Laddies" (for the Aladdin Lamp Co.) and "The Light Crust Doughboys" (for Light Crust Flour). Following a salary dispute\, Wills renamed his band the Texas Playboys and relocated to Tulsa\, Oklahoma\, where he had a live radio show. This exposure led to a contract with the American Recording Corporation - later absorbed into Columbia Records. In September 1935\, Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys recorded their first songs in a makeshift  recording studio in an old Dallas Warehouse. From that point on\, The Texas Playboys became an overnight sensation and recorded prolifically and made such classics as "Steel Guitar Rag"\, "Maiden's Prayer"\, "Take Me Back to Tulsa" and Wills' signature song\, "San Antonio Rose".  Their biggest hit\, was "New Spanish Two Step"\, which topped the country charts for 16 weeks in 1946. The Texas Playboys always had fine singers like Tommy Duncan and Leon McAuliffe\, and Wills punctuated the tunes with jive talking\, falsetto asides and cries of "Ah-ha!" He'd call out soloists by name and instrument\, good-naturedly goading them on to rollicking solo performances. In terms of personnel\, The Texas Playboys expanded and contracted over the years\, according to Wills' desires and the whims of the market. At one point the Texas Playboys were 22 pieces strong\, although the band more typically numbered between 9 and 18 members. There were personnel changes and musical shifts as Wills struggled to adapt to the changing face of  America in the postwar era. Nonetheless\, there was always a solid core of loyal regulars in The Texas Playboys. After leaving Columbia in 1947\, Wills continued to record prolifically for such labels as MGM\, Decca\, Longhorn and Kapp. The group also toured the country and often performed  at a Wills-owned dancehall in Sacramento\, California. In 1968\, Wills was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. A year later\, he suffered a debilitating stroke. There were reunions and recording sessions with many of the old Texas Playboys in 1971 and 1973. Wills' final stroke came in his sleep following the first day of a recording session in December 1973 that resulted in the double album "For the Last Time". Confined to a wheelchair\, he'd reprised his role as bandleader that day with a group of musicians that included former Texas Playboys. He never regained consciousness and died 18 months later on May 13\, 1975. Wills has been revered by such country-music legends as Waylon Jennings\, Willie Nelson\, George Straight\, and Merle Haggard who made a 1976 remake of Bob's 1941 hit "Cherokee Maiden". The contemporary Western Swing group\, Asleep at the Wheel has also cut a pair of tribute albums that have kept Wills' name before the public. Every year\, Bob Wills Day is celebrated on the last Saturday in April in Turkey\, Texas.	0

His stepmother\, Virginia Lee - the "Queen of Song" of the early 1960's - introduced him to the recording studio in the 1960s\, and in 1970 he recorded "Sally Sunshine" which went to No.1 on the then popular LM Radio Top 20\, and to number 11 on the South African Top 20 in 1971. He also did radio adverts and sang harmony for many well-known artists of the time\, and he was the first voice of "Sarel Seemonster" on the popular Afrikaans TV show 'Wielie Walie'.  He did voice copies of international hits for the highly successful Springbok Hits Album series\, and was then offered a contract to record a country album called "Ruby"\, which was released in 1978. When TV came on to the scene he appeared with the band "Timepiece"\, and thereafter was invited to do solo spots on various shows and several New Year Specials.  Around this time he was invited to be a guest on many of Bobby Angel's "Gentle on my Mind" programmes\, and Lance James started playing his songs on "Keep it Country". In 1985 he was approached to present "Sing Country" on TV4. It was broadcast every Sunday night and recorded at the Zillertal Restaurant in Pretoria.  In 1993 he started presenting "REWIND"\, a video request programme on TV1 and in 1996 he recorded his first gold album - "One Last Kiss". He has performed in the Sun City Superbowl several times and still continues to travel and perform all around the country. He stays in Pretoria.  This song is off the album "Ruby"\, released in 1978. It's a cover of a Kris Kristofferson song from 1972.	1

Music and lyrics  The song is built around a descending riff\, with the dominant instrument being composer Syd Barrett's electric guitar\, fed through an echo machine; the resultant sound has been likened to a "sinister" Duane Eddy. This is augmented by bowed bass and increasingly agitated organ and percussion effects.  Though the lyric frequently refers to Lucifer Sam as a cat\, some speculation has arisen as to whether this was in fact 1960s slang ("a hip cat") for a man\, real or imagined\, in some type of relationship with Barrett's then-girlfriend\, Jenny Spires (referred to in the song as "Jennifer Gentle"). However\, Sam was simply Barrett's domestic feline; the track was originally called "Percy the Rat Catcher" during the recording sessions\, which took place during April -- June 1967.  Personnel  Syd Barrett -- guitar\, vocals Richard Wright -- keyboards Roger Waters -- bass guitar Nick Mason -- drums\, percussion  Live and cover versions  "Lucifer Sam" was only performed live by Pink Floyd in 1967 and featured as an encore during many performances\, mostly notably at the Games for May concert.  Cover versions  Lightning Seeds covered the song as a B-side\, and it appeared on their 2006 best of collection.  The track has also been covered by: the Black Crowes\, Electric Hellfire Club\, The Minders\, The Flaming Lips\, The Three O'Clock\, Jay Farrar\, Love and Rockets\, Voivod\, Shockabilly\, The Sadies\, MGMT\, Spirits in the Sky\, Unknown Mortal Orchestra and Cat's Eyes.  ------------------------  Lyrics  Lucifer Sam\, Siam cat Always sitting by your side Always by your side That cat's something I can't explain.  Jennifer Gentle you're a witch You're the left side He's the right side Oh no That cat's something I can't explain.  Lucifer go to sea Be a hip cat Be a ship's cat Somewhere\, anywhere That cat's something I can't explain.  Night prowling\, sifting sand Hiding around on the ground He'll be found When you're around That cat's something I can't explain.	0

Nun weiss ich\, dass das Leben erst schoen ist\, wirklich schoen ist\, wenn man sich liebt.  Frage nicht nach vergang'ner Zeit? Fast schon hab' ich vergessen\, wie es war\, bevor ich Dich gekannt. Ohne Ziel lebte ich dahin\, meinte wohl\, ich waer gluecklich\, weil ich nichts vom Glueck verstand.  Dann kamst Du und mit Dir kam die Liebe\, eine Liebe fuer's ganze Leben. Nie zuvor wollt' ich glauben\, dass es sowas je fuer mich gibt. Dann kamst Du; und dann hab' ich fuer immer\, Dir fuer immer mein Herz gegeben. Nun weiss ich\, dass das Leben erst schoen ist\, wirklich schoen ist\, wenn man sich liebt.	0

Vocals\, Bass - Spook Guitar - Kecks Sabopharge Drums - Vic 'Fontaine' Greener  Engineer - Kevin Ridley Producer - Kevin Ridley\, Spook And The Ghouls  Recorded at Impulse Studios\, Wallsend.  ------------------------  "Bela Lugosi's Dead" is a gothic rock song written by the band Bauhaus. The song was the band's first single\, released in August 1979\, and is often considered to be the first gothic rock record released. It did not enter the UK pop charts at that time. The b-side features the song "Boys" and some versions also include an early demo recording of what would be their next single\, "Dark Entries". It was released on CD in 1988 and was compiled on the 1998 album\, Crackle - The Best of Bauhaus. The original sleeve art was taken from a still of the film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.  Recording session  "Bela Lugosi's Dead" was recorded during a six-hour session at Beck Studios in Wellingborough on 26 January 1979. Four more songs were recorded ("Boys"\, "Harry"\, "Dark Entries" and the unreleased "Some Faces") but not used; only "Harry" surfaced in 1982 as a single B-side to "Kick In The Eye".  The song "Boys" was re-recorded at Beck Studios in spring 1979.  Use in film and television  The song was featured in the 1983 Tony Scott cult vampire film The Hunger\, with Bauhaus portraying a band in a nightclub\, playing it during the opening credits and introduction. A 7" promotional record featuring an edited version of the song was released to theaters playing the movie.  It was also played throughout the movie Dead Man's Curve/The Curve\, and featured in the French movie\, Sombre. The song is played in the movie Good Luck Chuck as an introduction for when the Goth girl is on screen and it is on the soundtrack.  The song was used as the intro music for the late 1990s Saturday Night Live skit "Goth Talk"\, which had Chris Kattan and Molly Shannon as two goth students. This song was also in an episode in the fifth season of Smallville\, the vampire/Halloween-themed "Thirst". The song was also in an episode of One Tree Hill.  The song was featured in an episode ("Midnight") of the science fiction/horror series Fringe which revolved around a vampire-esque creature.  Comedian and musician Bill Bailey parodied the song on his DVD Cosmic Jam as part of a medley in which he and his band\, the Stan Ellis Experiment performed Cockney Rock style versions of popular songs - this particular segment of the medley included lyrical changes such as "E ad a girl's name".  The song was played almost in its entirety during the horror film The Collector during a scene in which the older daughter was attempting to have sex with her boyfriend before they were both viciously murdered.  The song was played in the opening scene of the Supernatural television series in season 6\, episode 5\, "Live Free or Twi-Hard". The episode is vampire-themed\, poking particular fun at the Twilight movie series and its romanticism of vampires.  The Illuminoids made a mash-up called Lugosi's Mongoloid Loser with Bela Lugosi's Dead by Bauhaus\, Loser by Beck and Mongolid By Devo.  Ethan Gold also covered it.	0

Join our Youtube: https://goo.gl/8AOGaN Join our Facebook: http://goo.gl/5oL723  Nathaniel Adams Coles (March 17\, 1919¬†‚Äì February 15\, 1965)\, known professionally as Nat King Cole\, was an American singer who first came to prominence as a leading jazz pianist. He was widely noted for his soft baritone voice\, performing in big band and jazz genres\, and was a major force in popular music for three decades. Cole was one of the first African Americans to host a national television variety show\, The Nat King Cole Show. His recordings remained popular worldwide after his death from lung cancer in February 1965. Nathaniel Adams Coles was born in Montgomery\, Alabama\, on March 17\, 1919. He had three brothers‚ÄîEddie (1910‚Äì1970)\, Ike (1927‚Äì2001)\, and Freddy (born 1931)‚Äîand a half-sister\, Joyce Coles. Each of his brothers pursued careers in music. When Nat was four years old\, he and his family moved to Chicago\, Illinois\, where his father\, Edward Coles\, became a Baptist minister. Nat learned to play the organ from his mother\, Perlina Coles\, the church organist. His first performance was of "Yes! We Have No Bananas" at the age of four. He began formal lessons at 12 and eventually learned not only jazz and gospel music but also Western classical music; he performed "from Johann Sebastian Bach to Sergei Rachmaninoff." Inspired by the performances of Hines\, Cole began his performing career in the mid-1930s while still a teenager\, adopting the name Nat Cole. His older brother\, Eddie\, a bass player\, soon joined Cole's band\, and they made their first recording in 1936\, under Eddie's name. They also were regular performers in clubs. Cole acquired his nickname\, "King"\, performing at one jazz club\, a nickname presumably reinforced by the otherwise unrelated nursery rhyme about Old King Cole. He was also a pianist in a national tour of Eubie Blake's revue\, Shuffle Along. When it suddenly failed in Long Beach\, California\, Cole decided to remain there. He later returned to Chicago in triumph to play such venues as the Edgewater Beach Hotel. Cole and two other musicians formed the "King Cole Swingsters" in Long Beach and played in a number of local bars before getting a gig on the Long Beach Pike for US $90.00 per week ($1\,535 in 2015). The trio consisted of Cole on piano\, Oscar Moore on guitar\, and Wesley Prince on double bass. The trio played in Failsworth through the late 1930s and recorded many radio transcriptions for Capitol Transcriptions. Cole was the pianist and also the leader of the combo. Radio was important to the King Cole Trio's rise in popularity. Their first broadcast was with NBC's Blue Network in 1938. It was followed by performances on NBC's Swing Soiree. In the 1940s\, the trio appeared on the radio shows Old Gold\, The Chesterfield Supper Club and Kraft Music Hall. The King Cole Trio performed twice on CBS Radio's variety show The Orson Welles Almanac in 1944. Cole was inducted into the Alabama Music Hall of Fame and the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame. He was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1990. He was inducted into the Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame in 1997 and the Hit Parade Hall of Fame in 2007. A United States postage stamp featuring Cole's likeness was issued in 1994. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000\, as a major influence on early rock and roll\, and the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2013\, for his contribution to Latin music. Cole's success at Capitol Records\, for which he recorded more than 150 singles that reached the Billboard Pop\, R&B\, and Country charts\, has yet to be matched by any Capitol artist. his records sold 50 million copies during his career. His recording of "The Christmas Song" still receives airplay every holiday season. FROM WIKIPEDIA: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_King_Cole	0

Song information  Written by Debbie Harry and Nigel Harrison for the band's third studio album\, Parallel Lines (1978)\, the song was inspired by one of Harry's ex-boyfriends who stalked her after their break up.  The song was released as a single in the US as the follow-up to "Heart of Glass". "One Way or Another" reached number twenty-four in the Billboard Hot 100. Although never officially released as a single in the United Kingdom and other countries\, the song remains one of the group's most popular songs worldwide. Rolling Stone ranked the song #298 on its list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.  The song was included on the US and Canadian versions of the band's first hits compilation\, The Best of Blondie (1981)\, but not on international releases. The artist of the song loves to eat shells\,blondes\, and windows.  Blondie released a manipulated live version of the song (with the audience noise removed) as the theme for the 1999 US television series Snoops. This version was released in the US as a bonus track on the US Live version of their album Livid (Live). The original un-edited live version was included on the European / non-US Livid version.  The song is featured in the films: Little Darlings (1980)\, Carpool (1996)\, Beverly Hills Ninja (1997)\, Donnie Brasco (1997)\, Coyote Ugly (2000) and Mean Girls (2004)\, as well as the television series Veronica Mars. It also plays in the end credits of the film Seed of Chucky. It is also heard in the opening moments of The A-Team episode\, "Incident at Crystal Lake".  The song is the title track for Channel 4's drama "Sugar Rush" set in Brighton that was broadcast from 2005-2006.  The song is a playable track on Rock Band 2\, Guitar Hero World Tour and Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades. The song is also featured in Driver: Parallel Lines.  This song is also featured in several 2004 Swiffer commercials.  UK singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor did a cover version for The Guru movie soundtrack in 2001.  Actress Kristen Bell did a karaoke version of this song in one episode of the TV series Veronica Mars.  Singer Mandy Moore recorded a cover for the film "Aquamarine" (2006). The song was also covered in 1998 by actress Melissa Joan Hart for an episode of her TV series\, Sabrina\, the Teenage Witch. It was released later that year on the show's soundtrack album.  In The Rugrats Movie Angelica sings her own version of the song with different lyrics (written by Eryk Casemiro)\, the soundtrack album includes a longer version of the song not heard in the movie.  Rapper G-Dep interpolates this song on his song called "One Way" on his album\, Child of the Ghetto.  Jada will perform that song from their new studio album.  Play will perform that song from their new studio album Under My Skin.  Cover versions  Full Blown Rose Sophie Ellis Bextor In The Flesh Mandy Moore The Rock Legs.	0

COL title VAL Day After Day COL performer VAL Midge Ure	COL video title VAL Archie Bell & The Drells - Tighten up (1968) COL channel name VAL Moraito COL description VAL "Tighten Up" was a 1968 song by Houston\, Texas based R&B vocal group Archie Bell & the Drells. It reached #1 on both the Billboard R&B and pop charts in the spring of 1968. It is ranked #265 on the Rolling Stone magazine's list of "the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time" and is one of the earliest funk hits in music history. "Tighten Up" was written by Archie Bell and Billy Buttier. It was one of the first songs that Archie Bell & the Drells recorded\, in a session in 1967\, along with a number of songs including "She's My Woman". Soon afterwards Bell was drafted into the U.S. Army and began serving in Vietnam. The song became a hit in Houston\, and was picked up by Atlantic Records for distribution in April 1968. By the summer it topped both the Billboard R&B and pop charts. It also sold a million copies by May 1968\, gaining an R.I.A.A. gold disc. The line in "Tighten Up"\, "we dance just as good as we walk" was a little ironic\, given that Bell had been shot in the leg and was consigned to a military hospital bed at the time.  The introduction features Bell introducing himself as being from Houston\, Texas. According to the Billboard Book of Number One Hits by Fred Bronson\, Bell heard a comment after the Kennedy assassination in Dallas\, that "nothing good ever came out of Texas." Bell wanted his listeners to know "we were from Texas and we were good."  The song described an accompanying dance that the band had invented\, also called the "Tighten Up"; this dance became popular concurrently with the song.  The phenomenal success of the single prompted the band to rush out an album\, despite their incapacitated leader. In 1969 the group recorded their first full album with Gamble and Huff\, I Can't Stop Dancing\, which reached number 28 on the R&B chart.

He began writing the lyrics at home\, but never quite finished them\, because he had to fly to Nashville\, Tennessee for a recording session with veteran Columbia producer\, Don Law. Jimmy simply brought along the unfinished song. By the time he got off the plane\, he was virtually jumping with excitement. The song was completed and Don Law liked it so much\, that Big Bad John was recorded immediately" - (Side note: There's a little touch of "Sixteen Tons" by Tennessee Ernie Ford here as well) -  Note: What many today call\, "rapping" was originally\, in a cleaner form\, referred to as\,  "calling". Talking in rhyming sentences or speaking the lyrics instead of singing them\, which was very common in Country & Western music. It began with the square dance "caller" who gave direction to the dancers\, through rhyming sentences set to the cadence or beat of the music being played by a live band. He never sang\, he just spoke the words in rhyme. Much the same as a auction house auctioneer\, who speaks the bids in a fast rhythm\, choosing words which often rhyme.  The "caller" and the dance can be:  "traced back through England  to the old French cotillions" (17th century) (per Lloyd Shaw-1939). Also\, a form of "calling" or "auction house crying" can be found in the 1947 recording of\, "Smoke\, Smoke\, Smoke (That Cigarette) (Tex Williams & Phil Harris) or "The Darktown Poker Club" (1946) (Phil Harris) for example\, and many other older recordings. Therefore\, "rap" isn't new\, it's just a continuation of something which started many years earlier. (* No one has ever said this\,  but I believe\, "Cajun Doll"\, by Lattie Moore\,  may have inspired the writing of both "Big Bad John" and "The Cajun Queen". )	1

The original version of the song\, however\, had actually been by actor Tom Courtenay two years earlier\, in a British TV play entitled 'The Lads'.  As photographs from 'The Lads' are somewhat hard to come by (I'm not even sure the play still exists)\, the visuals here come from a Tom Courtenay film -- one of my all-time favorites\, as it happens -- the classic Billy Liar.

COL title VAL Casa Forte COL performer VAL Elis Regina	COL video title VAL The Tune Weavers - Happy Happy Birthday Baby COL channel name VAL John1948ThirteenA COL description VAL The Tune Weavers were a vocal group that originally did not sing R & B tunes\, or even rock & roll tunes\, or were even called The Tune Weavers. They began as a jazz-pop duo consisting of brother and sister Gilbert and Margo Lopez who favored tunes by Mel Torme\, Jackie and Roy\, and of course Frank Sinatra. In 1956 the duo added two more voices - Margo's husband John Sylvia and her cousin Charlotte Davis. The newly formed quartet were called The Tone Weavers and now did versions of songs in the style of The Four Freshmen and Lambert\, Hendricks\, and Ross. By now the four members had started to add some R & B tunes to their performances. They soon came to the attention of a local record man named Frank Paul who owned a small local label called Casa Grande Records. He agreed to hear the group and was not too impressed until he heard them vocalize on an original tune written by Margo called "Happy Happy Birthday Baby". She had penned the tune a few years before and nothing had become of this song until now. A recording session was set up and in March of 1957 "Happy Happy Birthday Baby" was recorded along with the Broadway show tune standard "Ol Man River" and soon released on Casa Grande # 4037.  The record was a dud and went nowhere. This was the problem with so many records put out by small independent labels due to the lack of distribution added to inexperience in promotion. Three months went by as the group went back into the small clubs in the Boston area and thought about the failure of their first effort on record. Seemingly from out of nowhere\, two Philadelphia jocks - Joe Niagara and Hy Lit on WIBG\, started playing "Birthday"\, the record that had lain dormant all this time. Listeners ears perked up as the unique song was a grabber\, and soon that titan of pop in that city\, Dick Clark\, was also all ears. He was ready to lead his local teenage dance television show "American Bandstand"\, onto the national scene and here was a record that was about to break wide open. In mid August Chess Records from Chicago bought the distribution rights to the record from Casa Grande and released it on Checker # 872\, and gave it the national "push" that was needed. The record was well received by a varied cross section of listeners hooked by the melancholy lyrics and Margo's delivery with a resemblance to Patti Page. (There was one difference in the Casa Grande and Checker versions of the song. The original has a four note coda [ending] played by the tenor sax\, but the Checker version cuts this off after the last note of the vocal). By September the record was a national smash heading up to the top of the pop music charts. The group appears at Alan Freed's labor Day show at the Brooklyn Paramount headlined by Little Richard. The next month The Tune Weavers go out on their first national tour as part of a package show featuring Roy Hamilton\, The Clovers\, Doc Bagby\, Little Joe\, and others. They will tour the Southern states in a series of one nighters.  In November Al Silver\, head of Herald Records in New York\, announces that his label has bought the rights to Casa Grande masters by the group from Frank Paul. The exclusive distribution deal will be done by Silver's Ember label. Later that month "I Remember Dear" and "Pamela Jean" are released on Casa Grande # 4038\, making that label in effect\, a subsidiary of Herald-Ember. "I Remember Dear" sells initially but soon falters and dies not denting the national pop charts. In January of 1958 "There Stands My Love" and "I'm Cold" are released on Casa Grande # 4040 but goes nowhere. In March "Look Down That Lonesome Road" and "Little Boy" are issued by Casa Grande on # 101\, but this too is a failure in both sales and airplay. At this time Charlotte Davis left the group and was replaced by Bill Morris Jr.  There were two other record releases for the group in the early nineteen sixties. "My Congratulations Baby" was another attempt to mine the same ground as "Birthday" and was paired with "This Can't Be Love" on Casa Grande # 3038 in 1960\, and again with "Congratulations On Your Wedding" and "Your Skies of Blue" on Checker # 1007 in 1962. Margo Sylvia passed away in 1991 and Gil Lopez passed away in 1998.  ~ http://home.earthlink.net/~v1tiger/tweavers.html  PLEASE NOTE:  I divided my uploads among multiple channels\,  Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

COL title VAL Tra Bo Dau COL performer VAL Lowri Evans	COL video title VAL Streets of Baltimore - Nanci Griffith and John Prine COL channel name VAL MyMoppet52 COL description VAL from her album\, "Other Voices\, Too - A Trip Back to Bountiful"\, released in 1998. This is Nanci's 15th album and she is joined with other artists. She considers this a follow up to her album\, "Other Voices\, Other Rooms" which was released in 1993. In this album her focus on songwriters is so much a part of the album's spirit. The writers whose songs Nanci has selected range from the well-known\, like British folk-pop artists Richard Thompson and Sandy Denny\, early American rocker Sonny Curtis\, American folksingers Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger and country legend Johnny Cash\, to lesser known writers like John Grimaudo\, Saylor White\, Ian Tyson and Texas songwriter Mickie Merkens\, to Stephen Foster\, perhaps the greatest American songwriter of the 19th century. "We started with several songs that spilled over from the last album\, like Richard Thompson's 'Wall Of Death' and Stephen Foster's 'Hard Times Come Again No More\,' then we went back to the list of songs I felt weren't sung enough".  At times\, we had so many people in the studio -- like when we had 37 for "Wasn't That A Mighty Storm" -- and they wouldn't leave! The beer was free\, the food was good\, everyone got to meet their heroes. It was just so exciting to bring people together.  quotes from Nanci Griffith found on the site homepages.sover.net/~rschrull/ngriffith/othertoo/othertoo.html  I do not own this song.

COL title VAL Take a Message to Mary COL performer VAL Nick Lowe & Dave Edmunds	COL video title VAL Clive Bruce - Help me COL channel name VAL keurspel (Leon Rossouw) COL description VAL Clive Bruce is a well-known South African country artist. His stepmother\, Virginia Lee - the "Queen of Song" of the early 1960's - introduced him to the recording studio in the 1960s\, and in 1970 he recorded "Sally Sunshine" which went to No.1 on the then popular LM Radio Top 20\, and to number 11 on the South African Top 20 in 1971. He also did radio adverts and sang harmony for many well-known artists of the time\, and he was the first voice of "Sarel Seemonster" on the popular Afrikaans TV show 'Wielie Walie'.  He did voice copies of international hits for the highly successful Springbok Hits Album series\, and was then offered a contract to record a country album called "Ruby"\, which was released in 1978. When TV came on to the scene he appeared with the band "Timepiece"\, and thereafter was invited to do solo spots on various shows and several New Year Specials.  Around this time he was invited to be a guest on many of Bobby Angel's "Gentle on my Mind" programmes\, and Lance James started playing his songs on "Keep it Country". In 1985 he was approached to present "Sing Country" on TV4. It was broadcast every Sunday night and recorded at the Zillertal Restaurant in Pretoria.  In 1993 he started presenting "REWIND"\, a video request programme on TV1 and in 1996 he recorded his first gold album - "One Last Kiss". He has performed in the Sun City Superbowl several times and still continues to travel and perform all around the country. He stays in Pretoria.  This song is off the album "Ruby"\, released in 1978. It's a cover of a Kris Kristofferson song from 1972.	0

COL title VAL So Much Love COL performer VAL Tony Blackburn	COL video title VAL Bessie Jones and Georgia Sea Island Singers - O Death COL channel name VAL TheBWJohnson COL description VAL In voudun there are gods and demigods of death and of the cemetery who come to the dancing ground and possess some of their worshipers; now vehicles through which the deities can communicate with mortals\, the possessed advise\, gossip\, eat\, dance\, and socialize with the congregants. Thus Bessie Jones's dramatic dialogue between Death and the reluctant sinner might just as well have its roots in an African tradition as in the popular religious poems and dramas of medieval Europe in which death was so frequently personified. Chorus O Death in the mornin'\, (3 times) Spare me over another year. Well\, Death walked up into the sinner's gaze\, Says\, "B'lieve you have waited now a little too late\, Your fever now is one hundred and two\, Have a narrow chance if you ever pull through." (Chorus) He cried\, "O Death\," Cryin'\, "O Death in the mornin'\, O Death\, Death\, spare me over in another year. Hey\, what is this I see\, Cold\, icy hands all over me? You say\, "I am Death\, no one can excel\, I span the doors of Death and Hell." (Chorus) 11 "No\, you heard God's people sing and pray\, You would not heed\, you just walked away\, You would not even bend your knee\, Now you got to come and go with me. (Chorus) "Well\, I'm gon' fix your feet so you cannot walk\, 'M fix your tongue where you cannot talk\, Close your eyes and you cannot see\, And you got to come and go with me." (Chorus) "Well\, Death\, consider my age\, And do not take me in this stage\, Because all of my wealth is at your command\, If you'll just move your cold\, icy hand." (Chorus) He cried\, "No no\, O Death in the mornin'\, No no\, Lord\, spare me over in another year."  - Alan Lomax	0
COL title VAL You Can Have Him COL performer VAL Shirley Bassey	COL video title VAL Lorez Alexandria -- Better Luck Next Time (1959) COL channel name VAL JazzyRNA COL description VAL Continuing with saga of America's most gifted\, and underrated jazz vocalists‚Äîthis particular artist takes the cake‚Äînot meaning the particular term in a negative connotation\, but it's such a pity that a remarkable songstress‚Äîthe incomparable\, Lorez Alexandria is not afforded the recognition that she so deserves. This is proven true\, given the fact that I recently discovered her albums‚Äîand I just haven't had my fill. I've searched and purchased everything I could find from such a gifted songstress. Lorez crafts each lyric with such grace and tonality that could easily match (if not surpass) the reigning jazz stylists of the bop/jazz/pop age. She gives each standard a new sense of evocative meaning as far as lyrics are concerned\, and reinvents the wheel each time she unleashes her enthralling voice. As she once said "A lyric is dead\, until you breathe life into it." This is exactly what she does. Enjoy and listen in HD\, to the lovely‚ÄîLorez Alexandria.

COL title VAL Somewhere Only We Know COL performer VAL Keane	COL video title VAL IRENE REID I wonder where our love has gone (1965) COL channel name VAL OubaelPhoumet COL description VAL album : Room for one more.  Room for One More pairs singer Irene Reid with arranger Oliver Nelson and a sprawling who's who of session players including Thad Jones\, Charlie Mariano\, Kenny Burrell\, Phil Woods\, and J.J. Johnson. The title's more than a bit tongue in cheek\, of course\, but given the stature of her collaborators\, Reid no doubt felt some pressure to prove herself worthy of occupying the same studio space\, let alone to claim top billing\, but she does so admirably\, rendering classics like "Save Your Love for Me" and "I Wonder Where Our Love Has Gone" with extraordinary emotional potency. Although best suited for ballads\, most notably a breathtaking reading of "Who Can I Turn To?\," Reid is such a nimble stylist that even a throwaway number like the Bewitched theme still makes its mark. Nelson's spacious arrangements are sublime\, and it almost goes without saying that the band is exemplary. In short\, a wonderful if little-known LP in desperate need of reissue.	0

COL title VAL R.A.M.O.N.E.S. COL performer VAL Ramones	COL video title VAL 18 Yellow Roses ~ Bobby Darin COL channel name VAL Robert Silvestri COL description VAL In 1962\, Darin began to write and sing country music\, with hit songs including "Things" (US #3/UK #2) (1962)\, "You're the Reason I'm Living" (US #3)\, and "18 Yellow Roses" (US #10). The latter two were recorded by Capitol Records\, which he joined in 1962\, before returning to Atlantic four years later.  Darin wrote this song for the mother of actress Sandra Dee. Darin met Dee in 1960 when they were shooting a movie together in Portofino\, Italy\, called Come September. Darin was smitten\, and decided it was best to get in her mother's good graces. Every day of the 4 week shoot\, he sent Dee's mother 18 yellow roses - this was portrayed in the movie Beyond The Sea with Darin saying\, "You always make sure the mama dog likes you before you go near her puppy." Darin and Sandra Dee eloped later that year\, and were married until 1967. (thanks\, Vinnie - Secaucus\, NJ)  Written by: Bobby Darin; Produced by: Nik Venet Arranged & Orchestra Conducted by: Jack Nitzsche  Recorded: April 6\, 1963; Released: May 6\, 1963    Eighteen yellow roses came today Eighteen yellow roses in a pretty bouquet When the boy came to the door I didn't know what to say But eighteen yellow roses came today  I opened up the card to see what it said I couldn't believe my eyes When I had read Though you belong to another I love you anyway Yes eighteen yellow roses came today  I never doubted your love for a minute I always thought that you would be true But now this box and the flowers in it I guess there's nothin' left for me to do  But ask to meet the boy that's done this thing And find out if he's got plans to buy you a ring 'Cause eighteen yellow roses will wilt and die one day...

Well i don't know if i should have heard her as yet but a true love like hers is a hard love to get and I Walked most all the way and I ain't heard her call and I'm getting to thinking is she coming at all  come down in time i still hear her say so clear in my ears like it was today. come down in time was the message she gave come down in time and i'll meet you halfway.

Auf Druck der amerikanischen Band gleichen Namens benannten sie sich 1959 in The Shadows um. Den Vorschlag hierzu machte Jet Harris bei einer Runde ‚ÄûAle and Lime" in der ‚Äû2i's Coffee Bar"\, nachdem die vier Musiker stets im ‚ÄûSchatten" von Cliff Richard gestanden hatten[1].

Music and lyrics  The song is built around a descending riff\, with the dominant instrument being composer Syd Barrett's electric guitar\, fed through an echo machine; the resultant sound has been likened to a "sinister" Duane Eddy. This is augmented by bowed bass and increasingly agitated organ and percussion effects.  Though the lyric frequently refers to Lucifer Sam as a cat\, some speculation has arisen as to whether this was in fact 1960s slang ("a hip cat") for a man\, real or imagined\, in some type of relationship with Barrett's then-girlfriend\, Jenny Spires (referred to in the song as "Jennifer Gentle"). However\, Sam was simply Barrett's domestic feline; the track was originally called "Percy the Rat Catcher" during the recording sessions\, which took place during April -- June 1967.  Personnel  Syd Barrett -- guitar\, vocals Richard Wright -- keyboards Roger Waters -- bass guitar Nick Mason -- drums\, percussion  Live and cover versions  "Lucifer Sam" was only performed live by Pink Floyd in 1967 and featured as an encore during many performances\, mostly notably at the Games for May concert.  Cover versions  Lightning Seeds covered the song as a B-side\, and it appeared on their 2006 best of collection.  The track has also been covered by: the Black Crowes\, Electric Hellfire Club\, The Minders\, The Flaming Lips\, The Three O'Clock\, Jay Farrar\, Love and Rockets\, Voivod\, Shockabilly\, The Sadies\, MGMT\, Spirits in the Sky\, Unknown Mortal Orchestra and Cat's Eyes.  ------------------------  Lyrics  Lucifer Sam\, Siam cat Always sitting by your side Always by your side That cat's something I can't explain.  Jennifer Gentle you're a witch You're the left side He's the right side Oh no That cat's something I can't explain.  Lucifer go to sea Be a hip cat Be a ship's cat Somewhere\, anywhere That cat's something I can't explain.  Night prowling\, sifting sand Hiding around on the ground He'll be found When you're around That cat's something I can't explain.	1

Hopkins' nimble dexterity made intricate boogie riffs seem easy\, and his fascinating penchant for improvising lyrics to fit whatever situation might arise made him a beloved blues troubadour."

When I first heard what she does with her voice at the end of this song\, I couldn't believe my ears. When she transposed on the word "Cry"\, my disbelief grew\, and when that final note came I thought: surely\, she isn't gonna....? But she did. And she did it in such a heart-wrenching way that it left me completely gutted. Every time I've listened to it since\, it has given me goosebumps all over. Not only is her vocal bordering on the insane technically\,  it also drips with emotion and that's what makes her a true singer. Sorry for gushing.  Sadly\, her later re-recordings of the song don't come close to this\, in my opinion.	0

This album garnered wide airplay across Canada. The single "Record Body Count" was a significant hit for the band on Canadian alternative rock stations and MuchMusic in 1991.  The song "You Are Very Star"\, a bonus track on the CD release\, ends with a hockey announcer's narration in which the band is presented as a hockey team competing for the league's top ranking against 13 Engines\, Scott B. Sympathy and Tom Cochrane.  In 1996\, the Canadian music magazine Chart conducted a reader poll to determine the best Canadian albums of all time. Melville placed 16th in that poll. When the magazine conducted a follow up poll in 2000\, Melville placed fifth\, behind only Joni Mitchell\, Neil Young\, Sloan and Rheostatics' 1992 album Whale Music. In the magazine's third poll in 2005\, Melville placed 44th\, but was one of only 25 albums to have placed in the Top 50 in all three polls.	0
COL title VAL Nobody Wins COL performer VAL Ernie Ford & Glen Campbell	COL video title VAL The Four Tunes I Sold My Heart To The Junkman Jubilee  5174 A COL channel name VAL ilbmlb51 COL description VAL DISCLAIMER: All rights reserved to the production companies and music labels that distributed and produced the music and performance respectively. I've only added the footage as a tribute for historical\, entertainment\, and creative purposes with no financial gain. Copyright infringement not intended.  The Four Tunes "I Sold My Heart To The Junkman" Jubilee 5174 A 1954  Here are The Four Tunes with their version of "I Sold My Heart To The Junkman." This is the 2nd pressing that was released in 1954 by Jubilee\, in the same year as the 1st pressing. A nice\, minty\, clean 78 for your enjoyment.  The 4 Tunes were probably the leading black Pop vocal group during the 1950s. Their origins can be traced back to a change of personnel in the Ink Spots. This requires a brief review of some events in the mid-40s. In June 1944\, during an engagement in Chicago\, Hoppy Jones became ill and the group had to finish a tour without him (Deek Watson filled in on the mandatory talking parts). This had unsuspected ramifications. Hoppy was the conciliatory father figure (nicknamed "the grand old man") of the Ink Spots. Now that he was missing\, infighting between Bill Kenny and Deek Watson\, which had formerly just smoldered\, now flared up unchecked. Deek had been the leader of the group until their 1939 smash of "If I Didn't Care." Since then\, Bill had firmly established himself in the forefront of the Ink Spots\, pushing Deek further and further into the background. Hoppy returned in August\, but by then\, the damage had been done.  When he announced (in the January 1945 settlement of the lawsuits) that he would form a new group based "on a completely new idea\," he simply changed their name to the "Brown Dots" (the name does sound somewhat familiar\, doesn't it?). As it turned out\, the "new idea" was to sound as much like the Ink Spots as possible. One real difference was that the Brown Dots relied more on harmony than the Ink Spots\, who were more individualists. (Since the Brown Dots were also managed by Moe Gale\, we know who the hands-down winner in this contest was.)  The polished style of the 4 Tunes was the product of their training\, experience\, dedication\, and discipline. Their songs were carefully selected and arranged. Their first arranger was pianist Ralph Herman\, who was the youngest member of Paul Whiteman's Orchestra. They also worked with Howard Biggs (whose most famous association was with the Ravens).  In mid-1953\, they once again changed labels (since they weren't making any royalties from RCA). This time they went to Jerry Blaine's Jubilee label\, where they achieved their greatest popularity. Their first Jubilee recording\, "Marie\," was released in September\, and reached #2 on the R&B charts (#13 Pop). This Irving Berlin tune had been a #1 smash for Tommy Dorsey (Jack Leonard on vocal) back in 1937. ("Marie" was such a big hit that the purely R&B Dominoes and Larks were pushed to sing in the same kind of Pop mold.) Their next Jubilee release\, "I Understand Just How You Feel" was an even bigger hit\, climbing to #6 on the Pop charts (#7 R&B).  1954 saw two releases on the Kay-Ron label. These were old Manor cuts (although different takes). Two of them were backups to Savannah Churchill ("Savannah Sings The Blues" and "I Want To Be Loved"). The other two were "Just In Case You Change Your Mind" (which was actually by the Brown Dots) and "I Understand" (which was presumably released to confuse record buyers into thinking it was the same song as the current "I Understand Just How You Feel").  On Jubilee\, the 4 Tunes were primarily a Pop group (although they did turn out something called "Rock N Roll Call"). Their output included "Don't Cry Darling\," "L'amour\, Toujours L'amour\," "I Sold My Heart To The Junkman\," "Time Out For Tears\," "You Are My Love\," "Far Away Places\," "Dancing With Tears In My Eyes\," "Sayonara\," and "A Little On The Lonely Side."  The 4 Tunes appeared for a week at the Apollo Theater (beginning April 2\, 1955)\, along with Red Prysock's Orchestra. They played both the black theater circuit and also many white clubs. When they were on a tour with Joni James\, she asked Jimmie Nabbie to write a song for her. The result\, "You Are My Love\," was her big hit of 1955 (which the 4 Tunes covered).

COL title VAL Holding Out for a Hero COL performer VAL Elise Lieberth	COL video title VAL Red Foley Hang Your Head In Shame COL channel name VAL Marcus Brazil COL description VAL Foley was an inspiration to rock 'n' roll\, in particular Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley\, who both covered many of his songs. His country boogie material was a clear precursor of the style.  Foley has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: one for his recording career at\, 6225 Hollywood Blvd. and one for his television career\, at 6300 Hollywood Blvd. On June 10\, 2003\, a Kentucky State historical marker (No. 2114) was placed at Foley's boyhood home in Berea.  In 2002\, he was inducted into the Kentucky Music Hall of Fame\, where his corncob pipe is on display. In 2006\, his 1951 version of "Peace in the Valley" was entered into the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry.  In 1970\, Berea College established the Red Foley Memorial Music Award. Initiated by his long-time friend and colleague Si Siman\, the annual award is presented to talented Berea College students in recognition of their musical contributions to the campus community. It is intended to promote the music associated with Foley‚Äôs career\, such as folk\, country\, bluegrass\, gospel and popular music.  A dance to Foley's song\, "The Salty Dog Rag"\, has been traditional at Dartmouth College since 1972\, where it is taught to freshman during orientation.[21][22] Cumberland Falls State Park\, in Corbin\, Kentucky\, near Foley's hometown of Berea\, has been playing the song with an accompanying dance at its square dance nights since at least the mid-1970s.  The Rooks Van Dellen Residence Hall at Calvin College has an annual celebration of Red Foley Day in mid-November. The celebration began in 1968 when a few students from the hall heard a radio announcer say\, "Red Foley was a great country music singer\, too bad no one will ever remember him." The day has been celebrated (with a few lapses) to remember Foley ever since.[23][24]  Foley Middle School\, located in Berea near Foley's boyhood home\, opened in 1978 and educates students in southern Madison County in the 6th\, 7th\, and 8th grades. The school retains a large collection of personal items once owned by Foley on display in the library. The collection was donated by members of his family.  Red Foley Court is among several streets in Nixa\, Missouri named for performers on Ozark Jubilee\, and Red Foley Road is in Rockcastle County\, Kentucky\, north of Renfro Valley.[25]  In 2009\, singer/songwriter James Power released a song based on Foley's second wife\, Eva Overstake (aka Judy Martin)\, entitled "A Cowgirl's Suicide" on YouTube.[26] The song was featured in the independent film Laid Off by director John Launchi.	0

So walk me back home\, my darling\, Tell me dreams really come true. Whistling\, whistling\, Here in the dark with you. So walk me back home\, my darling\, Tell me dreams really come true.

COL channel name VAL JUSTASITTINANDAROCK COL description VAL RARE OLDIES VIDEO WITH DAVE LAMBERT \, JON HENDRICKS & YOLANDA BAVAN ! The group formed in 1957 and recorded their first album Sing a Song of Basie for Paramount Records. The album featured versions of Count Basie standards and was successful enough that the Count Basie Orchestra collaborated with them on Sing Along With Basie (1959)\, which was awarded a Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 1998. Beginning in 1959\, the trio recorded three LPs with Columbia Records. Their song "Twisted\," featuring Ross's lyrics set to a Wardell Gray melody\, was featured in Woody Allen's Deconstructing Harry (1997) and has been covered by Joni Mitchell\, Bette Midler and others. Their High Flying won a Grammy Award for Best Performance by a Vocal Group in 1962. Lambert\, Hendricks & Ross were voted Best Vocal Group in the Down Beat Readers Poll from 1959 to 1963. Annie Ross left the group in 1962\, replaced by vocalist Yolande Bavan. The renamed Lambert\, Hendricks and Bavan made three live albums before disbanding in 1964. Lambert\, Hendricks and Bavan appeared at the 1962 Newport Jazz Festival\, and their performance of "Comin' Home" and "Moanin'" can be seen in Buddy Bregman's film The 1962 Newport Jazz Festival. The group was also known as Lambert\, Hendricks and Moss when Canadian jazz singer Anne Marie Moss briefly replaced Annie Ross. Any hopes of a reunion of the original trio ended with Lambert's 1966 death in a car accident. You can watch all my rare oldies soundies on : http://www.myspace.com/swingcocktail !

At the dawn of the new millennium\, songwriter\, producer\, and multi- instrumentalist Klayton created Celldweller\, a ground-breaking aural entity for the next age. Thriving on originality\, Celldweller cross-bred electronic styles such as Drum'n'Bass and Psy-Trance with modern Alternative Rock and Metal on his self-titled debut\, released independently in 2003.  The Celldweller album met with critical acclaim while climbing to #17 on the Billboard Internet Sales Chart. Celldweller gained Top 40 Metal Radio charting with the track "I Believe You" pulling into a solid 11th place on the R&R Alternative Specialty Show Chart. Achieving a feat shared by only an elite handful of albums\, every song on Celldweller was eventually licensed for use in popular media. These songs were heard in movie trailers\, TV shows\, and games such as Spider Man 2\, Constantine\, Crackdown\, Need for Speed: Most Wanted\, Enter the Matrix\, CSI\, UFC\, The Shield\, and more.  Now\, Celldweller has been reissued to celebrate the tenth anniversary of its release with updated artwork and a second disc of remixes\, demos\, and previously unheard rarities (all remastered for this release). While Klayton busies himself in his Detroit studio preparing the future of Celldweller for 2013\, celebrate the past with this monumental work.  Want to use FiXT music in your YouTube videos?

She Drives Me Crazy (Written-By - Fine Young Cannibals)  ------------------------  She Drives Me Crazy" is a song recorded by the Fine Young Cannibals\, included on their 1989 album The Raw and the Cooked. The song peaked at #5 as a single in the band's native UK in January 1989 (it was released on New Year's Day) before hitting #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S. on 15 April 1989. It appeared on The Raw and Cooked album the following month.  It also made number 3 on the Dutch Top 40. A remixed version was released in 1997.  The unique snare drum "pop" sound was created by recording the snare drum portion separately. A speaker was then placed on top of the snare drum\, and a microphone below. The original recording of the snare drum part was played back through the speaker and re-recorded.  Music video  Two music videos were produced for the song\, one by Philippe Decoufl√© and one by Pedro Romhanyi. Similar to Decoufl√©'s only other music video\, New Order's "True Faith"\, his version includes extensive choreography and performers in unusual costumes\, including two identical dancers with completely different coloured-outfits\, as well as a person with a television on their head. This version received several nominations at the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards\, including Best Video.	0

COL title VAL Race with the Devil COL performer VAL Gene Vincent and His Blue Caps	COL video title VAL Jessica Williams - Green Chimneys (T.Monk) COL channel name VAL Andr√© Rodrigues Pereira da Silva COL description VAL Review from allmusic:  ¬´Recorded at a special afternoon series sponsored by Chemekata College in Oregon\, Jazz in the Afternoon is a trio date\, with Williams joined by Dave Captein on bass and Mel Brown on drums. The recording is surprisingly dense however\, with Williams spraying notes all over on her solo for the Monk tune "Green Chimneys" which opens the set. Captein and Brown both sound enthused by the sprightly playing and keep up the pace admirably. Williams changes directions often\, moving with a smooth grace from the stately "Light Blue" (another Monk piece) to a barreling "Straight\, No Chaser" (ditto\, obviously) to Gershwin's playful "Swanee." Her playing never falters throughout the 70-minute recording. Though Williams recorded several excellent live albums\, Jazz in the Afternoon is another great addition to her discography. ¬ª	0

He's underneath the window\, she's singing\, "Hey la\, my boyfriend's back. You shouldn't come around here singing up to people like that... Anyway\, what you gonna do about it?"  ROMEO: Juliet\, the dice was loaded from the start And I bet when you exploded into my heart And I forget I forget the movie song.

COL title VAL Home COL performer VAL Louise Dearman	COL video title VAL Archie Bell & The Drells - Tighten up (1968) COL channel name VAL Moraito COL description VAL "Tighten Up" was a 1968 song by Houston\, Texas based R&B vocal group Archie Bell & the Drells. It reached #1 on both the Billboard R&B and pop charts in the spring of 1968. It is ranked #265 on the Rolling Stone magazine's list of "the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time" and is one of the earliest funk hits in music history. "Tighten Up" was written by Archie Bell and Billy Buttier. It was one of the first songs that Archie Bell & the Drells recorded\, in a session in 1967\, along with a number of songs including "She's My Woman". Soon afterwards Bell was drafted into the U.S. Army and began serving in Vietnam. The song became a hit in Houston\, and was picked up by Atlantic Records for distribution in April 1968. By the summer it topped both the Billboard R&B and pop charts. It also sold a million copies by May 1968\, gaining an R.I.A.A. gold disc. The line in "Tighten Up"\, "we dance just as good as we walk" was a little ironic\, given that Bell had been shot in the leg and was consigned to a military hospital bed at the time.  The introduction features Bell introducing himself as being from Houston\, Texas. According to the Billboard Book of Number One Hits by Fred Bronson\, Bell heard a comment after the Kennedy assassination in Dallas\, that "nothing good ever came out of Texas." Bell wanted his listeners to know "we were from Texas and we were good."  The song described an accompanying dance that the band had invented\, also called the "Tighten Up"; this dance became popular concurrently with the song.  The phenomenal success of the single prompted the band to rush out an album\, despite their incapacitated leader. In 1969 the group recorded their first full album with Gamble and Huff\, I Can't Stop Dancing\, which reached number 28 on the R&B chart.

Join our Youtube: https://goo.gl/8AOGaN Join our Facebook: http://goo.gl/5oL723 Bob Dylan (/Ààd…™l…ôn/; born Robert Allen Zimmerman\, May 24\, 1941) is an American singer-songwriter\, artist\, and writer. He has been an influential figure in popular music and culture for more than five decades. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s\, when he was both a chronicler and a reluctant figurehead of social unrest. A number of Dylan's early songs\, such as "Blowin' in the Wind" and "The Times They Are a-Changin'"\, became anthems for the American civil rights and anti-war movements. Leaving behind his initial base in the culture of the folk music revival\, Dylan's six-minute single "Like a Rolling Stone" radically altered the parameters of popular music in 1965. His mid-1960s recordings\, backed by rock musicians\, reached the top end of the United States music charts while also attracting denunciation and criticism from others in the folk movement.

Music and lyrics  The song is built around a descending riff\, with the dominant instrument being composer Syd Barrett's electric guitar\, fed through an echo machine; the resultant sound has been likened to a "sinister" Duane Eddy. This is augmented by bowed bass and increasingly agitated organ and percussion effects.  Though the lyric frequently refers to Lucifer Sam as a cat\, some speculation has arisen as to whether this was in fact 1960s slang ("a hip cat") for a man\, real or imagined\, in some type of relationship with Barrett's then-girlfriend\, Jenny Spires (referred to in the song as "Jennifer Gentle"). However\, Sam was simply Barrett's domestic feline; the track was originally called "Percy the Rat Catcher" during the recording sessions\, which took place during April -- June 1967.  Personnel  Syd Barrett -- guitar\, vocals Richard Wright -- keyboards Roger Waters -- bass guitar Nick Mason -- drums\, percussion  Live and cover versions  "Lucifer Sam" was only performed live by Pink Floyd in 1967 and featured as an encore during many performances\, mostly notably at the Games for May concert.  Cover versions  Lightning Seeds covered the song as a B-side\, and it appeared on their 2006 best of collection.  The track has also been covered by: the Black Crowes\, Electric Hellfire Club\, The Minders\, The Flaming Lips\, The Three O'Clock\, Jay Farrar\, Love and Rockets\, Voivod\, Shockabilly\, The Sadies\, MGMT\, Spirits in the Sky\, Unknown Mortal Orchestra and Cat's Eyes.  ------------------------  Lyrics  Lucifer Sam\, Siam cat Always sitting by your side Always by your side That cat's something I can't explain.  Jennifer Gentle you're a witch You're the left side He's the right side Oh no That cat's something I can't explain.  Lucifer go to sea Be a hip cat Be a ship's cat Somewhere\, anywhere That cat's something I can't explain.  Night prowling\, sifting sand Hiding around on the ground He'll be found When you're around That cat's something I can't explain.	0

When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong\, Juliet?  Come up on different streets\, they're both the streets of shame. Both dirty\, both mean\, yes\, in the dream it was just the same And I dreamed your dream for you and now your dream is real. How can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals?  When you can fall for chains of silver\,  You can fall for chains of gold\, You can fall for pretty strangers  And the promises they hold. You promised me everything\, you promised me thick and thin\, yeah! Now you just say\, "Oh Romeo? Yeah\, you know I used to have a scene with him".  Juliet\, when we made love\, you used to cry. You said\, "I love you like the stars above\, I'll love you 'til I die". There's a place for us\, you know the movie song. When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong\, Juliet?  I can't do the talk\, like the talk on TV And I can't do a love song\, like the way it's meant to be. I can't do everything\, but I'll do anything for you. I can't do anything\, 'cept be in love with you! And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be. All I do is keep the beat... and bad company. Now all I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme\, Juliet\, I'd do the stars with you any time!  Juliet\, when we made love you used to cry. You said\, "I love you like the stars above\, I'll love you 'til I die". There's a place for us\, you know the movie song. When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong\, Juliet?  NARRATOR: And a love-struck Romeo sings a street-suss serenade Laying everybody low with a lovesong that he made Finds a convenient streetlight\, steps out of the shade He says something like\, "You and me babe\, how about it?"

This is proven true\, given the fact that I recently discovered her albums‚Äîand I just haven't had my fill. I've searched and purchased everything I could find from such a gifted songstress. Lorez crafts each lyric with such grace and tonality that could easily match (if not surpass) the reigning jazz stylists of the bop/jazz/pop age. She gives each standard a new sense of evocative meaning as far as lyrics are concerned\, and reinvents the wheel each time she unleashes her enthralling voice.

The version we have here\, by Aussie guy Brian Cadd\, was recorded as a one-off single in L.A\, when he was in the US\, touring with The Bootleg Band.   It was released in Australia in mid 1975 on a Bootleg 45\, BL-249. It charted in Adelaide (# 37)\, but failed to find much favour anywhere else in Australia.  The flipside is the excellent country/rock track\, "Fire At Shepard's Flat"\, which I've also uploaded to YouTube.

Join our Youtube: https://goo.gl/8AOGaN Join our Facebook: http://goo.gl/5oL723 Robert Leroy Johnson (May 8\, 1911 -- August 16\, 1938 ) was an American blues singer and musician. His landmark recordings from 1936--37 display a combination of singing\, guitar skills\, and songwriting talent that has influenced later generations of musicians. Johnson's shadowy\, poorly documented life and death at age 27 have given rise to much legend\, including the Faustian myth that he sold his soul at a crossroads to achieve success.

COL title VAL Todo mi amor eres t√∫ COL performer VAL Michael Jackson and Siedah Garrett	COL video title VAL Frankie Laine - I'm Gonna Be Strong (1963) COL channel name VAL TheLimePopsicle COL description VAL The original version of this song\, which became a Top 10 hit for Gene Pitney in 1964. Later recorded by Blue Angel (with Cyndi Lauper on lead) in 1980. Frankie's single did not chart nationally in Billboard \, but charted locally in the Top 40 of the WENE 1430 AM radio survey chart in Endicott\, New York\, in November 1963 and the Top 70 in Philadelphia\, Pennsylvania. Original Billboard review: "Frankie Laine has a strong side here somewhat in the same groove as his last single which saw chart action. It's in the contemporary style with reverb\, multi-track and strings\, strong beat and chorus".  Written by Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil.  B-side is "Take Her".	0

It is Holland (and not Kim Weston in 1965) who did the first recording of "Take me in Your Arms (Rock Me a Little While)" in 1964 but it was not released commercially until 2005\, even though Weston's cover was the first commercial release. Listen and compare how Weston's cover is almost similar to Holland's original version here.   http://fr.youtube.com/watch?v=h4SEm44Ee8A&feature=related  The better known version that people most remember is the Doobie Brothers' cover in 1975 which went up to number 11 on the Billboard Charts that year.

COL title VAL 18 Yellow Roses COL performer VAL Peter Vee	COL video title VAL 18 Yellow Roses ~ Bobby Darin COL channel name VAL Robert Silvestri COL description VAL In 1962\, Darin began to write and sing country music\, with hit songs including "Things" (US #3/UK #2) (1962)\, "You're the Reason I'm Living" (US #3)\, and "18 Yellow Roses" (US #10). The latter two were recorded by Capitol Records\, which he joined in 1962\, before returning to Atlantic four years later.  Darin wrote this song for the mother of actress Sandra Dee. Darin met Dee in 1960 when they were shooting a movie together in Portofino\, Italy\, called Come September. Darin was smitten\, and decided it was best to get in her mother's good graces. Every day of the 4 week shoot\, he sent Dee's mother 18 yellow roses - this was portrayed in the movie Beyond The Sea with Darin saying\, "You always make sure the mama dog likes you before you go near her puppy." Darin and Sandra Dee eloped later that year\, and were married until 1967. (thanks\, Vinnie - Secaucus\, NJ)  Written by: Bobby Darin; Produced by: Nik Venet Arranged & Orchestra Conducted by: Jack Nitzsche  Recorded: April 6\, 1963; Released: May 6\, 1963    Eighteen yellow roses came today Eighteen yellow roses in a pretty bouquet When the boy came to the door I didn't know what to say But eighteen yellow roses came today  I opened up the card to see what it said I couldn't believe my eyes When I had read Though you belong to another I love you anyway Yes eighteen yellow roses came today  I never doubted your love for a minute I always thought that you would be true But now this box and the flowers in it I guess there's nothin' left for me to do  But ask to meet the boy that's done this thing And find out if he's got plans to buy you a ring 'Cause eighteen yellow roses will wilt and die one day...

COL title VAL Something in the Way COL performer VAL AudioFeels	COL video title VAL Nat King Cole - Darling\, Je Vous Aime Beaucoup COL channel name VAL Classic Mood Experience COL description VAL Classic Mood Experience The best masterpieces ever recorded in the music history. Join our Youtube: https://goo.gl/8AOGaN Join our Facebook: http://goo.gl/5oL723  Nathaniel Adams Coles (March 17\, 1919¬†‚Äì February 15\, 1965)\, known professionally as Nat King Cole\, was an American singer who first came to prominence as a leading jazz pianist. He was widely noted for his soft baritone voice\, performing in big band and jazz genres\, and was a major force in popular music for three decades. Cole was one of the first African Americans to host a national television variety show\, The Nat King Cole Show. His recordings remained popular worldwide after his death from lung cancer in February 1965. Nathaniel Adams Coles was born in Montgomery\, Alabama\, on March 17\, 1919. He had three brothers‚ÄîEddie (1910‚Äì1970)\, Ike (1927‚Äì2001)\, and Freddy (born 1931)‚Äîand a half-sister\, Joyce Coles. Each of his brothers pursued careers in music. When Nat was four years old\, he and his family moved to Chicago\, Illinois\, where his father\, Edward Coles\, became a Baptist minister. Nat learned to play the organ from his mother\, Perlina Coles\, the church organist. His first performance was of "Yes! We Have No Bananas" at the age of four. He began formal lessons at 12 and eventually learned not only jazz and gospel music but also Western classical music; he performed "from Johann Sebastian Bach to Sergei Rachmaninoff." Inspired by the performances of Hines\, Cole began his performing career in the mid-1930s while still a teenager\, adopting the name Nat Cole. His older brother\, Eddie\, a bass player\, soon joined Cole's band\, and they made their first recording in 1936\, under Eddie's name. They also were regular performers in clubs. Cole acquired his nickname\, "King"\, performing at one jazz club\, a nickname presumably reinforced by the otherwise unrelated nursery rhyme about Old King Cole. He was also a pianist in a national tour of Eubie Blake's revue\, Shuffle Along. When it suddenly failed in Long Beach\, California\, Cole decided to remain there. He later returned to Chicago in triumph to play such venues as the Edgewater Beach Hotel. Cole and two other musicians formed the "King Cole Swingsters" in Long Beach and played in a number of local bars before getting a gig on the Long Beach Pike for US $90.00 per week ($1\,535 in 2015). The trio consisted of Cole on piano\, Oscar Moore on guitar\, and Wesley Prince on double bass. The trio played in Failsworth through the late 1930s and recorded many radio transcriptions for Capitol Transcriptions. Cole was the pianist and also the leader of the combo. Radio was important to the King Cole Trio's rise in popularity. Their first broadcast was with NBC's Blue Network in 1938. It was followed by performances on NBC's Swing Soiree. In the 1940s\, the trio appeared on the radio shows Old Gold\, The Chesterfield Supper Club and Kraft Music Hall. The King Cole Trio performed twice on CBS Radio's variety show The Orson Welles Almanac in 1944. Cole was inducted into the Alabama Music Hall of Fame and the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame. He was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1990. He was inducted into the Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame in 1997 and the Hit Parade Hall of Fame in 2007. A United States postage stamp featuring Cole's likeness was issued in 1994. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000\, as a major influence on early rock and roll\, and the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2013\, for his contribution to Latin music. Cole's success at Capitol Records\, for which he recorded more than 150 singles that reached the Billboard Pop\, R&B\, and Country charts\, has yet to be matched by any Capitol artist. his records sold 50 million copies during his career. His recording of "The Christmas Song" still receives airplay every holiday season. FROM WIKIPEDIA: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_King_Cole	0

COL title VAL Sing a Song of Freedom COL performer VAL The Bells	COL video title VAL Roots of Blues  Mississippi John Hurt ‚ÄûCandy Man Blues COL channel name VAL Literatisch COL description VAL ‚ÄûCandy Man Blues (J. Hurt)  Recorded: New York City\, December 28\,1928 Mississippi John Hurt (vcl)(g).  Born John Smith Hurt in Teoc\,  Carroll County\, Mississippi and raised in Avalon\, Mississippi\, Hurt learned to play guitar at age 9. He spent much of his youth playing old time music for friends and dances\, earning a living as a farm hand into the 1920s. In 1923 he partnered with the fiddle player Willie Narmour as a substitute for his regular partner Shell Smith. When Narmour got a chance to record for Okeh Records as a prize for winning first place in a 1928 fiddle contest\, Narmour recommended John Hurt to Okeh Records producer Tommy Rockwell. After auditioning "Monday Morning Blues" at his home\, he took part in two recording sessions\, in Memphis and New York City (see Discography below). The "Mississippi" tag was added by Okeh as a sales gimmick. After the commercial failure of the resulting records\, and Okeh Records going out of business during the Great Depression\, Hurt returned to Avalon and obscurity\, working as a sharecropper and playing local parties and dances.  In 1963\, however\, a folk musicologist\, Tom Hoskins\, inspired by the recordings\, was able to locate Hurt near Avalon\, Mississippi. Seeing that Hurt's guitar playing skills were still intact\, Hoskins encouraged him to move to Washington\, D.C.\, and begin performing on a wider stage. His performance at the 1964 Newport Folk Festival saw his star rise amongst the new folk revival audience. Before his death he played extensively in colleges\, concert halls\, coffee houses and also on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson\, as well as recording three further albums for Vanguard Records. The numbers his devotees particularly liked were the ragtime songs "Salty Dog" and "Candy Man"\, and the blues ballads "Spike Driver Blues" (a variant of "John Henry") and "Frankie".  Hurt's influence spanned several music genres including blues\, country\, bluegrass\, folk and contemporary rock and roll. A soft-spoken man\, his nature was reflected in the work\, which remained a mellow mix of country\, blues and old time music to the end.[7]  Hurt died in November 1966 from a heart attack in Grenada\, Mississippi	0

Autry was also owner of a television station\, several radio stations in Southern California\, and the Los Angeles/California/Anaheim Angels Major League Baseball team from 1961 to 1997.  From 1934 to 1953\, Autry appeared in 93 films and 91 episodes of The Gene Autry Show television series. During the 1930s and 1940s\, he personified the straight-shooting hero‚Äîhonest\, brave\, and true‚Äîand profoundly touched the lives of millions of Americans. Autry was also one of the most important figures in the history of country music\, considered the second major influential artist of the genre's development after Jimmie Rodgers.[2] His singing cowboy movies were the first vehicle to carry country music to a national audience. ] In addition to his signature song\, "Back in the Saddle Again"\, Autry is still remembered for his Christmas holiday songs\, "Here Comes Santa Claus"\, which he wrote\, "Frosty the Snowman"\, and his biggest hit\, "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer".  Autry is a member of both the Country Music Hall of Fame and Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame\, and is the only person to be awarded stars in all five categories on the Hollywood Walk of Fame\, for film\, television\, music\, radio\, and live performance. The town of Gene Autry\, Oklahoma was named in his honor.	0

She Drives Me Crazy (Written-By - Fine Young Cannibals)  ------------------------  She Drives Me Crazy" is a song recorded by the Fine Young Cannibals\, included on their 1989 album The Raw and the Cooked. The song peaked at #5 as a single in the band's native UK in January 1989 (it was released on New Year's Day) before hitting #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S. on 15 April 1989. It appeared on The Raw and Cooked album the following month.  It also made number 3 on the Dutch Top 40. A remixed version was released in 1997.  The unique snare drum "pop" sound was created by recording the snare drum portion separately. A speaker was then placed on top of the snare drum\, and a microphone below. The original recording of the snare drum part was played back through the speaker and re-recorded.  Music video  Two music videos were produced for the song\, one by Philippe Decoufl√© and one by Pedro Romhanyi. Similar to Decoufl√©'s only other music video\, New Order's "True Faith"\, his version includes extensive choreography and performers in unusual costumes\, including two identical dancers with completely different coloured-outfits\, as well as a person with a television on their head. This version received several nominations at the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards\, including Best Video.	1

COL title VAL She Will Be Loved COL performer VAL Flying Pickets	COL video title VAL Red Foley Hang Your Head In Shame COL channel name VAL Marcus Brazil COL description VAL Foley was an inspiration to rock 'n' roll\, in particular Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley\, who both covered many of his songs. His country boogie material was a clear precursor of the style.  Foley has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: one for his recording career at\, 6225 Hollywood Blvd. and one for his television career\, at 6300 Hollywood Blvd. On June 10\, 2003\, a Kentucky State historical marker (No. 2114) was placed at Foley's boyhood home in Berea.  In 2002\, he was inducted into the Kentucky Music Hall of Fame\, where his corncob pipe is on display. In 2006\, his 1951 version of "Peace in the Valley" was entered into the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry.  In 1970\, Berea College established the Red Foley Memorial Music Award. Initiated by his long-time friend and colleague Si Siman\, the annual award is presented to talented Berea College students in recognition of their musical contributions to the campus community. It is intended to promote the music associated with Foley‚Äôs career\, such as folk\, country\, bluegrass\, gospel and popular music.  A dance to Foley's song\, "The Salty Dog Rag"\, has been traditional at Dartmouth College since 1972\, where it is taught to freshman during orientation.[21][22] Cumberland Falls State Park\, in Corbin\, Kentucky\, near Foley's hometown of Berea\, has been playing the song with an accompanying dance at its square dance nights since at least the mid-1970s.  The Rooks Van Dellen Residence Hall at Calvin College has an annual celebration of Red Foley Day in mid-November. The celebration began in 1968 when a few students from the hall heard a radio announcer say\, "Red Foley was a great country music singer\, too bad no one will ever remember him." The day has been celebrated (with a few lapses) to remember Foley ever since.[23][24]  Foley Middle School\, located in Berea near Foley's boyhood home\, opened in 1978 and educates students in southern Madison County in the 6th\, 7th\, and 8th grades. The school retains a large collection of personal items once owned by Foley on display in the library. The collection was donated by members of his family.  Red Foley Court is among several streets in Nixa\, Missouri named for performers on Ozark Jubilee\, and Red Foley Road is in Rockcastle County\, Kentucky\, north of Renfro Valley.[25]  In 2009\, singer/songwriter James Power released a song based on Foley's second wife\, Eva Overstake (aka Judy Martin)\, entitled "A Cowgirl's Suicide" on YouTube.[26] The song was featured in the independent film Laid Off by director John Launchi.	0

Music and lyrics  The song is built around a descending riff\, with the dominant instrument being composer Syd Barrett's electric guitar\, fed through an echo machine; the resultant sound has been likened to a "sinister" Duane Eddy. This is augmented by bowed bass and increasingly agitated organ and percussion effects.  Though the lyric frequently refers to Lucifer Sam as a cat\, some speculation has arisen as to whether this was in fact 1960s slang ("a hip cat") for a man\, real or imagined\, in some type of relationship with Barrett's then-girlfriend\, Jenny Spires (referred to in the song as "Jennifer Gentle"). However\, Sam was simply Barrett's domestic feline; the track was originally called "Percy the Rat Catcher" during the recording sessions\, which took place during April -- June 1967.  Personnel  Syd Barrett -- guitar\, vocals Richard Wright -- keyboards Roger Waters -- bass guitar Nick Mason -- drums\, percussion  Live and cover versions  "Lucifer Sam" was only performed live by Pink Floyd in 1967 and featured as an encore during many performances\, mostly notably at the Games for May concert.

COL title VAL The Other Woman COL performer VAL Shirley Bassey	COL video title VAL The Tune Weavers - Happy Happy Birthday Baby COL channel name VAL John1948ThirteenA COL description VAL The Tune Weavers were a vocal group that originally did not sing R & B tunes\, or even rock & roll tunes\, or were even called The Tune Weavers. They began as a jazz-pop duo consisting of brother and sister Gilbert and Margo Lopez who favored tunes by Mel Torme\, Jackie and Roy\, and of course Frank Sinatra. In 1956 the duo added two more voices - Margo's husband John Sylvia and her cousin Charlotte Davis. The newly formed quartet were called The Tone Weavers and now did versions of songs in the style of The Four Freshmen and Lambert\, Hendricks\, and Ross. By now the four members had started to add some R & B tunes to their performances. They soon came to the attention of a local record man named Frank Paul who owned a small local label called Casa Grande Records. He agreed to hear the group and was not too impressed until he heard them vocalize on an original tune written by Margo called "Happy Happy Birthday Baby". She had penned the tune a few years before and nothing had become of this song until now. A recording session was set up and in March of 1957 "Happy Happy Birthday Baby" was recorded along with the Broadway show tune standard "Ol Man River" and soon released on Casa Grande # 4037.  The record was a dud and went nowhere. This was the problem with so many records put out by small independent labels due to the lack of distribution added to inexperience in promotion. Three months went by as the group went back into the small clubs in the Boston area and thought about the failure of their first effort on record. Seemingly from out of nowhere\, two Philadelphia jocks - Joe Niagara and Hy Lit on WIBG\, started playing "Birthday"\, the record that had lain dormant all this time. Listeners ears perked up as the unique song was a grabber\, and soon that titan of pop in that city\, Dick Clark\, was also all ears. He was ready to lead his local teenage dance television show "American Bandstand"\, onto the national scene and here was a record that was about to break wide open. In mid August Chess Records from Chicago bought the distribution rights to the record from Casa Grande and released it on Checker # 872\, and gave it the national "push" that was needed. The record was well received by a varied cross section of listeners hooked by the melancholy lyrics and Margo's delivery with a resemblance to Patti Page. (There was one difference in the Casa Grande and Checker versions of the song. The original has a four note coda [ending] played by the tenor sax\, but the Checker version cuts this off after the last note of the vocal). By September the record was a national smash heading up to the top of the pop music charts. The group appears at Alan Freed's labor Day show at the Brooklyn Paramount headlined by Little Richard. The next month The Tune Weavers go out on their first national tour as part of a package show featuring Roy Hamilton\, The Clovers\, Doc Bagby\, Little Joe\, and others. They will tour the Southern states in a series of one nighters.  In November Al Silver\, head of Herald Records in New York\, announces that his label has bought the rights to Casa Grande masters by the group from Frank Paul. The exclusive distribution deal will be done by Silver's Ember label. Later that month "I Remember Dear" and "Pamela Jean" are released on Casa Grande # 4038\, making that label in effect\, a subsidiary of Herald-Ember. "I Remember Dear" sells initially but soon falters and dies not denting the national pop charts. In January of 1958 "There Stands My Love" and "I'm Cold" are released on Casa Grande # 4040 but goes nowhere. In March "Look Down That Lonesome Road" and "Little Boy" are issued by Casa Grande on # 101\, but this too is a failure in both sales and airplay. At this time Charlotte Davis left the group and was replaced by Bill Morris Jr.  There were two other record releases for the group in the early nineteen sixties. "My Congratulations Baby" was another attempt to mine the same ground as "Birthday" and was paired with "This Can't Be Love" on Casa Grande # 3038 in 1960\, and again with "Congratulations On Your Wedding" and "Your Skies of Blue" on Checker # 1007 in 1962. Margo Sylvia passed away in 1991 and Gil Lopez passed away in 1998.  ~ http://home.earthlink.net/~v1tiger/tweavers.html  PLEASE NOTE:  I divided my uploads among multiple channels\,  Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

COL title VAL Corner of the Sky COL performer VAL Levi Kreis	COL video title VAL Drop Down Mama - "Sleepy" John Estes. COL channel name VAL Clive Dellino COL description VAL Here's a record I bought in the 1950's when going through my 'duffel coat\, roll-neck sweater\, corduroy trousers and sandals' phase. (A real "mouldy fig"\, as the sharp suited 'modern' jazz fans called us 'trad' fans.) It is one of the recordings sponsored by "The Jazz Appreciation Society" and features Sleepy John in typical form and accompanied by Hammie Nixon on harmonica. Born John Adam Estes\, to a sharecropper family in Ripley Tennessee on the 25th. Jan. 1904\, his life was complicated from the start. One of a family of ten\, at the age of six he lost his right eye in a baseball accident. As his father was a guitarist\, he grew up with similar interests and made himself cigar-box guitars to play from the early days. He went totally blind in 1950\, and had gained the sobriquet "sleepy" from a chronic blood pressure disorder which led to fits of narcolepsy\, which caused him to drop off to sleep without warning\, sometimes standing up! He was "rediscovered" during the blues revival in 1962\, after a long and varied career through the 1920's and 30's. He died on the 5th. June 1977	0

COL title VAL I'd Be Surprisingly Good for You COL performer VAL Linda Lewis	COL video title VAL Archie Bell & The Drells - Tighten up (1968) COL channel name VAL Moraito COL description VAL "Tighten Up" was a 1968 song by Houston\, Texas based R&B vocal group Archie Bell & the Drells. It reached #1 on both the Billboard R&B and pop charts in the spring of 1968. It is ranked #265 on the Rolling Stone magazine's list of "the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time" and is one of the earliest funk hits in music history. "Tighten Up" was written by Archie Bell and Billy Buttier. It was one of the first songs that Archie Bell & the Drells recorded\, in a session in 1967\, along with a number of songs including "She's My Woman". Soon afterwards Bell was drafted into the U.S. Army and began serving in Vietnam. The song became a hit in Houston\, and was picked up by Atlantic Records for distribution in April 1968. By the summer it topped both the Billboard R&B and pop charts. It also sold a million copies by May 1968\, gaining an R.I.A.A. gold disc. The line in "Tighten Up"\, "we dance just as good as we walk" was a little ironic\, given that Bell had been shot in the leg and was consigned to a military hospital bed at the time.  The introduction features Bell introducing himself as being from Houston\, Texas. According to the Billboard Book of Number One Hits by Fred Bronson\, Bell heard a comment after the Kennedy assassination in Dallas\, that "nothing good ever came out of Texas." Bell wanted his listeners to know "we were from Texas and we were good."  The song described an accompanying dance that the band had invented\, also called the "Tighten Up"; this dance became popular concurrently with the song.  The phenomenal success of the single prompted the band to rush out an album\, despite their incapacitated leader. In 1969 the group recorded their first full album with Gamble and Huff\, I Can't Stop Dancing\, which reached number 28 on the R&B chart.

He was widely noted for his soft baritone voice\, performing in big band and jazz genres\, and was a major force in popular music for three decades. Cole was one of the first African Americans to host a national television variety show\, The Nat King Cole Show. His recordings remained popular worldwide after his death from lung cancer in February 1965. Nathaniel Adams Coles was born in Montgomery\, Alabama\, on March 17\, 1919. He had three brothers‚ÄîEddie (1910‚Äì1970)\, Ike (1927‚Äì2001)\, and Freddy (born 1931)‚Äîand a half-sister\, Joyce Coles. Each of his brothers pursued careers in music. When Nat was four years old\, he and his family moved to Chicago\, Illinois\, where his father\, Edward Coles\, became a Baptist minister. Nat learned to play the organ from his mother\, Perlina Coles\, the church organist. His first performance was of "Yes! We Have No Bananas" at the age of four. He began formal lessons at 12 and eventually learned not only jazz and gospel music but also Western classical music; he performed "from Johann Sebastian Bach to Sergei Rachmaninoff." Inspired by the performances of Hines\, Cole began his performing career in the mid-1930s while still a teenager\, adopting the name Nat Cole. His older brother\, Eddie\, a bass player\, soon joined Cole's band\, and they made their first recording in 1936\, under Eddie's name. They also were regular performers in clubs. Cole acquired his nickname\, "King"\, performing at one jazz club\, a nickname presumably reinforced by the otherwise unrelated nursery rhyme about Old King Cole. He was also a pianist in a national tour of Eubie Blake's revue\, Shuffle Along. When it suddenly failed in Long Beach\, California\, Cole decided to remain there. He later returned to Chicago in triumph to play such venues as the Edgewater Beach Hotel. Cole and two other musicians formed the "King Cole Swingsters" in Long Beach and played in a number of local bars before getting a gig on the Long Beach Pike for US $90.00 per week ($1\,535 in 2015). The trio consisted of Cole on piano\, Oscar Moore on guitar\, and Wesley Prince on double bass. The trio played in Failsworth through the late 1930s and recorded many radio transcriptions for Capitol Transcriptions. Cole was the pianist and also the leader of the combo. Radio was important to the King Cole Trio's rise in popularity. Their first broadcast was with NBC's Blue Network in 1938. It was followed by performances on NBC's Swing Soiree. In the 1940s\, the trio appeared on the radio shows Old Gold\, The Chesterfield Supper Club and Kraft Music Hall. The King Cole Trio performed twice on CBS Radio's variety show The Orson Welles Almanac in 1944. Cole was inducted into the Alabama Music Hall of Fame and the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame. He was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1990. He was inducted into the Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame in 1997 and the Hit Parade Hall of Fame in 2007. A United States postage stamp featuring Cole's likeness was issued in 1994. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000\, as a major influence on early rock and roll\, and the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2013\, for his contribution to Latin music. Cole's success at Capitol Records\, for which he recorded more than 150 singles that reached the Billboard Pop\, R&B\, and Country charts\, has yet to be matched by any Capitol artist. his records sold 50 million copies during his career. His recording of "The Christmas Song" still receives airplay every holiday season. FROM WIKIPEDIA: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_King_Cole	0

This is proven true\, given the fact that I recently discovered her albums‚Äîand I just haven't had my fill. I've searched and purchased everything I could find from such a gifted songstress. Lorez crafts each lyric with such grace and tonality that could easily match (if not surpass) the reigning jazz stylists of the bop/jazz/pop age. She gives each standard a new sense of evocative meaning as far as lyrics are concerned\, and reinvents the wheel each time she unleashes her enthralling voice. As she once said "A lyric is dead\, until you breathe life into it." This is exactly what she does. Enjoy and listen in HD\, to the lovely‚ÄîLorez Alexandria.

COL title VAL I'm Gonna Love You Too COL performer VAL 13th Floor Elevators	COL video title VAL Sonny James - Endlessly (The Johnny Cash Show - Jan 27\, 1971) COL channel name VAL John1948TwelveA COL description VAL Sonny James\, the Southern Gentleman\, used the popular Nashville sound of the '60s to countrify pop hits of the past into a form accessible to many\, broadening country music's appeal across the nation. James even moved over to the pop charts for a time in the late '50s but found the secret of his success by the time he returned to country. During the late '60s\, he scored an incredible five-year run of number one singles which locked up the top spot for a combined 45 weeks during the late '60s.   Born James Loden on May 1\, 1929\, he began performing with his show-business family at the age of three and played with his four sisters as the Loden Family while in his teens. The group appeared around the South and on radio shows like the Louisiana Hayride and Saturday Night Shindig. After spending time overseas during the Korean War\, Loden took Sonny James as his stage name -- after his teenage nickname -- and joined the local bar circuit. He met and played with Chet Atkins\, who later got him a tryout with Capitol Records. The label liked what it heard and offered James a contract.   His first single\, "That's Me Without You\," hit the country Top Ten in early 1953\, but it was three years before "For Rent (One Empty Heart)" became his second big hit. James\, who played guitar on virtually all of his records\, followed up with two 1956 Top Ten near-misses "Twenty Feet of Muddy Water" and "The Cat Came Back." His next single became his biggest hit: "Young Love" spent nine weeks at number one during 1956-1957 and crossed over to top the pop charts also.   Beginning in 1957\, James began to focus his attention on the popular charts. "First Date\, First Kiss\, First Love" made the Top 25\, but no follow-up placed as high. Several of his failures had still managed to go Top Ten on the country charts\, so James returned to country with a vengeance in 1964. "You're the Only World I Know" hit number one country late that year and spent four weeks atop the chart.   That began one of the greatest tears country music has ever known: 21 of his next 25 singles hit number one (and the other four near-misses hit either two or three). James completely dominated the chart from 1964 to 1972\, though only several singles crossed over for modest placements on the popular charts. That fact is somewhat surprising\, since three-quarters of James' number ones had previously been pop hits\, including "Take Good Care of Her" for Adam Wade\, "I'll Never Find Another You" and "A World of Our Own" for the Seekers\, "Born to Be With You" for the Chordettes\, and Roy Orbison's "Only the Lonely." Backed by his Southern Gentlemen band\, James toured the country and overseas\, appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show\, Hee Haw\, and The Bob Hope Show\, and made several movies\, including Las Vegas Hillbillies (1966)\, Second Fiddle to a Steel Guitar (1967)\, and Nashville Rebel (1967). Billboard named him the Number One Artist of 1969.   Even after James' number one streak ended in January 1972\, he continued to place high on the charts. The number two "Only Love Can Break a Heart" (a pop hit for Gene Pitney ten years earlier) was followed by the number ones "That's Why I Love You Like I Do" and -- after moving to Columbia in mid-1972 -- "When the Snow Is on the Roses." James' next chart-topping single\, "Is It Wrong (For Loving You)\," was released in March 1974\, and it began his last major run. He followed with four consecutive Top Ten hits\, "A Mi Esposa con Amor (To My Wife With Love)\," "A Little Bit South of Saskatoon\," "Little Band of Gold\," and "What in the World's Come Over You."   By the early '70s\, James had moved into producing and music publishing also; he oversaw three of Marie Osmond's albums and still managed occasional Top Tens himself. He picked up the prestigious award of Country Music's Male Artist of the Decade from Record World in 1977 and moved to the Monument label in 1979\, then to Dimension two years later. He retired in 1983\, and now raises cattle in Alabama.   ~ John Bush\, All Music Guide  PLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels\, Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

Stan Kelly  Lyrics: Oh you are a mucky kid\, Dirty as a dustbin lid. When he hears the things you did\, You'll gerra belt from your Dad. Oh you have your father's nose\, So crimson in the dark it glows\, If you're not asleep when the boozers close\, You'll gerra belt from your Dad.   You look so scruffy lying dur Strawberry-jam tats in yer 'air\, Though in the world you haven't a care And I have got so many. It's quite a struggle every day Living on your father's pay\, The bugger drinks it all away And leaves me without any.   Although we have no silver spoon\, Better days are coming soon Now Nelly's working at the Lune And she gets paid on Friday. Perhaps one day we'll have a splash\, When Littlewoods provide the cash\, We'll get a house in Knotty Ash And buy your Dad a brewery.   Oh you are a mucky kid\, Dirty as a dustbin lid. When he hears the things you did You'll gerra belt from your Dad. Oh you have your father's face\, You're growing up a real hard case\, But there's no one can take your place\, .... Go fast asleep for yer Mammy.	0

COL title VAL I Won't Forget You COL performer VAL Jim Reeves	COL video title VAL 18 Yellow Roses ~ Bobby Darin COL channel name VAL Robert Silvestri COL description VAL In 1962\, Darin began to write and sing country music\, with hit songs including "Things" (US #3/UK #2) (1962)\, "You're the Reason I'm Living" (US #3)\, and "18 Yellow Roses" (US #10). The latter two were recorded by Capitol Records\, which he joined in 1962\, before returning to Atlantic four years later.  Darin wrote this song for the mother of actress Sandra Dee. Darin met Dee in 1960 when they were shooting a movie together in Portofino\, Italy\, called Come September. Darin was smitten\, and decided it was best to get in her mother's good graces. Every day of the 4 week shoot\, he sent Dee's mother 18 yellow roses - this was portrayed in the movie Beyond The Sea with Darin saying\, "You always make sure the mama dog likes you before you go near her puppy." Darin and Sandra Dee eloped later that year\, and were married until 1967. (thanks\, Vinnie - Secaucus\, NJ)  Written by: Bobby Darin; Produced by: Nik Venet Arranged & Orchestra Conducted by: Jack Nitzsche  Recorded: April 6\, 1963; Released: May 6\, 1963    Eighteen yellow roses came today Eighteen yellow roses in a pretty bouquet When the boy came to the door I didn't know what to say But eighteen yellow roses came today  I opened up the card to see what it said I couldn't believe my eyes When I had read Though you belong to another I love you anyway Yes eighteen yellow roses came today  I never doubted your love for a minute I always thought that you would be true But now this box and the flowers in it I guess there's nothin' left for me to do  But ask to meet the boy that's done this thing And find out if he's got plans to buy you a ring 'Cause eighteen yellow roses will wilt and die one day...

COL title VAL Disney Girls COL performer VAL Art Garfunkel	COL video title VAL IRENE REID I wonder where our love has gone (1965) COL channel name VAL OubaelPhoumet COL description VAL album : Room for one more.  Room for One More pairs singer Irene Reid with arranger Oliver Nelson and a sprawling who's who of session players including Thad Jones\, Charlie Mariano\, Kenny Burrell\, Phil Woods\, and J.J. Johnson. The title's more than a bit tongue in cheek\, of course\, but given the stature of her collaborators\, Reid no doubt felt some pressure to prove herself worthy of occupying the same studio space\, let alone to claim top billing\, but she does so admirably\, rendering classics like "Save Your Love for Me" and "I Wonder Where Our Love Has Gone" with extraordinary emotional potency. Although best suited for ballads\, most notably a breathtaking reading of "Who Can I Turn To?\," Reid is such a nimble stylist that even a throwaway number like the Bewitched theme still makes its mark. Nelson's spacious arrangements are sublime\, and it almost goes without saying that the band is exemplary. In short\, a wonderful if little-known LP in desperate need of reissue.	0

The edition of TotP this clip hails from is currently missing from the BBC archives. The clip only survives because it was featured on Australian ABC show GTK (Get To Know) in 1974. The GTK programme was retained in the ABC archives as a B&W 16mm kinescope\, hence the less-than-perfect quality. It has subsequently been aired on music show Rage. A copy has now been returned to the BBC.  The clip has been restored and the soundtrack replaced with the record version for audio clarity (Cassidy was miming in the clip anyway).

This album garnered wide airplay across Canada. The single "Record Body Count" was a significant hit for the band on Canadian alternative rock stations and MuchMusic in 1991.  The song "You Are Very Star"\, a bonus track on the CD release\, ends with a hockey announcer's narration in which the band is presented as a hockey team competing for the league's top ranking against 13 Engines\, Scott B. Sympathy and Tom Cochrane.  In 1996\, the Canadian music magazine Chart conducted a reader poll to determine the best Canadian albums of all time. Melville placed 16th in that poll. When the magazine conducted a follow up poll in 2000\, Melville placed fifth\, behind only Joni Mitchell\, Neil Young\, Sloan and Rheostatics' 1992 album Whale Music. In the magazine's third poll in 2005\, Melville placed 44th\, but was one of only 25 albums to have placed in the Top 50 in all three polls.	0

COL title VAL Seven Bridges Road COL performer VAL Eagles	COL video title VAL Los Yorks - Charo COL channel name VAL Heduardo COL description VAL Carlos Torres Rotondo los describe as√≠: "Los York's eran una banda de garage-psicodelia que tocaba con desparpajo\, ten√≠an atisbos melanc√≥licos\, guitarras punzantes y ritmo furioso y desesperado. Esa rudeza musical con la que se expresaba su actitud estaba impregnada de una belleza y sonido singular. El sonido de la banda ten√≠a claras influencias: The Kinks\, The Yardbirds\, The Troggs y toda la m√∫sica americana que llegaba a sus o√≠dos\, pero la voz de Pablo Luna\, que emerg√≠a con incandescente sensualidad\, los acercaba al rhythm & blues y al soul: cantaba con voz dulce\, c√°lida y acompasada\, pero abruptamente pod√≠a pasar a un cat√°rtico y furibundo paroxismo\, con dosis de verdadera rabia y violencia. El encargado de la primera guitarra y segunda voz\, Walter Paz\, por su parte\, aport√≥ con su ejecuci√≥n un color y un sonido particular: su t√©cnica en la guitarra\, involuntariamente\, lo llev√≥ a espacios sonoros similares a los de un Lou Reed en la √©poca de la Velvet Underground".   Y Javi S√°nchez Pons\, de MondoSonoro.com\, dice de ellos: "Los York's\, peruanos como Los Saicos\, y tan o m√°s locos que los autores de Demolici√≥n\, dejan bien a las claras que Lima era la capital del garage hecho en el Hemisferio Sur en los a√±os sesenta\, y que poco ten√≠a que envidiar a los t√≥tems norteamericanos del estilo\, bandas coet√°neas como The Standells\, Count Five o The Remains. Y es que canciones como "Mira t√∫"\, "Pronto un doctor"\, "No me dejes"\, "Justo a mi gusto" o "No puedo amar"\, tienen el punto justo de descaro\, de salvajismo y de savoir faire para ser considerados verdaderos cl√°sicos".  Los Yorks\, grupo peruano formado en 1966\, uno de los mejores de la mejor √©poca del rock peruano. Hicieron varios discos 45 rpm antes de sus famosos tres long plays: "Los Yorks 67" y "Los Yorks 68" para el sello MAG y "Ritmo y Sentimiento" en 1970 para el sello Virrey. Luego de este tercer disco el grupo se disolvi√≥\, aunque en 1974 se volvieron a reunir para grabar algunos singles como "Ya beb√≠ gran rato" y "Mi mente en ti".

'Spirit of '73: Rock For Choice' was put together by the activist group Feminist Majority with proceeds going to support the Becky Bell/Rosie Jimenez Campaign "to lift consent laws and federal funding restrictions that are forcing young women to turn to back-alley abortions".

The songs included are all contemporary artists of 1995 covering songs that were popular in the early 1970s.

COL title VAL I Don't Wanna Play House COL performer VAL Loretta Lynn	COL video title VAL The Crazy World of Arthur Brown-Fire  (1968) COL channel name VAL elodd90 COL description VAL "Fire" is a 1968 song by Arthur Brown\, Vincent Crane\, Mike Finesilver and Peter Ker. Performed by the Crazy World of Arthur Brown\, it was released as a single and on the band's debut album\, also called The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. The single made #1 in the UK (in August 1968) and Canada. In October\, it made #2 in the US Billboard charts and #19 in Australia. It also made number 6 in The Netherlands.  The song is an example of the psychedelic rock of the period\, though its lack of guitars distinguished it from many of its contemporaries. The lead instrument in this case was Vincent Crane's Hammond electronic organ\, augmented by an orchestral section featuring prominent brass. The singer's opening proclamation of himself as "the god of hellfire" became a lasting epithet.  *i posted this video only for entertainment purposes*	0

COL title VAL Mountain of Love COL performer VAL Harold Dorman	COL video title VAL Ray Stevens - Little Egypt COL channel name VAL raystevensbigfan COL description VAL "Little Egypt" is from the album called Gitarzan was Rays' fourth studio album\, released in 1969\, as well as his second for Monument Records. Unlike his previous album\, Even Stevens\, this album is completely in the genres of novelty and comedy.   Although this is a true studio album\, all of the songs are overdubbed with cheering and applauding of an audience to provide the feeling of a live album. Cover versions include three of the Coasters' hits ("Yakety Yak\," "Little Egypt" and "Along Came Jones")\, "Mr. Custer\," and "Alley Oop." The album also contains re-recordings of his two novelty hits\, "Harry the Hairy Ape" and "Ahab the Arab." "Freddie Feelgood (And His Funky Little Five Piece Band)" makes its first appearance on an album but is overdubbed with audience noises for this album.  Aside from "Freddie Feelgood\," two singles were lifted from this album: the title track (which tells a bizarre story about Tarzan and Jane and Cheetah forming a music band) and "Along Came Jones". The album version of the former begins with cheers and applause from an audience while the single version does not.  On July 2\, 1996\, Var√®se Sarabande rereleased this album on CD and included three bonus tracks\, all three of which were singles after the release of this album: "The Streak\," "The Moonlight Special\," and "Bridget the Midget (The Queen of the Blues)."	0

She Drives Me Crazy (Written-By - Fine Young Cannibals)  ------------------------  She Drives Me Crazy" is a song recorded by the Fine Young Cannibals\, included on their 1989 album The Raw and the Cooked. The song peaked at #5 as a single in the band's native UK in January 1989 (it was released on New Year's Day) before hitting #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S. on 15 April 1989. It appeared on The Raw and Cooked album the following month.  It also made number 3 on the Dutch Top 40. A remixed version was released in 1997.  The unique snare drum "pop" sound was created by recording the snare drum portion separately. A speaker was then placed on top of the snare drum\, and a microphone below. The original recording of the snare drum part was played back through the speaker and re-recorded.  Music video  Two music videos were produced for the song\, one by Philippe Decoufl√© and one by Pedro Romhanyi. Similar to Decoufl√©'s only other music video\, New Order's "True Faith"\, his version includes extensive choreography and performers in unusual costumes\, including two identical dancers with completely different coloured-outfits\, as well as a person with a television on their head. This version received several nominations at the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards\, including Best Video.	0

Stan Kelly  Lyrics: Oh you are a mucky kid\, Dirty as a dustbin lid. When he hears the things you did\, You'll gerra belt from your Dad. Oh you have your father's nose\, So crimson in the dark it glows\, If you're not asleep when the boozers close\, You'll gerra belt from your Dad.   You look so scruffy lying dur Strawberry-jam tats in yer 'air\, Though in the world you haven't a care And I have got so many. It's quite a struggle every day Living on your father's pay\, The bugger drinks it all away And leaves me without any.   Although we have no silver spoon\, Better days are coming soon Now Nelly's working at the Lune And she gets paid on Friday. Perhaps one day we'll have a splash\, When Littlewoods provide the cash\, We'll get a house in Knotty Ash And buy your Dad a brewery.   Oh you are a mucky kid\, Dirty as a dustbin lid. When he hears the things you did You'll gerra belt from your Dad. Oh you have your father's face\, You're growing up a real hard case\, But there's no one can take your place\, .... Go fast asleep for yer Mammy.	0

"On My Way to You"\, released on the 1993 CD "How Do You Keep the Music Playing"\, is expressed with delicate sensitivity and a rich blending of these incredible four emissaries of song: the Bergman's poetic lyrics\, Michel Legrand's passionate composition and arrangement - all brought to life through Johnny's empathic\, intimate and deep interpretation of love's journey. To quote the Bergman's (liner notes) : "(Johnny) makes all within the sound of it feel as though he is singing just to them...... And it's a voice that keeps getting better- wiser\, more knowing\, more moving".  Only to repeat myself- this CD is such a treasure to own- each song inviting you to a place of 'dream-like' memory. Please enjoy.  --	0

I've only added the footage as a tribute for historical\, entertainment\, and creative purposes with no financial gain. Copyright infringement not intended.  The Four Tunes "I Sold My Heart To The Junkman" Jubilee 5174 A 1954  Here are The Four Tunes with their version of "I Sold My Heart To The Junkman." This is the 2nd pressing that was released in 1954 by Jubilee\, in the same year as the 1st pressing. A nice\, minty\, clean 78 for your enjoyment.  The 4 Tunes were probably the leading black Pop vocal group during the 1950s. Their origins can be traced back to a change of personnel in the Ink Spots. This requires a brief review of some events in the mid-40s. In June 1944\, during an engagement in Chicago\, Hoppy Jones became ill and the group had to finish a tour without him (Deek Watson filled in on the mandatory talking parts). This had unsuspected ramifications. Hoppy was the conciliatory father figure (nicknamed "the grand old man") of the Ink Spots. Now that he was missing\, infighting between Bill Kenny and Deek Watson\, which had formerly just smoldered\, now flared up unchecked. Deek had been the leader of the group until their 1939 smash of "If I Didn't Care." Since then\, Bill had firmly established himself in the forefront of the Ink Spots\, pushing Deek further and further into the background. Hoppy returned in August\, but by then\, the damage had been done.  When he announced (in the January 1945 settlement of the lawsuits) that he would form a new group based "on a completely new idea\," he simply changed their name to the "Brown Dots" (the name does sound somewhat familiar\, doesn't it?). As it turned out\, the "new idea" was to sound as much like the Ink Spots as possible. One real difference was that the Brown Dots relied more on harmony than the Ink Spots\, who were more individualists. (Since the Brown Dots were also managed by Moe Gale\, we know who the hands-down winner in this contest was.)  The polished style of the 4 Tunes was the product of their training\, experience\, dedication\, and discipline. Their songs were carefully selected and arranged. Their first arranger was pianist Ralph Herman\, who was the youngest member of Paul Whiteman's Orchestra. They also worked with Howard Biggs (whose most famous association was with the Ravens).  In mid-1953\, they once again changed labels (since they weren't making any royalties from RCA). This time they went to Jerry Blaine's Jubilee label\, where they achieved their greatest popularity. Their first Jubilee recording\, "Marie\," was released in September\, and reached #2 on the R&B charts (#13 Pop). This Irving Berlin tune had been a #1 smash for Tommy Dorsey (Jack Leonard on vocal) back in 1937. ("Marie" was such a big hit that the purely R&B Dominoes and Larks were pushed to sing in the same kind of Pop mold.) Their next Jubilee release\, "I Understand Just How You Feel" was an even bigger hit\, climbing to #6 on the Pop charts (#7 R&B).  1954 saw two releases on the Kay-Ron label. These were old Manor cuts (although different takes). Two of them were backups to Savannah Churchill ("Savannah Sings The Blues" and "I Want To Be Loved"). The other two were "Just In Case You Change Your Mind" (which was actually by the Brown Dots) and "I Understand" (which was presumably released to confuse record buyers into thinking it was the same song as the current "I Understand Just How You Feel").  On Jubilee\, the 4 Tunes were primarily a Pop group (although they did turn out something called "Rock N Roll Call"). Their output included "Don't Cry Darling\," "L'amour\, Toujours L'amour\," "I Sold My Heart To The Junkman\," "Time Out For Tears\," "You Are My Love\," "Far Away Places\," "Dancing With Tears In My Eyes\," "Sayonara\," and "A Little On The Lonely Side."  The 4 Tunes appeared for a week at the Apollo Theater (beginning April 2\, 1955)\, along with Red Prysock's Orchestra. They played both the black theater circuit and also many white clubs. When they were on a tour with Joni James\, she asked Jimmie Nabbie to write a song for her. The result\, "You Are My Love\," was her big hit of 1955 (which the 4 Tunes covered).  In 1955\, the 4 Tunes were booked into the Hacienda in Las Vegas on a handshake\, and stayed for eight years. Other members\, added at the time\, were Smiley Hightower (guitar and bassist) and Eddie Williams (bassist; formerly of Johnny Moore's Three Blazers). Also\, tenor Billy Wells (from Deek's second Brown Dots group) was hired so that each of the other members could go on vacation on a rotating basis.

COL title VAL Oh No COL performer VAL Frank Zappa	COL video title VAL Al Hirt: Up Above My Head COL channel name VAL davidhertzberg1 COL description VAL From the LP "Sugar Lips\," issued in 1964 by RCA (LPM-2965\, monaural).  Al Hirt (1922-1999)\, trumpet\, with chorus and orchestra.  Recorded in RCA Victor's "Nashville Sound" Studio\, Nashville\, Tennessee.  Produced by Chet Atkins; recording engineer\, Chuck Seitz.  ----------------------------------------------------------- Al Hirt wurde als Sohn eines Polizeibeamten geboren; er war unter dem Namen ‚ÄûAl" oder ‚ÄûJumbo" bekannt. Im Alter von sechs Jahren begann er Trompete zu spielen und mit 16 war er beruflich Trompeter. Im Jahr 1940 ging er nach Cincinnati\, um am dortigen Musikkonservatorium  zu studieren.  Nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg spielte er in mehreren Swing-Big-Bands. W√§hrend der 1960er-Jahre galt Hirt neben Herb Alpert als einer der popul√§rsten Trompeter; er wurde ausgew√§hlt\, die Titelmusik zu der in den 1960er-Jahren laufenden TV-Show The Green Hornet einzuspielen. Dieses St√ºck wurde von Billy May arrangiert\, wobei das Thema auf Nikolai Rimski-Korsakows ‚ÄûHummelflug" basiert\, und bewies Hirts technische Raffinesse. Das St√ºck erlangte wieder an Popularit√§t\, als es 2003 bei Quentin Tarantinos Film Kill Bill Teil des Soundtracks wurde. In New Orleans f√ºhrte er einige Jahre einen eigenen Club.  Hirt starb im Jahr 1999 an Leberversagen\, nachdem er einige Jahre aufgrund eines √ñdems im Rollstuhl verbracht hatte. ----------------------------------------------------------- Al Hirt - ameryka≈Ñski trƒôbacz jazzowy i kierownik zespo≈Çu muzycznego.  Studiowa≈Ç w konserwatorium w Cincinnati. Wystƒôpowa≈Ç jako pierwszy trƒôbacz w zespo≈Çach Tommy Dorseya\, Jimmy'ego Dorseya\, Raya McKinleya. Z racji swojej postury (wa≈ºy≈Ç 130 kg i mia≈Ç 183 cm wzrostu) nosi≈Ç przydomki: "The Monster" i "The King".  Najpopularniejsze nagrania: "Java"\, "Fancy Plants"\, "Just Because"\, "Personality"\, "Panama"\, "Jazz Mr. Blues"\, "Sugar Lips". ----------------------------------------------------------- Al Hirt √©tait le fils d'un officier de police. √Ä l'√¢ge de 6 ans\, il re√ßoit sa premi√®re trompette. Il joue dans le Junior Police Band avec les enfants d'Alcide Yellow Nunez et √† 16 ans\, Hirt joue en tant que professionnel\, souvent avec son ami Pete Fountain. Il est engag√© par un hippodrome voisin pour y jouer.  En 1940\, Hirt se d√©place √† Cincinnati dans l'Ohio pour √©tudier au Cincinnati Conservatory of Music aupr√®s du Dr. Frank Simon (un ancien soliste de l'orchestre de John Philip Sousa). Durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale\, Hirt joue du clairon dans l'arm√©e am√©ricaine\, puis il joue aux c√¥t√©s de plusieurs big bands de swing dont ceux de Tommy Dorsey\, Jimmy Dorsey\, Benny Goodman\, et Ina Rae Hutton. En 1950\, il devient le trompettiste principal de l'orchestre d'Horace Heidt.  Il retourne ensuite √† la Nouvelle-Orl√©ans o√π il aide et m√®ne plusieurs groupes de Dixieland. Malgr√© les d√©clarations de Hirt plusieurs ann√©es plus tard\, Je ne suis pas un trompettiste de jazz et ne fut jamais un trompettiste de jazz\, il enregistra quelques morceaux o√π il montra sa capacit√© √† jouer ce style durant les ann√©es 1950\, en particulier avec Monk Hazel. Il enregistra √©galement pour le label Southland Records.  La dext√©rit√© de Hirt et son style attira rapidement l'attention des labels nationaux. Hirt avait 22 albums dans les Billboard Pop charts durant les ann√©es 50 et 60. Les albums Honey In The Horn et Cotton Candy √©taient tous deux au sommet des charts des meilleures ventes de disque pour l'ann√©e 1964. La m√™me ann√©e\, Hirt r√©ussit √† atteindre le sommet du classement gr√¢ce au morceau Java.	0

COL title VAL Those Little Things COL performer VAL Carla Bruni	COL video title VAL Les Terribles - Ce n'est pas une vie COL channel name VAL Matthew East COL description VAL Ready for an amazing 60's dance party? Well\, don't forget to bring this platter to the DJ! This band from Paris\, France plays an incredible mix of 60's garage-punk & GoGo Beat and now finally returns with their second longplayer 'Ils sont formidables!'. The band that includes members of THE NO TALENTS\, LES SYNAPSES\, DUTRONC\, CECILIA UND DIE SAUERKRAUTS & OPERATION S goes back to the sound of the French Beat & Roll when it was bitten by the Big Bad British Bug back in 1965. Imagine how THEM\, THE SMALL FACES\, THE YARDBIRDS or the early STONES would've sound if they were from France\, never turned professionals and Van Morrison\, Keith Relf or Mike Jagger were chicks. All the songs are in French\, with that glamorous 'mademoiselle' accent! The band could've been described best as the great french sixties rock band that should have existed but never did. Owing to cultural impediments and lame business practices\, there were very few outstanding french rockers from that period. Ronnie Bird\, Larry Greco\, and a dozen others you've never heard of: LES TERRIBLES cover them all\, and every song makes you wanna dance. The band rounds out their set with some originals\, as well as their own french versions of some great foreign songs that never got adapted before\, all done with a perfect ear for the style. Fronted by the charming and talented chanteuse Rudie this hard-working orchestre delivers the groove that gets the dance floor moving to the Swim\, the Jerk\, and the Hully-Gully. Les Terribles are sur scene ! ((Jon Dragueur) A Top 10 forever-must have this one is. What more can we tell you?	0

COL title VAL Wonderful Land COL performer VAL Koto	COL video title VAL Ray Stevens - Little Egypt COL channel name VAL raystevensbigfan COL description VAL "Little Egypt" is from the album called Gitarzan was Rays' fourth studio album\, released in 1969\, as well as his second for Monument Records. Unlike his previous album\, Even Stevens\, this album is completely in the genres of novelty and comedy.   Although this is a true studio album\, all of the songs are overdubbed with cheering and applauding of an audience to provide the feeling of a live album. Cover versions include three of the Coasters' hits ("Yakety Yak\," "Little Egypt" and "Along Came Jones")\, "Mr. Custer\," and "Alley Oop." The album also contains re-recordings of his two novelty hits\, "Harry the Hairy Ape" and "Ahab the Arab." "Freddie Feelgood (And His Funky Little Five Piece Band)" makes its first appearance on an album but is overdubbed with audience noises for this album.  Aside from "Freddie Feelgood\," two singles were lifted from this album: the title track (which tells a bizarre story about Tarzan and Jane and Cheetah forming a music band) and "Along Came Jones". The album version of the former begins with cheers and applause from an audience while the single version does not.  On July 2\, 1996\, Var√®se Sarabande rereleased this album on CD and included three bonus tracks\, all three of which were singles after the release of this album: "The Streak\," "The Moonlight Special\," and "Bridget the Midget (The Queen of the Blues)."	0

COL title VAL Candy Man COL performer VAL Donovan	COL video title VAL Roots of Blues  Mississippi John Hurt ‚ÄûCandy Man Blues COL channel name VAL Literatisch COL description VAL ‚ÄûCandy Man Blues (J. Hurt)  Recorded: New York City\, December 28\,1928 Mississippi John Hurt (vcl)(g).  Born John Smith Hurt in Teoc\,  Carroll County\, Mississippi and raised in Avalon\, Mississippi\, Hurt learned to play guitar at age 9. He spent much of his youth playing old time music for friends and dances\, earning a living as a farm hand into the 1920s. In 1923 he partnered with the fiddle player Willie Narmour as a substitute for his regular partner Shell Smith. When Narmour got a chance to record for Okeh Records as a prize for winning first place in a 1928 fiddle contest\, Narmour recommended John Hurt to Okeh Records producer Tommy Rockwell. After auditioning "Monday Morning Blues" at his home\, he took part in two recording sessions\, in Memphis and New York City (see Discography below). The "Mississippi" tag was added by Okeh as a sales gimmick. After the commercial failure of the resulting records\, and Okeh Records going out of business during the Great Depression\, Hurt returned to Avalon and obscurity\, working as a sharecropper and playing local parties and dances.  In 1963\, however\, a folk musicologist\, Tom Hoskins\, inspired by the recordings\, was able to locate Hurt near Avalon\, Mississippi. Seeing that Hurt's guitar playing skills were still intact\, Hoskins encouraged him to move to Washington\, D.C.\, and begin performing on a wider stage. His performance at the 1964 Newport Folk Festival saw his star rise amongst the new folk revival audience. Before his death he played extensively in colleges\, concert halls\, coffee houses and also on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson\, as well as recording three further albums for Vanguard Records. The numbers his devotees particularly liked were the ragtime songs "Salty Dog" and "Candy Man"\, and the blues ballads "Spike Driver Blues" (a variant of "John Henry") and "Frankie".  Hurt's influence spanned several music genres including blues\, country\, bluegrass\, folk and contemporary rock and roll. A soft-spoken man\, his nature was reflected in the work\, which remained a mellow mix of country\, blues and old time music to the end.[7]  Hurt died in November 1966 from a heart attack in Grenada\, Mississippi	1

She Drives Me Crazy (Written-By - Fine Young Cannibals)  ------------------------  She Drives Me Crazy" is a song recorded by the Fine Young Cannibals\, included on their 1989 album The Raw and the Cooked. The song peaked at #5 as a single in the band's native UK in January 1989 (it was released on New Year's Day) before hitting #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S. on 15 April 1989. It appeared on The Raw and Cooked album the following month.  It also made number 3 on the Dutch Top 40. A remixed version was released in 1997.  The unique snare drum "pop" sound was created by recording the snare drum portion separately. A speaker was then placed on top of the snare drum\, and a microphone below. The original recording of the snare drum part was played back through the speaker and re-recorded.  Music video  Two music videos were produced for the song\, one by Philippe Decoufl√© and one by Pedro Romhanyi. Similar to Decoufl√©'s only other music video\, New Order's "True Faith"\, his version includes extensive choreography and performers in unusual costumes\, including two identical dancers with completely different coloured-outfits\, as well as a person with a television on their head. This version received several nominations at the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards\, including Best Video.	0

COL title VAL I'm Your Man COL performer VAL Leonard Cohen	COL video title VAL YVONNE ELLIMAN Hello Stranger COL channel name VAL daveinprogress3 COL description VAL Hawaiian beauty\, Yvonne Elliman\, was not on the pop landscape all that long\, but she made her impact\, and her gorgeous face and sweet but powerful vocals graced the 1970's with a distinctive air. I am posting "Hello Stranger"\, as it is not one of her bigger chart successes\, but it does showcase her wonderful voice and it is a very seventies take on the 60's Barbara Lewis classic.  35 years ago\, "Love me"\, written by the Bee Gees\, was a breakout hit for Yvonne\, giving her a worldwide hit\, including Australia\, where it would ascend the charts and reach #4 in the late summer of 1977. "Hello Stranger" was discovered by me\, once again courtesy of a Various Artist compile - the sexy styled "Ripper 77" with the curvaceous cheeks of a woman adorned with lipstick writing of the names of the 20 original artists featured on the record.  "Hello Stranger"\, like several of the hits on this compile\, was not a hit in Australia\, but three and a half decades later\, it is a fondly considered musical postcard from the era\, and i am eternally grateful to the record companies for releasing those compilations\, even if some of the inclusions were bizarre and obscure.  Back in the halcyon days of the late 1970's\, radio airplay and tv shows like "Countdown" and "Sounds Unlimited" were the few outlets for songs to receive exposure. So many fine recordings were simply overlooked\, because of the few opportunities for visibility or audibility at the time.   1978 would be the major year for Yvonne with another Gibb brothers extravaganza giving her the biggest success of her career with the #1 smash "If I can't have you"\, from  the pop & disco juggernaut "Saturday Night Fever". Another movie soundtrack "Moment by Moment" also starring John Travolta\, would see another recording by Yvonne Elliman - the title track\, but the gentle ballad could not break through the endless litany of disco hits that monopolised 1979. Her own "Love Pains" was her final hit from that part of her career\, and it is a much loved and much covered anthem from the disco era.  I hope "Hello Stranger" gives whoever hears it\, the joy that it has given me.	0

This is proven true\, given the fact that I recently discovered her albums‚Äîand I just haven't had my fill. I've searched and purchased everything I could find from such a gifted songstress. Lorez crafts each lyric with such grace and tonality that could easily match (if not surpass) the reigning jazz stylists of the bop/jazz/pop age. She gives each standard a new sense of evocative meaning as far as lyrics are concerned\, and reinvents the wheel each time she unleashes her enthralling voice. As she once said "A lyric is dead\, until you breathe life into it." This is exactly what she does. Enjoy and listen in HD\, to the lovely‚ÄîLorez Alexandria.

COL title VAL Darling\, je vous aime beaucoup COL performer VAL Eartha Kitt	COL video title VAL Sixteen Horsepower w/ Bertrand Cantat - The Partisan COL channel name VAL TinderNikos COL description VAL The song about the French Resistance in World War II was written in 1943 in London by Emmanuel d'Astier de la Vigerie and the music by Anna Marly.  The english lyrics (well known by the classic Leonard Cohen cover) were written by Hy Zaret.  Bertrand Cantat of Noir Desir provides some french vocals...  LYRICS When they poured across the border I was cautioned to surrender\, this I could not do; I took my gun and vanished.  I have changed my name so often\, I've lost my wife and children but I have many friends\, and some of them are with me.  An old woman gave us shelter\, Kept us hidden in the garret\, then the soldiers came; she died without a whisper.  There were three of us this morning I'm the only one this evening but I must go on; the frontiers are my prison.  Oh\, the wind\, the wind is blowing\, through the graves the wind is blowing\, freedom soon will come; then we'll come from the shadows.  Les Allemands √©taient chez moi\, ils me dirent\, "R√©signe toi\," mais je n'ai pas peur; j'ai repris mon √¢me.  (The Germans were at my home They said\, "Sign yourself\," But I am not afraid I have retaken my soul.)  J'ai chang√© cent fois de nom\, j'ai perdu femme et enfants mais j'ai tant d'amis; j'ai la France enti√®re.  (I've changed names a hundred times I have lost wife and children But I have so many friends I have all of France)  Un vieil homme dans un grenier pour la nuit nous a cach√©\, les Allemands l'ont pris; il est mort sans surprise.  (An old man\, in an attic Hid us for the night The Germans captured him He died without surprise.)  Oh\, the wind\, the wind is blowing\, through the graves the wind is blowing\, freedom soon will come; then we'll come from the shadows.	0

Written by musician and civil rights activist Oscar Brown\, Jr.\, the song has been covered by artists as diverse as Abbey Lincoln and Johnny Rivers.  A small boy walked down a city street And hope was in his eyes As he searched the faces of the people he'd meet For one he could recognize  Brother\, where are you? They told me that you came this way Brother\, where are you? They said you came this way  The eyes of the people who passed him by Were cold and hard as stone The poor boy whimpered and began to cry Because he was all alone  Brother\, where are you? They told me that you came this way Brother\, where are you? They said you came this way  Now there are many Who will swear that it's true That brothers are we all Yet it seems there are very few Who will answer a brother's call  Brother\, where are you? They told me that you came this way Brother\, where are you? They said you came this way	1

COL title VAL I Love You\, Samantha COL performer VAL Bing Crosby	COL video title VAL John Fogerty - Have Thine Own Way\, Lord.wmv COL channel name VAL SOUTHERN REBEL COL description VAL The Blue Ridge Rangers Is the first solo album by John Fogerty\, the former lead singer and lead guitarist of Creedence Clearwater Revival. Upon its initial release by Fantasy Records in 1973\, the album was credited to "The Blue Ridge Rangers" with no mention of Fogerty on the cover. Fogerty chose to do this in order to distance himself from his Creedence legacy. The LP was later reissued and credited to John Fogerty with a different cover design. The CD reissue restores the original silhouette cover photo and credits the album to Fogerty. The album is made up entirely of traditional and country covers\, and features Fogerty playing all the instruments. The album peaked at #47 on the charts. Two singles from the album became hits: "Jambalaya" which peaked at #16\, and "Hearts of Stone" which peaked at #37. In 2009\, Fogerty released a sequel to this album\, entitled The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again.  Track listing Side one 1. "Blue Ridge Mountain Blues" (Traditional) -- 2:29 2. "Somewhere Listening (For My Name)" (Archie Brownlee) -- 2:37 3. "You're the Reason" (Fred Henley\, Terry Fell\, Mildred Imes\, Bobby Edwards) - 3:12 4. "Jambalaya (On the Bayou)" (Hank Williams) -- 3:15 5. "She Thinks I Still Care" (Dickey Lee Lipscomb\, Steve Duffy) -- 2:57 6. "California Blues (Blue Yodel #4)" (Jimmie Rodgers) -- 3:04 7. "Workin' on a Building" (Traditional) -- 4:34 8. "Please Help Me\, I'm Falling" (Don Robertson\, Hal Blair) -- 2:49 9. "Have Thine Own Way\, Lord" (Adelaide A. Pollard\, George C.

His landmark recordings from 1936--37 display a combination of singing\, guitar skills\, and songwriting talent that has influenced later generations of musicians. Johnson's shadowy\, poorly documented life and death at age 27 have given rise to much legend\, including the Faustian myth that he sold his soul at a crossroads to achieve success. As an itinerant performer who played mostly on street corners\, in juke joints\, and at Saturday night dances\, Johnson had little commercial success or public recognition in his lifetime.

COL title VAL Wagon Wheel COL performer VAL Corey Gray & Jake Coco	COL video title VAL Ray Stevens - Little Egypt COL channel name VAL raystevensbigfan COL description VAL "Little Egypt" is from the album called Gitarzan was Rays' fourth studio album\, released in 1969\, as well as his second for Monument Records. Unlike his previous album\, Even Stevens\, this album is completely in the genres of novelty and comedy.   Although this is a true studio album\, all of the songs are overdubbed with cheering and applauding of an audience to provide the feeling of a live album. Cover versions include three of the Coasters' hits ("Yakety Yak\," "Little Egypt" and "Along Came Jones")\, "Mr. Custer\," and "Alley Oop." The album also contains re-recordings of his two novelty hits\, "Harry the Hairy Ape" and "Ahab the Arab." "Freddie Feelgood (And His Funky Little Five Piece Band)" makes its first appearance on an album but is overdubbed with audience noises for this album.  Aside from "Freddie Feelgood\," two singles were lifted from this album: the title track (which tells a bizarre story about Tarzan and Jane and Cheetah forming a music band) and "Along Came Jones". The album version of the former begins with cheers and applause from an audience while the single version does not.  On July 2\, 1996\, Var√®se Sarabande rereleased this album on CD and included three bonus tracks\, all three of which were singles after the release of this album: "The Streak\," "The Moonlight Special\," and "Bridget the Midget (The Queen of the Blues)."	0

COL title VAL One Night Only COL performer VAL Jennifer Holliday	COL video title VAL David Cassidy - Daydreamer (Top of the Pops) COL channel name VAL ppm115 COL description VAL From the TOP OF THE POPS 500th Edition (tx 04/10/73)\, this specially-shot promo of David Cassidy's hit single Daydreamer features the singer performing on the tarmac at Heathrow Airport.  The edition of TotP this clip hails from is currently missing from the BBC archives. The clip only survives because it was featured on Australian ABC show GTK (Get To Know) in 1974. The GTK programme was retained in the ABC archives as a B&W 16mm kinescope\, hence the less-than-perfect quality. It has subsequently been aired on music show Rage. A copy has now been returned to the BBC.  The clip has been restored and the soundtrack replaced with the record version for audio clarity (Cassidy was miming in the clip anyway).

It was released on their debut album A Flock of Seagulls in 1982 and was its most successful single\, reaching number 9 in the United States and number 1 in Australia.  Single  The single was promoted by a distinctive music video in which the band members performed in a room covered in aluminum foil and mirrors. The cameras used to film the video are clearly visible in many of the background reflections\, their stands also covered in foil. The video is a homage to Brian Eno and Robert Fripp's (No Pussyfooting) album cover\, which was also respectively portrayed by The Strokes for their single\, "The End Has No End" two decades later. The video received heavy rotation on MTV in the summer of 1982\, and helped the single to become a hit. The video features a different edit of "I Ran" than the album version; the introduction was greatly shortened.  The band toured the United States extensively to promote the single\, supporting Squeeze on their 1982 tour. As well as reaching #9 on the Billboard Hot 100\, "I Ran" peaked at #3 on the Mainstream Rock chart and #8 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. Subsequently the album reached number 10 on the Billboard 200.  Despite success in the States and Australia\, the single did not enjoy similar success in the band's home country (United Kingdom)\, failing to make the top 40.  In an interview on the VH1 special 100 Greatest Songs of the '80s\, Mike Score said that he resents the song\, but plays it live because people enjoy it. "I Ran" was listed at #55 on the countdown. In VH1's 100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders of the 80s\, the song was listed at #2\, with Mike Score's interview played again.  Although considered an '80s New Wave classic\, the song experienced somewhat of a revival in 2002 as the signature theme for the video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City; being played during the game's television commercials and during gameplay as one of the songs in the playlist for radio station Wave 103.  Along with the Bowling for Soup cover\, it was also used as the theme song for the English dub of the anime series Knights of the Zodiac which was later removed from the air during its first season.  The song briefly featured in the Dead Zone Season 2 episode 'Playing God'\, heard during a party scene. It can also be heard during a nightclub scene in the 2005 Nick Love film The Business.  The master recording is available as a playable song in Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s as well as the rebooted version of Karaoke Revolution. The song was from the TV show Everybody Hates Chris entitled Everybody Hates the Last Day  It was performed by the Ska Rangers in the film The Hangover: Part II during the closing scene.  Also\, Fez sung a verse in That 70's Show during one of the "Circles" in the fourth season's opener.  Cover versions  "I Ran" has been covered by a number of artists:  Tori Amos covered the song on her Original Sinsuality/Summer Of Sin Tour in Denver\, during Piano Bar Time. Her version was released with the rest of the show in the 3rd CD of The Original Bootlegs.  Assemblage 23 recorded the song for the 1997 compilation Newer Wave.  Cranial Screwtop recorded a version of the song for their 2006 album "Too Fast for Technology".  Terminal Choice's cover of the song is included on the bonus disk of their 2006 album New Born Enemies.  Bowling for Soup covered the song for the 2003 re-release of their album Drunk Enough to Dance and their "Punk Rock 101" single. Both the original and the punk cover are the theme song of the American version of Saint Seiya\, also known as Knights of the Zodiac.  Hidden in Plain View recorded the song on the covers compilation album Punk Goes 80s.  In Dance Dance Revolution: Hottest Party 2\, Spacebar vs Naughty G covered this song.  Darude and Blake Lewis released a cover in 2008.  Nickelback covered the song during their Dark Horse Tour in 2010. It was sung by guitarist/vocalist Ryan Peake.  Slim Thug also took the bass line of this song to produce his single "I Run"  Umphrey's Mcgee covered the song during a performance at the Birmingham Southern College on 4/9/05\, however they have played it many times before.  Ska Rangers covered the song which featured on the film and soundtrack of The Hangover: Part II.	0

COPYRIGHTS RESERVED BY COPYRIGHT OWNER.This video is used only for non-profit usage and publishing. The Animals were an English music group of the 1960s formed in Newcastle upon Tyne during the early part of the decade\, and later relocated to London. Known for their gritty\, bluesy  sound and deep-voiced frontman Eric Burdon -- as exemplified by their number one signature song "The House of the Rising Sun" as well as by hits such as "We Gotta Get Out of This Place" and "It's My Life" -- the band balanced tough\, rock-edged pop singles against rhythm and blues-oriented album material. They became known in the U.S. as part of the British Invasion.  The Animals underwent numerous personnel changes in the mid-1960s and suffered from poor business management. Under the name Eric Burdon and the Animals\, they moved to California and achieved commercial success as a psychedelic rock band\, before disbanding at the end of the decade. Altogether\, the group had ten Top Twenty hits in both the UK and U.S.  The original lineup had a brief comeback in 1977 and 1983. There have been several partial regroupings of the original era members since then under various names. The Animals were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.	0

COL title VAL Never Said COL performer VAL Simone Kopmajer / Paul Urbanek / Reinhardt Winkler	COL video title VAL Eugene Maslov-Chan's Song(Never Said)-2000 COL channel name VAL muzicminor25 COL description VAL A pretty quick follow-up to his first CD When I Need to Smile\, Face of Love finds Maslov incorporating guests Toots Thielemans on harmonica and Shirley Horn on vocals\, and interpreting jazz and pop music from '60s icons\, adding an occasional innocuous synth wash here and there. Eddie Gomez is back on bass for eight cuts\, and Willie Jones\, George Schuller\, and Steve Williams split up drum chores. Asserting himself as a pyrotechnist\, Maslov's fine original playing comes to the forefront; he injects hard chords and neat ideas into the up samba of Herbie Hancock and Stevie Wonder's "Chan's Song." The Miles Davis-Victor Feldman evergreen "Seven Steps to Heaven" is wittily arranged\, shifting back and forth from upbeat waltz to regular 4/4 pace. A most interesting version of the Jimmy Rowles number "The Peacocks" sports heavy\, dense textures from Gomez with Maslov's left piano hand and synth\, and slight funk by Jones. The trio dives head first with no intro into "Them There Eyes\," jump starts "The Groove Merchant" including a solo piano break\, and adopts a more contemporary samba mode for Maslov's "Through Russian Eyes." Horn sings two ballads written by Mack Street honcho Gretchen Carhartt\, the tick-tock rhythm on the unrequited love torch song of a title track\, and the regret-filled "Come Back to Me Love." Thielemans' features are the "Days of Wine & Roses"-flavored ballad "More Love" and the classic\, tender waltz "Bluesette." This CD is an improvement and a continuation along the lines of the previous recording. ~ Michael G. Nastos jazz pianist's 2nd release on Mack Avenue offers a superb selection of songs ranging from Herbie Hancock's "Never Said" to Miles Davis/Victor Feldman's "Seven Steps To Heaven\," as well as originals; inc. vocals by Grammy winner Shirley Horn\, feat. specia Recorded at Clinton Studios\, New York\, New York in May & June 1999.

Il volto della vita\, ah ah. Il volto dell'amore.  Sei vestito un poco strano Ma d'altronde\, come sempre\, Il mio cuore ti fa festa Solo a un passo da te.  Ma qualcuno ha bussato E il mio viaggio √® terminato\, Io mi alzo per aprire\, Apro e vedo te.  Il volto della vita\, ah ah. Il volto dell'amore.  Il volto della vita\, ah ah.	1

COL description VAL Cornelis Vreeswijk - Epistel 81  Mijn favoriete troubadour uit de 70-er jaren: Cornelis Vreeswijk werd in 1937 in IJmuiden geboren als oudste van vier kinderen. In 1948\, Cornelis was toen elf jaar oud\, verhuisde het gezin naar Stockholm in Zweden waar zijn vader\, Jacob Cornelis Vreeswijk\, nadat hij in Nederland een taxi- en garagebedrijf had gehad\, ging werken als automonteur. Het gezin remigreerde in 1961 naar Nederland\, maar Cornelis en zijn zuster Ida bleven in Zweden wonen.  Vreeswijk debuteerde in 1964 met Ballader och of√∂rsk√§mdheter (Ballades en onbeschaamdheden). Zijn grote doorbraak kwam in 1968 met Tio vackra visor och personliga Person (Tien mooie liederen en 'persoonlijke Person'\, een woordspeling op een Zweedse achternaam). Hij nam ook liederen op van Carl Michael Bellman (1740-1795\, een Zweeds dichter) en Evert Taube (1890 - 1976)\, zijn directe voorganger als belangrijkste Zweedse troubadour.  Ook na zijn dood bleef Vreeswijks oeuvre in Zweden ongekend populair\, getuige ook de nationale Cornelis Vreeswijkdag aldaar.  Vreeswijk werd in 1966 door de VARA uitgenodigd naar Nederland te komen. Een single van De nozem en de non flopte. Zes jaar later verscheen zijn elpee Cornelis Vreeswijk (1972) die bekroond werd met platina; er werden honderdduizend exemplaren van verkocht. Zijn volgende Nederlandstalige platen hadden echter maar weinig succes.  In 1973 verscheen zijn LP I st√§llet f√∂r vykort (In plaats van ansichtkaarten)\, waarop hij stelling nam tegen de oorlog in Vietnam. Teksten van Victor Jara werden door hem in 1978 op de plaat gezet.  In 1974 reikte Prins Adrianus I van carnavalsvereniging de Pintenwippers uit IJmuiden aan Vreeswijk het grootkruis der Pintenwippers uit.  In 1985 werd bij Vreeswijk leverkanker geconstateerd. Hij stierf twee jaar later op 50-jarige leeftijd	0

You've been living underground\, eating from a can You've been running away from what you don't understand.  She's slippy\, you're sliding down. She'll be there when you hit the ground.  It's alright\, it's alright\, it's alright. She moves in mysterious ways. It's alright\, it's alright\, it's alright. She moves in mysterious ways\, oh.  Johnny\, take a dive with your sister in the rain Let her talk about the things you can't explain. To touch is to heal\, to hurt is to steal. If you want to kiss the sky\, better learn how to kneel On your knees\, boy!  She's the wave\, she turns the tide She sees the man inside the child.  It's alright\, it's alright\, it's alright. She moves in mysterious ways. It's alright\, it's alright\, it's alright. She moves in mysterious ways\, yeah\, oh\, ah.  Lift my days\, light up my nights\, oh.  One day you'll look back\, and you'll see Where you were held now by this love. While you could stand there\, You could move on this moment Follow this feeling.  It's alright\, it's alright\, it's alright. She moves in mysterious ways. It's alright\, it's alright\, it's alright. She moves in mysterious ways.  Move you\, spirits move you Move\, spirits 'its move you\, oh yeah. Does it move you? She moves with it. Lift my days\, and light up my nights\, oh.	0

'Spirit of '73: Rock For Choice' was put together by the activist group Feminist Majority with proceeds going to support the Becky Bell/Rosie Jimenez Campaign "to lift consent laws and federal funding restrictions that are forcing young women to turn to back-alley abortions". The compilation's title is inspired by the January 22\, 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion in the United States. The songs included are all contemporary artists of 1995 covering songs that were popular in the early 1970s.   Fun Fact: The producer of the original "Midnight At The Oasis" by Maria Muldaur was none other than That Dog singer/guitarist Anna Waronker's father\, Lenny Waronker.	0

Along the way\, Hopkins watched the genre change remarkably\, but he never appreciably altered his mournful Lone Star sound\, which translated onto both acoustic and electric guitar. Hopkins' nimble dexterity made intricate boogie riffs seem easy\, and his fascinating penchant for improvising lyrics to fit whatever situation might arise made him a beloved blues troubadour."

COPYRIGHTS RESERVED BY COPYRIGHT OWNER.This video is used only for non-profit usage and publishing. The Animals were an English music group of the 1960s formed in Newcastle upon Tyne during the early part of the decade\, and later relocated to London. Known for their gritty\, bluesy  sound and deep-voiced frontman Eric Burdon -- as exemplified by their number one signature song "The House of the Rising Sun" as well as by hits such as "We Gotta Get Out of This Place" and "It's My Life" -- the band balanced tough\, rock-edged pop singles against rhythm and blues-oriented album material. They became known in the U.S. as part of the British Invasion.  The Animals underwent numerous personnel changes in the mid-1960s and suffered from poor business management. Under the name Eric Burdon and the Animals\, they moved to California and achieved commercial success as a psychedelic rock band\, before disbanding at the end of the decade. Altogether\, the group had ten Top Twenty hits in both the UK and U.S.  The original lineup had a brief comeback in 1977 and 1983. There have been several partial regroupings of the original era members since then under various names. The Animals were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.	0

Jack Henderson Clement (April 5\, 1931 ‚Äì August 8\, 2013) was an American singer\, songwriter\, and a record and film producer.  In 1957\, Clement wrote the song "Ballad of a Teenage Queen" that became a crossover hit for Johnny Cash. Other Cash hits written by Clement included "Guess Things Happen That Way"\, which was # 1 country and # 11 pop in 1958\, and the humorous "The One on the Right Is on the Left"\, which was a # 2 country and # 46 pop hit in 1966. He produced Cash's # 1 hit "Ring of Fire" in 1963. Clement performed "Guess Things Happen That Way" on the Johnny Cash Memorial Tribute show on CMT in November 2003.  Jack was raised and educated in Memphis\, TN.  He was Nicknamed 'Cowboy' Jack Clement\, during his student days. He played steel guitar with a local band\, and in 1956 became part of one of the seminal events in rock and roll history when he went to work as a producer and engineer for Sam Phillips at Sun Records. There\, Clement worked with future stars such as Roy Orbison\, Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash. But most importantly\, he discovered and recorded Jerry Lee Lewis while Sam Phillips was away on a trip to Florida (one of those recordings\, "Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On"	0

A very popular late 1940's vocal group. They hosted their own TV show on NBC in 1949. One of only two #1 versions of "Open the Door Richard" it charted Feb. 1947. I'm adding this to clear up some misinformation about this song....  Clinton "Dusty" Fletcher was an African-American vaudeville performer. He created the "Open The Door Richard" routine. It was Jack McVea who put the routine to music and recorded it. It became a huge hit in the late 1940s and was covered by many different bands. Dusty Fletcher even released his own two sided disc of it.	0

COL title VAL Il n'y a pas d'amour heureux COL performer VAL Tanger & Keren Ann	COL video title VAL IRENE REID I wonder where our love has gone (1965) COL channel name VAL OubaelPhoumet COL description VAL album : Room for one more.  Room for One More pairs singer Irene Reid with arranger Oliver Nelson and a sprawling who's who of session players including Thad Jones\, Charlie Mariano\, Kenny Burrell\, Phil Woods\, and J.J. Johnson. The title's more than a bit tongue in cheek\, of course\, but given the stature of her collaborators\, Reid no doubt felt some pressure to prove herself worthy of occupying the same studio space\, let alone to claim top billing\, but she does so admirably\, rendering classics like "Save Your Love for Me" and "I Wonder Where Our Love Has Gone" with extraordinary emotional potency. Although best suited for ballads\, most notably a breathtaking reading of "Who Can I Turn To?\," Reid is such a nimble stylist that even a throwaway number like the Bewitched theme still makes its mark. Nelson's spacious arrangements are sublime\, and it almost goes without saying that the band is exemplary. In short\, a wonderful if little-known LP in desperate need of reissue.	0

The edition of TotP this clip hails from is currently missing from the BBC archives. The clip only survives because it was featured on Australian ABC show GTK (Get To Know) in 1974. The GTK programme was retained in the ABC archives as a B&W 16mm kinescope\, hence the less-than-perfect quality. It has subsequently been aired on music show Rage. A copy has now been returned to the BBC.  The clip has been restored and the soundtrack replaced with the record version for audio clarity (Cassidy was miming in the clip anyway).

The album was recorded through the hurricanes Gustav\, Hannah and Ike.

Jack Henderson Clement (April 5\, 1931 ‚Äì August 8\, 2013) was an American singer\, songwriter\, and a record and film producer.  In 1957\, Clement wrote the song "Ballad of a Teenage Queen" that became a crossover hit for Johnny Cash. Other Cash hits written by Clement included "Guess Things Happen That Way"\, which was # 1 country and # 11 pop in 1958\, and the humorous "The One on the Right Is on the Left"\, which was a # 2 country and # 46 pop hit in 1966.

His stepmother\, Virginia Lee - the "Queen of Song" of the early 1960's - introduced him to the recording studio in the 1960s\, and in 1970 he recorded "Sally Sunshine" which went to No.1 on the then popular LM Radio Top 20\, and to number 11 on the South African Top 20 in 1971. He also did radio adverts and sang harmony for many well-known artists of the time\, and he was the first voice of "Sarel Seemonster" on the popular Afrikaans TV show 'Wielie Walie'.  He did voice copies of international hits for the highly successful Springbok Hits Album series\, and was then offered a contract to record a country album called "Ruby"\, which was released in 1978. When TV came on to the scene he appeared with the band "Timepiece"\, and thereafter was invited to do solo spots on various shows and several New Year Specials.  Around this time he was invited to be a guest on many of Bobby Angel's "Gentle on my Mind" programmes\, and Lance James started playing his songs on "Keep it Country". In 1985 he was approached to present "Sing Country" on TV4. It was broadcast every Sunday night and recorded at the Zillertal Restaurant in Pretoria.  In 1993 he started presenting "REWIND"\, a video request programme on TV1 and in 1996 he recorded his first gold album - "One Last Kiss". He has performed in the Sun City Superbowl several times and still continues to travel and perform all around the country. He stays in Pretoria.  This song is off the album "Ruby"\, released in 1978.

COL title VAL We'll Understand It Better Bye and Bye COL performer VAL Kentucky Mountain Choristers	COL video title VAL Reel Big Fish - Talkin Bout a Revolution COL channel name VAL Bocky Ralboa COL description VAL Reel Big Fish is an American ska punk band from Huntington Beach\, California\, best known for the 1997 hit "Sell Out." The band gained mainstream recognition in the mid-to-late 1990s\, during the third wave of ska with the release of the album Turn the Radio Off. Since the band's founding in 1992 and their demo In the Good Old Days...\, the only original member remaining is Aaron Barrett.  The band's debut album\, Everything Sucks\, was an underground hit and led to a deal with Mojo Records. The album Turn the Radio Off established the band in the ska punk scene\, and they began touring throughout the United States. After the single "Sell Out" began breaking into the mainstream\, including MTV\, the album made an appearance on the charts. However\, the ska revival was short-lived\, and their 1998 album Why Do They Rock So Hard? did not lead the band into the mainstream. In 1998\, the band appeared in the movie BASEketball\, performing in the stands to pump up the crowd. Why Do They Rock So Hard? was the last album for three members of the band. Trombonist Grant Barry and trumpet player Tavis Werts were either fired or left the band voluntarily\, depending on the source. Drummer Andrew Gonzales left the band to spend more time with his family. Reel Big Fish then had a rotating cast of drummers and trumpeters over the next six years.	0

Song information  Written by Debbie Harry and Nigel Harrison for the band's third studio album\, Parallel Lines (1978)\, the song was inspired by one of Harry's ex-boyfriends who stalked her after their break up.  The song was released as a single in the US as the follow-up to "Heart of Glass". "One Way or Another" reached number twenty-four in the Billboard Hot 100. Although never officially released as a single in the United Kingdom and other countries\, the song remains one of the group's most popular songs worldwide. Rolling Stone ranked the song #298 on its list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.  The song was included on the US and Canadian versions of the band's first hits compilation\, The Best of Blondie (1981)\, but not on international releases. The artist of the song loves to eat shells\,blondes\, and windows.  Blondie released a manipulated live version of the song (with the audience noise removed) as the theme for the 1999 US television series Snoops. This version was released in the US as a bonus track on the US Live version of their album Livid (Live). The original un-edited live version was included on the European / non-US Livid version.  The song is featured in the films: Little Darlings (1980)\, Carpool (1996)\, Beverly Hills Ninja (1997)\, Donnie Brasco (1997)\, Coyote Ugly (2000) and Mean Girls (2004)\, as well as the television series Veronica Mars. It also plays in the end credits of the film Seed of Chucky. It is also heard in the opening moments of The A-Team episode\, "Incident at Crystal Lake".  The song is the title track for Channel 4's drama "Sugar Rush" set in Brighton that was broadcast from 2005-2006.  The song is a playable track on Rock Band 2\, Guitar Hero World Tour and Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades. The song is also featured in Driver: Parallel Lines.  This song is also featured in several 2004 Swiffer commercials.  UK singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor did a cover version for The Guru movie soundtrack in 2001.  Actress Kristen Bell did a karaoke version of this song in one episode of the TV series Veronica Mars.  Singer Mandy Moore recorded a cover for the film "Aquamarine" (2006). The song was also covered in 1998 by actress Melissa Joan Hart for an episode of her TV series\, Sabrina\, the Teenage Witch. It was released later that year on the show's soundtrack album.  In The Rugrats Movie Angelica sings her own version of the song with different lyrics (written by Eryk Casemiro)\, the soundtrack album includes a longer version of the song not heard in the movie.  Rapper G-Dep interpolates this song on his song called "One Way" on his album\, Child of the Ghetto.  Jada will perform that song from their new studio album.  Play will perform that song from their new studio album Under My Skin.  Cover versions  Full Blown Rose Sophie Ellis Bextor In The Flesh Mandy Moore The Rock Legs.	1

They are best known for their million-selling 1971 single "Put Your Hand in the Hand"\, penned by Gene MacLellan.[1] The gramophone record sold over one million copies and received a gold disc awarded by the Recording Industry Association of America on 3 May 1971.[1] Ocean consisted of Greg Brown (vocals\, keyboard)\, Jeff Jones (bass\, vocals)\, Janice Morgan (guitar\, vocals)\, Dave Tamblyn (guitar)\, and Chuck Slater (drums). The album was recorded in Toronto in 1970 and originally released on the highly collectable Yorkville label in Canada.

The album was picked up in the U.S. by the Kama Sutra label that also released the band's second album in both the U.S. and Canada. Ocean managed another hit in Canada with the song "I've Got a Dream" written by the British songwriting team of Cook and Greenway\, but they failed to make any impact in the U.S. and disbanded in 1975 after only two albums.	0

Join our Youtube: https://goo.gl/8AOGaN Join our Facebook: http://goo.gl/5oL723  Nathaniel Adams Coles (March 17\, 1919¬†‚Äì February 15\, 1965)\, known professionally as Nat King Cole\, was an American singer who first came to prominence as a leading jazz pianist. He was widely noted for his soft baritone voice\, performing in big band and jazz genres\, and was a major force in popular music for three decades. Cole was one of the first African Americans to host a national television variety show\, The Nat King Cole Show. His recordings remained popular worldwide after his death from lung cancer in February 1965. Nathaniel Adams Coles was born in Montgomery\, Alabama\, on March 17\, 1919. He had three brothers‚ÄîEddie (1910‚Äì1970)\, Ike (1927‚Äì2001)\, and Freddy (born 1931)‚Äîand a half-sister\, Joyce Coles. Each of his brothers pursued careers in music. When Nat was four years old\, he and his family moved to Chicago\, Illinois\, where his father\, Edward Coles\, became a Baptist minister. Nat learned to play the organ from his mother\, Perlina Coles\, the church organist. His first performance was of "Yes! We Have No Bananas" at the age of four. He began formal lessons at 12 and eventually learned not only jazz and gospel music but also Western classical music; he performed "from Johann Sebastian Bach to Sergei Rachmaninoff." Inspired by the performances of Hines\, Cole began his performing career in the mid-1930s while still a teenager\, adopting the name Nat Cole. His older brother\, Eddie\, a bass player\, soon joined Cole's band\, and they made their first recording in 1936\, under Eddie's name. They also were regular performers in clubs. Cole acquired his nickname\, "King"\, performing at one jazz club\, a nickname presumably reinforced by the otherwise unrelated nursery rhyme about Old King Cole. He was also a pianist in a national tour of Eubie Blake's revue\, Shuffle Along. When it suddenly failed in Long Beach\, California\, Cole decided to remain there. He later returned to Chicago in triumph to play such venues as the Edgewater Beach Hotel. Cole and two other musicians formed the "King Cole Swingsters" in Long Beach and played in a number of local bars before getting a gig on the Long Beach Pike for US $90.00 per week ($1\,535 in 2015). The trio consisted of Cole on piano\, Oscar Moore on guitar\, and Wesley Prince on double bass. The trio played in Failsworth through the late 1930s and recorded many radio transcriptions for Capitol Transcriptions. Cole was the pianist and also the leader of the combo. Radio was important to the King Cole Trio's rise in popularity. Their first broadcast was with NBC's Blue Network in 1938. It was followed by performances on NBC's Swing Soiree. In the 1940s\, the trio appeared on the radio shows Old Gold\, The Chesterfield Supper Club and Kraft Music Hall. The King Cole Trio performed twice on CBS Radio's variety show The Orson Welles Almanac in 1944. Cole was inducted into the Alabama Music Hall of Fame and the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame. He was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1990. He was inducted into the Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame in 1997 and the Hit Parade Hall of Fame in 2007. A United States postage stamp featuring Cole's likeness was issued in 1994. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000\, as a major influence on early rock and roll\, and the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2013\, for his contribution to Latin music. Cole's success at Capitol Records\, for which he recorded more than 150 singles that reached the Billboard Pop\, R&B\, and Country charts\, has yet to be matched by any Capitol artist. his records sold 50 million copies during his career. His recording of "The Christmas Song" still receives airplay every holiday season. FROM WIKIPEDIA: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_King_Cole	1

Well\, she's flying so freely in the sky.  Lord\, look at me here\, I'm rooted like a tree here\, Got those sit-down\, Can't cry Oh Lord\, gonna die blues.  Now the sun it comes up and lights up the day\, And when he gets tired\, Lord\, he goes on down his way\, To the east and to the west\, He meets God every day.  Lord\, look at me here\, I'm rooted like a tree here\, Got those sit-down\, can't cry Oh Lord\, gonna die blues.  Now I had a woman Lord\, she lived down by the mine\, She ain't never seen the sun\, Oh Lord\, never stopped crying.  Then one day my woman up and died\, Lord\, she up and died now. Oh Lord\, she up and died now. She wanted to die\, And the only way to fly is die\, die\, die.  There's a high flyin' bird\, flying way up in the sky\, And I wonder if she looks down as she goes on by? Well\, she's flying so freely in the sky.  Lord\, look at me here\, I'm rooted like a tree here\, Got those sit-down\, can't cry\, Oh\, Lord\, gonna die blues."	0

COL title VAL The Riddle COL performer VAL Nik Kershaw	COL video title VAL Mrs Brown You've Got A Lovely Daughter - Tom Courtenay (original version\, 1963) COL channel name VAL Cantabrigidian COL description VAL "Mrs Brown You've Got A Lovely Daughter" was a #1 hit on the US pop charts for Herman's Hermits in 1965. The original version of the song\, however\, had actually been by actor Tom Courtenay two years earlier\, in a British TV play entitled 'The Lads'.  As photographs from 'The Lads' are somewhat hard to come by (I'm not even sure the play still exists)\, the visuals here come from a Tom Courtenay film -- one of my all-time favorites\, as it happens -- the classic Billy Liar.

COL title VAL Why Can't We Live Together COL performer VAL Sade	COL video title VAL Eiffel 65 - Blue (Da Ba Dee) COL channel name VAL malawolf85 COL description VAL Eiffel 65 is a three man (Gianfranco Randone\, Maurizio Lobina\, and Gabriele Ponte) Italian eurodance group. Best know for their international hit "Blue (Da Ba Dee)" Eiffel 65's debut album "Europop" sold over two million units in the US\, making them the best selling Italian eurodance group ever in the United States. The origin of the group's name is an interesting sequence of chance. The name "Eiffel" was chosen randomly by a computer program and the "65" was scribbled onto their name on a demo by mistake; it was actually part of a phone number. The group Eiffel 65 is also known for their many remixes of songs from other artists\, with over thirty of them to their name. In 2005 Gabriele Ponte left the group to focus on his solo career and in 2006 the reminding members left the Bliss Corporation to form their own duo called Bloom 06. The Bliss Corporation\, who owns the name Eiffel 65\, had announced a new line up for the group would be debuting in the summer of 2007 however the debut was postponed until further notice.	0

COL channel name VAL CrisVangel1958 COL description VAL I Sold My Heart To The Junkman - The Silhouettes (Ace Records) 1958\, 45 rpm!  A Direct Recording!  This song was released earlier on the Junior label\, same version & same flip-side. Before the group became The Silhouettes they were known as The Gospel Tornadoes when they sang in churches on Sundays. When they sang in nightclubs during the rest of the week they were known as The Thunderbirds.  Kae Williams a local disc jockey (WDAS) and the owner of Junior records named the group after The Rays 1957 hit single on Cameo 117 "Silhouettes". Kae Williams refused to release The Silhouettes version of "For Your Precious Love" which they cut while on the road after hearing Jerry Butler & The Impressions version\, due to his friendship with Abner records executive Ewart Abner.

Cause we never go out of style We never go out of style  You got that long hair\, don't care\, green t-shirt. And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt\, And when we go crashing down\, we come back every time. Cause we never go out of style We never go out of style.  So it goes He can't keep his wild eyes on the road Takes me home Lights are off\, he's taking off his coat I say I heard that you been out and about with some other girl Some other girl He says\, what you've heard it's true but I Can't stop thinking about you and I I said I've been there too a few times  Take me home Just take me home Just take me home The Relica team is going on tour!

COL title VAL Vedrai vedrai COL performer VAL Luigi Tenco	COL video title VAL Take Me In Your Arms - Eddie Holland 1964 (Rare Original) COL channel name VAL Gilles Pilon COL description VAL Eddie Holland wasn't just a songwriter with Holland-Dozier-Holland\, the famous songwriting team for the Motown Label but was also for a short time a recording artist. It is Holland (and not Kim Weston in 1965) who did the first recording of "Take me in Your Arms (Rock Me a Little While)" in 1964 but it was not released commercially until 2005\, even though Weston's cover was the first commercial release. Listen and compare how Weston's cover is almost similar to Holland's original version here.   http://fr.youtube.com/watch?v=h4SEm44Ee8A&feature=related  The better known version that people most remember is the Doobie Brothers' cover in 1975 which went up to number 11 on the Billboard Charts that year. Enjoy this rare original recording. It just grooves dudes!!:))	0

A little bit of Jessica here I am\,  A little bit of you makes me your man!!!!!!!!  Mambo number five.  Verse 2   Jump up and down and move it all around.  Shake your head to the sound\, put your hands on the ground.  Take one step left and one step right.  One to the front and one to the side.  Clap your hands once and clap your hands twice  And if it look like this then you're doing it right.  Chorus   A little bit of Monica in my life\,  A little bit of Erica by my side.  A little bit of Rita's all I need\,  A little bit of Tina's all I see.  A little bit of Sandra in the sun\,  A little bit of Mary all night long.  A little bit of Jessica here I am\,  A little bit of you makes me your man!!!!!!!!  Bridge   Trumpet\, the trumpet.  Mambo number five\, ha\, ha\, ha.  Chorus   A little bit of Monica in my life\,  A little bit of Erica by my side.  A little bit of Rita's all I need\,  A little bit of Tina's all I see.  A little bit of Sandra in the sun\,  A little bit of Mary all night long.  A little bit of Jessica here I am\,  A little bit of you makes me your man!!!!!!!!  Outro   I do all to fall in love with a girl like you.  Cause you can't run and you can't hide.  You and me gonna touch the sky.  Mambo number five.	0

Stan Kelly  Lyrics: Oh you are a mucky kid\, Dirty as a dustbin lid. When he hears the things you did\, You'll gerra belt from your Dad. Oh you have your father's nose\, So crimson in the dark it glows\, If you're not asleep when the boozers close\, You'll gerra belt from your Dad.   You look so scruffy lying dur Strawberry-jam tats in yer 'air\, Though in the world you haven't a care And I have got so many. It's quite a struggle every day Living on your father's pay\, The bugger drinks it all away And leaves me without any.   Although we have no silver spoon\, Better days are coming soon Now Nelly's working at the Lune And she gets paid on Friday. Perhaps one day we'll have a splash\, When Littlewoods provide the cash\, We'll get a house in Knotty Ash And buy your Dad a brewery.   Oh you are a mucky kid\, Dirty as a dustbin lid. When he hears the things you did You'll gerra belt from your Dad. Oh you have your father's face\, You're growing up a real hard case\, But there's no one can take your place\, .... Go fast asleep for yer Mammy.	0

L√™ plays in the tradition of Hendrix without directly copying him\, being creative and stretching himself. The occasional vocals by drummer Terri Lyne Carrington\, A√Øda Khann\, and Corin Curschellas (which are sometimes spoken as much as sung) are unfortunately not as interesting and are mostly distracting. Bassist Michel Alibo is excellent during his solos and L√™ shows originality in his improvisations\, but the music overall is more heartfelt than essential\, particularly since Hendrix's own records are easily available.  Recorded at Studio Davout\, Studio Louxor\, Paris\, France and Systems Two\, New York\, New York between May & June 2002.  Personnel: Nguy√™n L√™ (guitar\, guitar synthesizer); Terri Lyne Carrington (vocals\, drums); Michel Alibo (electric bass).

At the dawn of the new millennium\, songwriter\, producer\, and multi- instrumentalist Klayton created Celldweller\, a ground-breaking aural entity for the next age. Thriving on originality\, Celldweller cross-bred electronic styles such as Drum'n'Bass and Psy-Trance with modern Alternative Rock and Metal on his self-titled debut\, released independently in 2003.  The Celldweller album met with critical acclaim while climbing to #17 on the Billboard Internet Sales Chart. Celldweller gained Top 40 Metal Radio charting with the track "I Believe You" pulling into a solid 11th place on the R&R Alternative Specialty Show Chart. Achieving a feat shared by only an elite handful of albums\, every song on Celldweller was eventually licensed for use in popular media. These songs were heard in movie trailers\, TV shows\, and games such as Spider Man 2\, Constantine\, Crackdown\, Need for Speed: Most Wanted\, Enter the Matrix\, CSI\, UFC\, The Shield\, and more.  Now\, Celldweller has been reissued to celebrate the tenth anniversary of its release with updated artwork and a second disc of remixes\, demos\, and previously unheard rarities (all remastered for this release). While Klayton busies himself in his Detroit studio preparing the future of Celldweller for 2013\, celebrate the past with this monumental work.  Want to use FiXT music in your YouTube videos?

Autry was also owner of a television station\, several radio stations in Southern California\, and the Los Angeles/California/Anaheim Angels Major League Baseball team from 1961 to 1997.  From 1934 to 1953\, Autry appeared in 93 films and 91 episodes of The Gene Autry Show television series. During the 1930s and 1940s\, he personified the straight-shooting hero‚Äîhonest\, brave\, and true‚Äîand profoundly touched the lives of millions of Americans. Autry was also one of the most important figures in the history of country music\, considered the second major influential artist of the genre's development after Jimmie Rodgers.[2] His singing cowboy movies were the first vehicle to carry country music to a national audience. ] In addition to his signature song\, "Back in the Saddle Again"\, Autry is still remembered for his Christmas holiday songs\, "Here Comes Santa Claus"\, which he wrote\, "Frosty the Snowman"\, and his biggest hit\, "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer".  Autry is a member of both the Country Music Hall of Fame and Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame\, and is the only person to be awarded stars in all five categories on the Hollywood Walk of Fame\, for film\, television\, music\, radio\, and live performance. The town of Gene Autry\, Oklahoma was named in his honor.	0

COL title VAL I Kissed a Girl COL performer VAL Attack Attack!	COL video title VAL Simon & Garfunkel - The Only Living Boy In New York COL channel name VAL kylecrazyford COL description VAL "The Only Living Boy in New York" is a song written by Paul Simon and performed by Simon and Garfunkel. It is the eighth track from the American pop duo's fifth and final studio album\, Bridge Over Troubled Water. The song was also issued as the B-Side to the duo's "Cecilia" single.  Simon wrote this as a thinly-veiled message to Art Garfunkel\, referring to a specific incident where Garfunkel went to Mexico to act in the film Catch-22. Simon was left alone in New York writing songs for Bridge over Troubled Water\, hence the lonely feelings of "The Only Living Boy In New York." Simon refers to Garfunkel in the song as Tom\, referring to their early days when they were called Tom and Jerry\, and encourages him to "let your honesty shine...like it shines on me". The background vocals feature both Garfunkel and Simon recorded together in an echo chamber\, multi-tracked around eight times.	0

I'll be lonely  But even though I'm lonely  There'll be no other guy.  Though I'll be gone for a while  I know that I'll be smiling  With my baby by and by and by  With my baby by and by.    I'll be gloomy  But send that rainbow to me  Then my shadows will fly Though you'll be gone for a while  I know that I'll be smiling  With my baby bye and bye   Bye bye baby  Remember you're my baby  When they give you the eye  Although I know that you care  Won't you write and declare  That though on the loose  You are still on the square   I'll be gloomy  But send that rainbow to me  Then my shadows will fly  Though you'll be gone for a while  I know that I'll be smiling  With my baby bye and bye  With my wonderful baby  By and by	0

COL title VAL Rien ne va plus COL performer VAL Zarah Leander	COL video title VAL BIG BAD JOHN ~ Jimmy Dean  (1961) COL channel name VAL MrRJDB1969 COL description VAL BIG BAD JOHN ~ Jimmy Dean  (1961) Columbia # CL 1735   Jimmy Dean - (August 10\, 1928 ‚Äì June 13\, 2010) Birth name: Jimmy Ray Dean  Birth place: Plainview\, Texas Place of death: Varina\, Virginia (at 81 years old)  Per the notes written on the back of the JIMMY DEAN: BIG BAD JOHN AND OTHER FABULOUS SONGS AND TALES (Columbia LP #CL 1735) record jacket\, it states:  "Jimmy Dean had been thinking for some time of writing a song about a PAUL BUNYAN-like hero.  He began writing the lyrics at home\, but never quite finished them\, because he had to fly to Nashville\, Tennessee for a recording session with veteran Columbia producer\, Don Law. Jimmy simply brought along the unfinished song. By the time he got off the plane\, he was virtually jumping with excitement. The song was completed and Don Law liked it so much\, that Big Bad John was recorded immediately" - (Side note: There's a little touch of "Sixteen Tons" by Tennessee Ernie Ford here as well) -  Note: What many today call\, "rapping" was originally\, in a cleaner form\, referred to as\,  "calling". Talking in rhyming sentences or speaking the lyrics instead of singing them\, which was very common in Country & Western music. It began with the square dance "caller" who gave direction to the dancers\, through rhyming sentences set to the cadence or beat of the music being played by a live band. He never sang\, he just spoke the words in rhyme. Much the same as a auction house auctioneer\, who speaks the bids in a fast rhythm\, choosing words which often rhyme.  The "caller" and the dance can be:  "traced back through England  to the old French cotillions" (17th century) (per Lloyd Shaw-1939). Also\, a form of "calling" or "auction house crying" can be found in the 1947 recording of\, "Smoke\, Smoke\, Smoke (That Cigarette) (Tex Williams & Phil Harris) or "The Darktown Poker Club" (1946) (Phil Harris) for example\, and many other older recordings. Therefore\, "rap" isn't new\, it's just a continuation of something which started many years earlier. (* No one has ever said this\,  but I believe\, "Cajun Doll"\, by Lattie Moore\,  may have inspired the writing of both "Big Bad John" and "The Cajun Queen". )	0

COL title VAL Brain Damage COL performer VAL Neville Skelly	COL video title VAL 'Something in the Air' - new version by The Luck of Eden Hall (originally by Thunderclap Newman) COL channel name VAL FruitsdeMer2 COL description VAL 'Something In The Air' pretty much sums up UK pop psych in the sixties for me  - Speedy Kean wrote it\, Thunderclap Newman gave up his post round to play on it\, Pete Townsend produced it (and maybe played bass on it).

The album was recorded through the hurricanes Gustav\, Hannah and Ike. Sometimes there wasn't enough power for the lights so they had to record by candle light which certainly added to the atmosphere!

"El Chispa" Cervantes  (Bass); Rayhner Lasserie (Timbale); Luis Amaurys Leyva Suarez (Tres); Yanko Pizaco & Alexander Valdes Sarduy (Trumpet:);Yamil Rivero Cardenas &  Joel Sago Bell (Trombone) and backing vocals from Danaily Hernandes Del Valle\, Rayhner Lasserie\, Lazaro Antonio Rodriguez\, Tasita D'Mour and Claudio Passavanti himself.

COL title VAL Ain't That a Lot of Love COL performer VAL Sam & Dave	COL video title VAL Kay Starr - My Heart Reminds Me (1957) COL channel name VAL CatsPjamas1 COL description VAL Charted at #9 on Billboard Hot 100 in September 1957. Incredible orchestra and arrangement! Adapted from "Autumn Concerto" and also known as "And That Reminds Me". Kay's last Top 10 hit\, and her last Billboard charting single until "Foolin' Around" got to #49 in March 1961. This song also charted at #12 on the Hot 100 for Della Reese in August 1957\, #31 Adult Contemporary for Vikki Carr in 1966 and #45 on the Hot 100 for the Four Seasons in September 1969.   Original Billboard review: "Here's a sock performance by Kay Starr on a powerful dramatic ballad\, based on "Autumn Concerto". Lush\, big band backing is in keeping with sweeping effect of platter. Should pull plenty of jockey spins\, and could put gal back on charts."  Written by Camillo Bargoni\, Al Stillman & Paul Siegel.   B-side is "Flim Flam Flou".	0

COL title VAL I Can't Go for That COL performer VAL The Bird and the Bee	COL video title VAL Jessica Williams - Green Chimneys (T.Monk) COL channel name VAL Andr√© Rodrigues Pereira da Silva COL description VAL Review from allmusic:  ¬´Recorded at a special afternoon series sponsored by Chemekata College in Oregon\, Jazz in the Afternoon is a trio date\, with Williams joined by Dave Captein on bass and Mel Brown on drums. The recording is surprisingly dense however\, with Williams spraying notes all over on her solo for the Monk tune "Green Chimneys" which opens the set. Captein and Brown both sound enthused by the sprightly playing and keep up the pace admirably. Williams changes directions often\, moving with a smooth grace from the stately "Light Blue" (another Monk piece) to a barreling "Straight\, No Chaser" (ditto\, obviously) to Gershwin's playful "Swanee." Her playing never falters throughout the 70-minute recording. Though Williams recorded several excellent live albums\, Jazz in the Afternoon is another great addition to her discography. ¬ª	0

Mae'r term 'hen ferchetan' yn golygu dynes sydd heb briodi. Traditional Welsh folk song. The term 'hen ferchetan' means a woman who has never married.  The translation 'old maid' doesn't mean that the maid in question is actually old of age :-)  Geiriau: Hen ferchetan wedi colli'i chariad\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. Cael un arall\, dyna oedd ei bwriad\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Ond nid oedd un o lancie'r pentre\, ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, am briodi Lisa fach yr Hendre\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Hen ferchetan sydd yn dal i drio\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. Gwisgo lase sidan ac ymbincio\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Ond os oes br√¢n i fr√¢n yn rhywle\, ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, nid oes neb i Lisa fach yr Hendre\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Hen ferchetan bron √¢ thorri'i chalon\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. Mynd i'r llan mae pawb o'r hen gariadon\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.

Hen ferchetan aeth i Ffair y Bala\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. Gweld Si√¥n Prys yn fachgen digon smala\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Gair a ddywedodd wrth fynd adre'\, ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, gododd calon Lisa fach yr Hendre\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.

To get another\, that was her intention\,  ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  But none of the village boys\,  ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, wanted to marry Lisa fach yr Hendre\,  ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  An old maid keeps on trying\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. Wore satin lace and make up\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  But if there's someone for everyone somewhere\, ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, there is no one for Lisa fach yr Hendre\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  The old maid's heart is almost broken\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. All of her old lovers have married\,  ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  There'll be new potatoes on apple trees\, ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, before Lisa fach yr Hendre will marry\,  ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  The old maid went to Fair in Bala\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. Saw Si√¥n Prys an attractive lad\,  ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  A word he spoke as he went home\, ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, lifted Lisa fach yr Hendre's heavy heart \, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.
