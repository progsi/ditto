COL title VAL Turn Your Radio On COL performer VAL Lulu Belle & Scotty and Five String Banjo	COL video title VAL Diane Ray - No Arms Can Ever Hold You (1964) COL channel name VAL Tom Smith COL description VAL One of the most adorable records ever\, and one of my favourite songs. Released on a single in March 1964. The other side\, "Tied Up With Mary" charted locally\, but not nationally. Diane's only nationally charting Billboard single was "Please Don't Talk to the Lifeguard" (#31 in September 1963). "No Arms Can Ever Hold You" was originally a hit in 1955\, charting at #23 Billboard Pop for Georgie Shaw\, #26 for Pat Boone and #67 for the Gaylords\, all around the same time. Later\, this song charted at #27 for the Bachelors on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1965 (#7 UK\, #3 Adult Contemporary) and #93 on the Hot 100 for Bobby Vinton in 1970 (#8 Adult Contemporary).  Arranged by Bill Justis.  Written by Art Crafer and Jimmy Nebb.	0

ALSO if like so many people think Pink Floyd is "untouchable" why do you have such high expectations of the song\, also a cover version is your own version\, if they did exactly the same thing people would just bitch about that too - So...  Shut Up - watch the video if you like it\, if u don't please leave constructive critism - instead of "this sux :("  Thank You :)  Lyrics  Come in here\, dear boy\, have a cigar. youre gonna go far\, fly high\, Youre never gonna die\, youre gonna make it if you try;theyre gonna love you. Well Ive always had a deep respect\, and I mean that most sincerely. The band is just fantastic\, that is really what I think. oh by the way\, Which ones pink?  And did we tell you the name of the game\, boy\, we call it riding the Gravy train.

Now you play a real good guitar boy\, but give the devil his due\, I'll bet a guitar of gold against you soul 'cause i think i'm better then you.  The boy said my name's Johnny\, it might be a sin\, i'll take your bet You're gonna regret\, I'm the best I've ever been.  Johnny rosen up your pick an' play your guitar hard 'cause hell's broke loose in scunthorpe an' the devil deals the cards. Now if you win you'll get this shinny guitar made of gold\, but if you loose the devil gets your soul!  The devil opened up his case and said 'i'll start this gig' and fire flew from his finger tips as he rosened up his pick. He strummed the pick across the strings it made an evil hiss Then a band of demons joined in and it sounded somthing like this  When the devil finished Johnny said 'You're pretty good ol' son\, but sit down in that chair right there let me show you how it's done!'  Fire on the mountain run boy's run! Devil's in the house of the risen sun! Chicken in the bread pan picken out dough! Granny does your dog bite\, no child\, no!   The devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat\, and he laid that golden gitar on the ground at Johnny's feet. Johnny said 'devil just come on back if you ever want to try again\, I done told you once you son of a bitch i'm the best I've ever been!'  Fire on the mountain run boy's run! Devil's in the house of the risen sun! Chicken in the bread pan picken out dough! Granny does your dog bite\, no child\, no!	1

COL title VAL Lady in Black COL performer VAL Uriah Heep	COL video title VAL You're A Grand Old Flag - Billy Murray and The American Quartet (Victor)1917 COL channel name VAL althazarr's good time oldies COL description VAL Recorded June 4\, 1917.  "You're a Grand Old Flag" is a patriotic song of the United States. The song\, a spirited march written by George M. Cohan\, is a tribute to the U.S. flag. In addition to obvious references to the flag\, it incorporates snippets of other popular songs\, including one of his own. Cohan wrote it in 1906 for George Washington\, Jr.\, his stage musical.  The song was first publicly performed on February 6\, the play's opening night\, at Herald Square Theater in New York City. "You're a Grand Old Flag" quickly became the first song from a musical to sell over a million copies of sheet music. The title and first lyric comes from someone Cohan once met; the Library of Congress website notes:  The original lyric for this perennial George M. Cohan favorite came\, as Cohan later explained\, from an encounter he had with a Civil War veteran who fought at Gettysburg. The two men found themselves next to each other and Cohan noticed the vet held a carefully folded but ragged old flag. The man reportedly then turned to Cohan and said\, "She's a grand old rag." Cohan thought it was a great line and originally named his tune "You're a Grand Old Rag." So many groups and individuals objected to calling the flag a "rag\," however\, that he "gave 'em what they wanted" and switched words\, renaming the song "You're a Grand Old Flag." — Library of Congress	0

COL title VAL Break on Through COL performer VAL Night Shift	COL video title VAL Bert Kaempfert - The Way It Used To Be COL channel name VAL Socratess2007 COL description VAL Bert Kaempfert knew exactly which 'hitparade' songs could be 'transformed' into a "Kaempfert classic".  When Engelbert Humperdinck scored a major hit with "The Way it used to Be" in 1968\, Bert heard right away that this magnificent melody had all the elements it took for a 'new' Kaempfert track.  Bert obviously wrote a new orchestral arrangement\, where after a "new easy listening classic" was born :)  The album "Traces Of Love" - from which the track is taken - breathes quality from beginning to end.   Here we can listen to a Bert Kaempfert 'at his best' - bringing his tunes with an even larger orchestra and with audio technicians (eg Peter Klemt) behind the controls who make use of the newest recording technology available (at the time\, ie in 1969). If ever the term "heavenly music" could be used\, it sure is here.  Bert Kaempfert created music\, that\, without any doubt\, will please audiences for generations to come. From the 1969 album "Traces Of Love" here is "Mister Hitmaker" once again bringing you "The Way It Used To Be".  Enjoy.	0

COL title VAL Just Your Fool COL performer VAL Little Walter	COL video title VAL Maddox Brothers & Rose - No Help Wanted COL channel name VAL HillbillyBoogie1 COL description VAL The Maddox Brothers and Rose\, known as America's Most Colorful Hillbilly Band from the 1930s to the 1950s\, consisted of four brothers\, Fred\, Cal\, Cliff and Don Maddox\, along with their sister Rose. Cliff died in 1949 and was replaced by brother Henry. The group disbanded in 1956.  The family hailed from Boaz\, Alabama\, but rode the rails and hitch hiked to California in 1933 when the band members were still children\, following the failed efforts of their sharecropper parents during the early part of the Depression. They were a little in advance of the flood of Okies who were to flood the state in the 30s. They struggled to make a living as intinerant fruit and vegetable pickers following the harvest as far north as Washington state\, and as far east as Arizona\, as well as in the San Joaquin Valley. They often worked from dawn to dusk\, sleeping and eating on the ground.  Having settled in Modesto\, the family developed their musical ability and\, in 1937 performed on the radio\, sponsored by a local furniture store. In 1939 they entered a hillbilly band competition at the centenial Sacramento State Fair after driving to Sacramento in their Model A. When they took the stage they tore through "Sally Let Your Bangs Hang Down" with rocking rhythms and risque lyrics. They became\, officially\, California's best hillbilly band.  The brothers and Rose appeared at places such as the 97th Street Corral in Los Angles.  From 1946-1951 the group recorded for 4 Star Records (Hollywood)\, then for Columbia Records. Some 4 Star masters were leased and released by US.-Decca Records at the beginning of the 1950s. The following quotes are from Rose Maddox. "We were called hillbilly singers - not country - then. No\, none of this country music then. People just called us hillbilly... People tell me that I was one of the first women to sing what I sang - country boogie. I guess I was. There was no rock 'n' roll in those early days\, before 1955. Only country boogie. My brothers also played that way. We called it country then.  The Maddox's material ranged from the country standards of Hank Williams and Merle Travis\, cowboy songs\, to the Western swing of Bob Wills\, to old-time\, folk\, and church singing\, to jazz\, swing\, boogie woogie and even a taste of early rock and roll.  Fred Maddox played upright bass using the "slap bass" technique as early as 1937.[5] This trademark backbeat\, a slapping bass style\, helped drive a broad change in popular music\, sporting a faster\, immediately discernible rhythm that came to be known as rockabilly.  Fred Maddox's bass is displayed at the Experience Music Project in Seattle. "They wanted his bass because they believe he might have hit the first note of rock 'n' roll on it.	0

COL title VAL Beautiful Delilah COL performer VAL Chuck Berry	COL video title VAL Maynard Ferguson - Chameleon COL channel name VAL malawolf85 COL description VAL Walter Maynard Ferguson\, best know for his extreme high register control on trumpet\, was a Canadian jazz trumpet player and bandleader. Born in Verdun\, Quebec (now part of Montreal) Maynard by the age of four was playing piano and violin but at 9 years of age he switched to cornet. At age thirteen\, Maynard first soloed as a child prodigy with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Orchestra and was heard frequently on the CBC\, notably featured on a "Serenade for Trumpet in Jazz" written for him by Morris Davis. Maynard won a scholarship to the French Conservatory of Music where he studied from 1943 through 1948 with Bernard Baker. Maynard dropped out of Montreal High School at age 15 to more actively pursue a music career\, performing in dance bands led by Stan Wood\, Roland David\, and Johnny Holmes. During this period\, Maynard came to the attention of numerous American bandleaders and began receiving offers to come to the United States. Maynard moved to the United States in 1949 and initially played with the bands of Boyd Raeburn\, Jimmy Dorsey\, and Charlie Barnet. The Barnet band was notable for a trumpet section that also included Doc Severinsen\, Ray Wetzel\, Johnny Howell\, and Rolf Erickson. When Barnet temporarily retired in 1949 and disbanded his orchestra\, Maynard was free to accept an offer to join Stan Kenton's newly formed Innovations Orchestra\, a 40-piece jazz concert orchestra with strings. While the Innovations Orchestra was not commercially successful\, it made a number of remarkable recordings\, including "Maynard Ferguson\," one of a series of pieces named after featured soloists. When Kenton returned to a more practical 19-piece jazz band\, Maynard continued with him. So popular was Maynard with Kenton that for three years running\, 1950\, 1951\, and 1952\, he won the Down Beat Readers' Poll as best trumpeter. In 1953\, Maynard left Kenton to become a first-call session player for Paramount Pictures. Ferguson appeared on 46 soundtracks including The Ten Commandments. Ferguson still recorded jazz during this period\, but his Paramount contract prevented him from playing jazz clubs. While he enjoyed the regular paycheck\, Ferguson was very unhappy with the lack of live performance opportunities and left Paramount in 1956. In 1956\, Maynard was tapped to lead the Birdland Dream Band\, a 14-piece big band formed by Morris Levy as an "all-star" lineup to play at Levy's Birdland jazz club in New York City. While the name "Birdland Dream Band" was short-lived and is represented by only two albums\, this band became the core of Maynard's performing band for the next nine years. Following the path taken by many jazz artists in the 1960s\, Ferguson left the United States. Feeling that he needed a period of spiritual exploration. Maynard formed a new band and it made its North American debut in 1971. Maynard latched on to the burgeoning jazz education movement by recruiting talented musicians from colleges with jazz programs and targeting young audiences with performances and master classes in high schools. This practical and strategic move helped him develop a strong following that would sustain him for the remainder of his career. In 1988\, Maynard formed the group Big Bop Nouveau\, a nine-piece band featuring three trumpets\, one trombone\, two reeds and a three-piece rhythm section. The band's repertoire included original jazz compositions and modern arrangements of jazz standards\, with occasional pieces from his '70s book and the Birdland Dream Band; this format proved to be successful with audiences and critics. In 1992\, he was inducted into the Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame. Just days after completing a weeklong run at New York's Blue Note and recording a studio album in New Jersey\, Maynard developed an abdominal infection that resulted in kidney and liver failure. Ferguson died on the evening of August 23\, 2006 at the Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura\, California.	0

COL title VAL A Little Respect COL performer VAL Erasure	COL video title VAL Kim Wilde - A Little Respect COL channel name VAL José Teixeira COL description VAL #kimwilde - A Little Respect  Song written and originally recorded by Erasure.  Erasure version The British synthpop duo Erasure released 'A Little Respect' in September 1988 as their tenth single. The single was taken from their album 'The Innocents'. The lyric is an empowering plea to a lover to show compassion and respect.  Kim Wilde version Kim Wilde performed this song live during her European tour in March/April 2009 and subsequent festival performances in the summer of 2009. She continued to perform the song in 2010 and during the 'Come Out and Play' tour in March 2011. In August 2011 the song was released as a studio recording on Kim's album Snapshots.  Kim about 'A little respect' 'A Little Respect' is a great song by Erasure\, Vince Clark and Andy Bell\, and I remember it came out in 1988 which was a really important year for me. I had 'Close' out which did really well\, and of course I was on tour with Michael Jackson\, so it all kindof kicked off that year. Every time I hear this song it just takes me back to that fantastic time in my career.

COL title VAL We've Got a Good Thing Going COL performer VAL Fiona	COL video title VAL Cliff Richard - We Don't Talk Anymore (1979) COL channel name VAL Ichnos71live COL description VAL Britain's answer to Elvis Presley\, Richard (born Harry Webb) dominated the pre-Beatles British pop scene in the late '50s and early '60s. An accomplished singer with a genuine feel for the music\, Richard's artistic legacy is nonetheless meager\, as he was quickly steered toward a middle-of-the-road pop direction. Several of his late-'50s recordings\, however\, were genuinely exciting Presley-esque rockers -- especially his first hit\, "Move It" (1958) -- and gave British teenagers their first taste of genuine homegrown rock & roll talent. Backed by the Shadows -- clean-cut instrumental virtuosos who became legends of their own -- Richard embarked on a truly awesome string of hit singles in Britain\, scoring no less than 43 Top 20 hits between 1958 and 1969. One of these\, although it was by no means one of the more successful\, was an actual Mick Jagger/Keith Richards composition (the ballad "Blue Turns to Grey").  In his homeland\, Richard's popularity was diminished only slightly by the rise of the Beatles\, but in his prime\, he had a much rougher time in the U.S.\, hitting the Top 40 only three times (with "Living Doll" in 1959\, "It's All in the Game" in 1963\, and "Devil Woman" in 1976). Richard belatedly cracked the U.S. Top Ten in 1976 with "Devil Woman\," and racked up a few other hits ("We Don't Talk Anymore\," "Dreaming\," "A Little in Love") in a mainstream pop/rock style. He remains an institution in Britain\, where he is one of the nation's most popular all-around entertainers of all time. ~ Richie Unterberger\, All Music Guide _____________________________________ In 2008\, Richard's 50th year in music\, will see the release of the 8CD box set\, And They Said It Wouldn't Last (My 50 Years In Music). In September\, a single celebrating his 50 years in pop music\, titled * Thank you for a Lifetime has been released. On the 14th of September 2008 Thank You For A Lifetime reached No.3 on the UK music charts\, which gives Cliff a Top 3 hit in each of his six decades as a singer. On 2nd November 2008\, British newspaper The Mail on Sunday gave away a free promotional CD entitled '50th Anniversary' containing 12 tracks picked by Sir Cliff himself.	0

The track was a no. 1 hit in the UK Singles Chart for three weeks in May 1979\, but despite this was not released as a single in the United States.  Song information  The song was written by Chris Stein and was the fourth single to be taken from the album\, Parallel Lines\, in the UK and most other parts of the world. The single had an unusual release in Australia\, with some dispute among fans as to whether it reached no. 1 there or failed to chart. This is because of its initial release as the lead single from Parallel Lines\, due to its being reminiscent of "In The Flesh"\, Blondie's first hit in Australia. "Sunday Girl" failed to chart\, however\, and was later re-released as a double A-side with "Heart of Glass"\, on the back of its UK success. As a result\, it was eclipsed by the disco track\, and is rarely recognised as having charted in its own right.  A French-language version of the track was released in the UK on the "Sunday Girl" 12" single; in France and the Netherlands\, it was the B-side of the 7". It also appears on the cassette release of Eat to the Beat. For Blondie's first greatest hits album The Best of Blondie in 1981\, producer Mike Chapman created a special mix which incorporated one verse sung in French. The bilingual version appears on the 2002 compilation Greatest Hits.  In 2010 a remake of this song was made by the English performer Florrie. It had slightly different lyrics and was used for a Nina Ricci perfume commercial. The song was covered in 2013 by the band She & Him on the album Volume 3.  In 2013 Blondie themselves re-recorded the song and offered it to be included in the CBGB's film soundtrack. This version was included on their 2014 compilation album Greatest Hits Deluxe Redux. The compilation was part of a 2-disc set called Blondie 4(0) Ever which included their 10th studio album Ghosts of Download and marked the 40th anniversary of the forming of the band.

The song has also appeared on Zappa's Fillmore East - June 1971 and You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore\, Vol. 4 albums.  The album title Hot Rats comes from a lyric of Willie the Pimp. The origin of the song was explained in a conversation Zappa recorded in 1972. This interview recording was later released as "The Story of Willie the Pimp" on the Zappa album Mystery Disc.  The song was ranked number 75 on the list of "The 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time" of Rolling Stone.

We recorded it analogue to tape in the wonderful AGM studio. So nice to work with Christoffer there it was two wonderful days. Thanks Hannes\, Charlie\, Lefvande Bilder and Christoffer for all this! / Wintergatan  About the occasion: The Swedish charity magazine Faktum asked several artists to record a song each for the compilation album "Det ordnar sig" meaning "it will be OK" in english. Wintergatan was asked to record Visa Från Utanmyra\, a swedish folksong made famous by late swedish piano player Jan Johansson. Don´t miss out on listening to his wonderful version of the song\, we wanted to capture that same feeling without doing it in the exact same way. The album is being sold by Faktum street sellers in Gothenburg and Malmö.  If you want to support what we do:  If you want to support: The fact that you are watching the videos and care about the music and future of Wintergatan is the best support anyone can have\, I want to thank everyone who is here for that kind of support\, it is really the fuel for the Wintergatan Engine.  Why do we accept support in this way? I\, Martin\, can already sustain myself 100% doing what I love to do. If you want to support artists/organisations who have not yet reached that privileged position\, please consider supporting other artists/organisations who need the support more. With that said\, I have too many ideas and too little time and with your support I can get more help from people around me to execute the ideas better and bring them out in the world faster.

I am going through the whole collection and putting all of them online.  I started this channel because posting all of this music on my main mining and carpentry channel was driving subscribers away.  Some of the stuff is kind of rare and a bunch of it will be the only copy on youtube.  In theory all of these records are for sale if you want them.  Message me in the comments.   All of the records are being played on Zenith 6R-668 tube type radio and record player.  When I picked it up from the leftovers pile at the estate it was not working.  While not a record player expert by any means\, I was able to get it operable.  The needle is rough but after carefully reshaping it on a diamond stone I got it to play much better.  So far no replacement needle can be located.  I found one that fit the holder but it was the newer style and didn't work with 78's.  You can get a look at the player by following this link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YCtwrOdGb8 We have no intention of fighting any content challenges; even the bogus ones and so will simply acknowledge and move on.  My only goal is to put it out there before it is gone.  In theory any of these records is for sale and you need but drop me a line in the comments.  I do intend to monetize but understand we are talking a predicted whole channel income of less than $5 a month.  Anything helps and this take a lot of times so please don't hate me for that. --Ken	0

Recorded in the early 1960s\, "Funnel of Love" was released as the B-side to Jackson's major country-pop single\, "Right or Wrong". Although the song never became a hit independently from the A-side\, it has received notable critical acclaim and attention. The song's unique combination of country\, rock\, and blues have made it a favorite of fans and critics. Many also consider "Funnel of Love" to be one of Jackson's best vocal performances.  Background  Charlie McCoy\, a country musician\, and Kent Westbury\, a country songwriter\, wrote the lyrics and melody to "Funnel of Love". The song came to the attention of Jackson while recording for Capitol Records in the early 1960s\, under the direction of producer Ken Nelson. Up to this point\, Jackson had been known as a country performer and more significantly as a rock and roll performer. She had previously enjoyed both country and rock hits\, including "You Can't Have My Love" (1954) and "Let's Have a Party" (1960). In an interview with Philadelphia Weekly\, Jackson recounted that it was difficult identifying "Funnel of Love" with a specific musical genre\, stating that its style was not like that of a typical country or rock recording: "It wasn't country\, it wasn't rock\, but we knew it was a good song. So we made a good record on it."  Regardless\, the song was well-received by both Jackson and Ken Nelson\, leading to the song's initial recording. "Funnel of Love" was recorded at the Bradley Film and Recording Studio in Nashville\, Tennessee\, United States on October 28\, 1960. The session was Jackson's third recording session in Nashville. Jackson and Nelson had been recording material in Hollywood\, California since the early 1950s. Also cut at the session was the eventual A-side to "Funnel of Love" entitled "Right or Wrong"\, as well as "Riot in Cell Black #9" and "Little Charm Bracelet". The latter was the precessing single to "Right or Wrong". Included in the recording session was The Nashville A-Team of musicians\, which appeared on most country recording sessions in the late 1950s and 1960s. The song's guitar solo is performed by Roy Clark\, who was a member of Jackson's band "The Party Timers" and would later have a successful country music career.  Release and reception  "Funnel of Love" was released as B-side of the "Right or Wrong" single in April 1961. The songs were released on Capitol Records. The A-side became Wanda Jackson's second top-ten hit on the Billboard Hot Country and Western Sides chart\, peaking at number nine. It also became her second top-forty single on the Billboard Hot 100\, reaching number twenty nine. "Funnel of Love" however\, failed to chart any Billboard lists.  "Funnel of Love" was never released via an album during Jackson's time at Capitol Records. The song went unreleased on an album until Bear Family Records released the Wanda Jackson box set Right or Wrong in 1992. "Funnel of Love" was then released onto various compilations during the 1990s and 2000s. The song has since received vast critical acclaim from multiple music critics. Adam Gold of Rolling Stone called Jackson's song a "greasy classic" and Tim Sendra of Allmusic explained that although "Funnel of Love" is not associated with the "girl group" sound of the sixties\, it "adds historical interest" and is "really quite good too". Chris Parker of Philadelphia Weekly stated that "Funnel of Love" was one of his favorite songs by Wanda Jackson.  With the renewal of interest in Jackson's career since the 1990s\, "Funnel of Love" has become a favorite of Wanda Jackson fans. Many were surprised that the B-side did not become more successful. It has since been covered by various musical artists. In 2001\, foreign music group Velvetone released a single version of "Funnel of Love"\, featuring Jackson herself. Jackson revisited "Funnel of Love" on her 2003 studio album\, Heart Trouble. The new version featured the punk rock band The Cramps as guest performers.  "Funnel of Love" has also served as an inspiration for new musical artists\, most notably British soul artist Adele.  The song is used at the opeing scene of the 2013 Jim Jarmusch's film ''Only Lovers Left Alive''. It is also included in the soundtrack of the movie.	0

The three siblings -- now aged 15\,18 and 17 - first came together onstage at a country and rockabilly jam in a North London pub. Over five years later the 50s music\, fashion and technology obsessed family have built a massive word of mouth audience through a stream of rapturously received gigs and festival appearances and are ready to release their first long player on Rob da Bank's Sunday Best label on 28th July 2008.  The single 'Going Up The Country' is a perfectly rounded summer holiday feel-good jam\, full of harmonica solos\, handclaps and lyrics about leaving the city smog for fairer country hills. Coming out on 7"\, authentic 78rpm 10"\, CD and download on 7th July 2008.

As to vocal talent and song interpretation\, he had it nailed down\, even covering stuff that wasn't country by any stretch. Anyhow\, a dose of Nat is a good way to end the week\, so enjoy!

COL title VAL Märk hur vår skugga COL performer VAL Mediæval Bæbes	COL video title VAL Simon & Garfunkel - The Only Living Boy In New York COL channel name VAL kylecrazyford COL description VAL "The Only Living Boy in New York" is a song written by Paul Simon and performed by Simon and Garfunkel. It is the eighth track from the American pop duo's fifth and final studio album\, Bridge Over Troubled Water. The song was also issued as the B-Side to the duo's "Cecilia" single.  Simon wrote this as a thinly-veiled message to Art Garfunkel\, referring to a specific incident where Garfunkel went to Mexico to act in the film Catch-22. Simon was left alone in New York writing songs for Bridge over Troubled Water\, hence the lonely feelings of "The Only Living Boy In New York." Simon refers to Garfunkel in the song as Tom\, referring to their early days when they were called Tom and Jerry\, and encourages him to "let your honesty shine...like it shines on me". The background vocals feature both Garfunkel and Simon recorded together in an echo chamber\, multi-tracked around eight times.	0

COL title VAL Love Hangover COL performer VAL Teresa Carpio	COL video title VAL YVONNE ELLIMAN Hello Stranger COL channel name VAL daveinprogress3 COL description VAL Hawaiian beauty\, Yvonne Elliman\, was not on the pop landscape all that long\, but she made her impact\, and her gorgeous face and sweet but powerful vocals graced the 1970's with a distinctive air. I am posting "Hello Stranger"\, as it is not one of her bigger chart successes\, but it does showcase her wonderful voice and it is a very seventies take on the 60's Barbara Lewis classic.  35 years ago\, "Love me"\, written by the Bee Gees\, was a breakout hit for Yvonne\, giving her a worldwide hit\, including Australia\, where it would ascend the charts and reach #4 in the late summer of 1977. "Hello Stranger" was discovered by me\, once again courtesy of a Various Artist compile - the sexy styled "Ripper 77" with the curvaceous cheeks of a woman adorned with lipstick writing of the names of the 20 original artists featured on the record.  "Hello Stranger"\, like several of the hits on this compile\, was not a hit in Australia\, but three and a half decades later\, it is a fondly considered musical postcard from the era\, and i am eternally grateful to the record companies for releasing those compilations\, even if some of the inclusions were bizarre and obscure.  Back in the halcyon days of the late 1970's\, radio airplay and tv shows like "Countdown" and "Sounds Unlimited" were the few outlets for songs to receive exposure. So many fine recordings were simply overlooked\, because of the few opportunities for visibility or audibility at the time.   1978 would be the major year for Yvonne with another Gibb brothers extravaganza giving her the biggest success of her career with the #1 smash "If I can't have you"\, from  the pop & disco juggernaut "Saturday Night Fever". Another movie soundtrack "Moment by Moment" also starring John Travolta\, would see another recording by Yvonne Elliman - the title track\, but the gentle ballad could not break through the endless litany of disco hits that monopolised 1979. Her own "Love Pains" was her final hit from that part of her career\, and it is a much loved and much covered anthem from the disco era.  I hope "Hello Stranger" gives whoever hears it\, the joy that it has given me.	0

She later left the band and embarked on a solo career. Her first album Sundown Lady in 1972 arranged by Herb Alpert is a sublime combination of folk and funk marrying Hall's intimate soulful vocals  with breezy guitar and a thick percolating bassline.

COL title VAL The Only Living Boy in New York COL performer VAL The Farewell Drifters	COL video title VAL Simon & Garfunkel - The Only Living Boy In New York COL channel name VAL kylecrazyford COL description VAL "The Only Living Boy in New York" is a song written by Paul Simon and performed by Simon and Garfunkel. It is the eighth track from the American pop duo's fifth and final studio album\, Bridge Over Troubled Water. The song was also issued as the B-Side to the duo's "Cecilia" single.  Simon wrote this as a thinly-veiled message to Art Garfunkel\, referring to a specific incident where Garfunkel went to Mexico to act in the film Catch-22. Simon was left alone in New York writing songs for Bridge over Troubled Water\, hence the lonely feelings of "The Only Living Boy In New York." Simon refers to Garfunkel in the song as Tom\, referring to their early days when they were called Tom and Jerry\, and encourages him to "let your honesty shine...like it shines on me". The background vocals feature both Garfunkel and Simon recorded together in an echo chamber\, multi-tracked around eight times.	1
COL title VAL Let's Hang On! COL performer VAL The 4 Seasons featuring The "Sound" of Frankie Valli	COL video title VAL Betty Johnson -- I Need You Now (VintageMusic.es) COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Betty Johnson 16 de marzo 1929 (otras fuentes dicen 1931)  es una cantante norteamericana que alcanzó su pico de carrera en la década de 1950. Cuando era adolescente\, fue contratada por Columbia Records e hizo algunas grabaciones\, ninguna de las cuales tuvieron éxito. En 1951\, Percy Faith \, que la había conocido por sus grabaciones de Columbia\, trató de convencer a Mitch Miller ( A & R\, el director de Columbia) para firmar con ella\, pero Miller\, que incluye Doris Day y Rosemary Clooney \, entre los artistas que habían firmado\, no veía la necesidad firmar con ella.  Johnson lanzó el álbum para niños\, con Eddy Arnold producido por Simon and Schuster \, que posteriormente la contrató para su propio sello discográfico\, Bell Records en 1954. En el mismo año firmó un contrato con Csida-Grean\, una sociedad de gestión que había manejado la carrera de Arnold. Charles Grean\, miembro  de esa compañía\,  produjo muchas de sus grabaciones posteriores. En 1955\, firmó un contrato con RCA Victor Records \, que la envió a Chicago\, Illinois .  En Chicago\, Johnson trabajó con Arnold de nuevo en su  serie\, Eddy Arnold Time\, respaldado por un grupo que había trabajado con su familia en el Grand Ole Opry\, The Jordanaires . Este grupo más tarde fue conocido como un grupo de apoyo de Elvis Presley .  En 1957 se casó con Grean\, aunque el matrimonio sólo duraría hasta 1961\, la relación profesional continuó. Luego fue contratada por Jack Paar para su programa de televisión\, Tonight . Esto condujo a un contrato discográfico con Atlantic Records en 1957\, para el que tuvo su próximo gran éxito\, "Little Blue Man".  Johnson continuó en Tonight hasta 1962 cuando Jack Paar fue reemplazado por Johnny Carson.

Rob Ivey (Batching It)  http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#!/pages/Batching-It/141041665946741 http://www.myspace.com/batchingit09 http://www.twitter.com/batching_it  From Batching It's debut album "Homage".  The Unforgiven as originally performed by Metallica.  Batching It is a one-man punk-rock cover band featuring Rob Ivey\, a San Francisco East Bay musician. Hailing from Vallejo\, CA\, Rob was previously in Vallejo bands Bottomdawg and The V-Town Have-Nots \, and also played drums in Diabolical Exploits with veteran punk-rock producer Andy Ernst\, who has produced such notable bands as Green Day\, Rancid\, and AFI.  The name 'Batching It' is short for 'batcheloring it'\, or 'going it alone'\, which perfectly describes the philosophy behind the project. After many years of not being in a band\, Rob's nostalgia kicked in and he decided that it was time to make a cover album of influential bands/songs\, songs and bands that inspired him to become a musician in his teenage years. The first Batching It project\, due out in the Fall of 2009 on Leficit Records\, is called 'Homage' - a self-explanatory title. Rob wanted to pay tribute to these bands and songs by reintroducing them to the new generation\, and covered in Rob's personal favorite styles.  Recorded at the legendary Art of Ears studio in Hayward\, CA by Andy Ernst\, and produced by Mike Lawson of Leficit Records\, 'Homage' is a 15-track nod to\, in Rob's opinion\, 15 awesome bands: NOFX\, Skankin' Pickle\, Swingin' Utters\, Pearl Jam\, Rancid\, Lagwagon\, Metallica\, Sublime\, No Use For a Name\, Smashing Pumpkins\, Weezer\, No Doubt\, The Descendents\, Less Than Jake\, and Operation Ivy. Crossing rock genres\, just like Rob's personal tastes\, 'Homage' should have something for everyone.	1

It is the eighth track from the American pop duo's fifth and final studio album\, Bridge Over Troubled Water. The song was also issued as the B-Side to the duo's "Cecilia" single.  Simon wrote this as a thinly-veiled message to Art Garfunkel\, referring to a specific incident where Garfunkel went to Mexico to act in the film Catch-22. Simon was left alone in New York writing songs for Bridge over Troubled Water\, hence the lonely feelings of "The Only Living Boy In New York." Simon refers to Garfunkel in the song as Tom\, referring to their early days when they were called Tom and Jerry\, and encourages him to "let your honesty shine...like it shines on me". The background vocals feature both Garfunkel and Simon recorded together in an echo chamber\, multi-tracked around eight times.	0

"Ken" Griffin (December 28\, 1909 – March 11\, 1956) was an American organist. Griffin was born in Columbia\, Missouri. His biggest hit was "You Can't Be True\, Dear" (1948)\, which was first released as an instrumental\, and later that year re-released with a vocal by Jerry Wayne dubbed in. Both versions became popular\, selling over 3.5 million copies. He also starred in a 1954-55 syndicated television series\, 67 Melody Lane. He recorded on a variety of record labels including Columbia and Rondo. It was in the 1940s in Aurora\, Illinois that Griffin broke into the nightclub circuit\, playing at the Rivoli Cafe nightly. The sessions at the Rivoli cafe were broadcast on the radio station\, WMRO\, and the program became popular. Griffin died on March 11\, 1956 in Chicago\, Illinois at the age of 46\, of a heart attack and was buried at Lincoln Memorial Park in Aurora. Columbia had many hours of Griffin's unreleased recordings on tape\, and continued to release "new" recordings of Griffin's music for a number of years after his death.

The track was a no. 1 hit in the UK Singles Chart for three weeks in May 1979\, but despite this was not released as a single in the United States.  Song information  The song was written by Chris Stein and was the fourth single to be taken from the album\, Parallel Lines\, in the UK and most other parts of the world. The single had an unusual release in Australia\, with some dispute among fans as to whether it reached no. 1 there or failed to chart. This is because of its initial release as the lead single from Parallel Lines\, due to its being reminiscent of "In The Flesh"\, Blondie's first hit in Australia. "Sunday Girl" failed to chart\, however\, and was later re-released as a double A-side with "Heart of Glass"\, on the back of its UK success. As a result\, it was eclipsed by the disco track\, and is rarely recognised as having charted in its own right.  A French-language version of the track was released in the UK on the "Sunday Girl" 12" single; in France and the Netherlands\, it was the B-side of the 7". It also appears on the cassette release of Eat to the Beat. For Blondie's first greatest hits album The Best of Blondie in 1981\, producer Mike Chapman created a special mix which incorporated one verse sung in French. The bilingual version appears on the 2002 compilation Greatest Hits.  In 2010 a remake of this song was made by the English performer Florrie. It had slightly different lyrics and was used for a Nina Ricci perfume commercial. The song was covered in 2013 by the band She & Him on the album Volume 3.  In 2013 Blondie themselves re-recorded the song and offered it to be included in the CBGB's film soundtrack. This version was included on their 2014 compilation album Greatest Hits Deluxe Redux. The compilation was part of a 2-disc set called Blondie 4(0) Ever which included their 10th studio album Ghosts of Download and marked the 40th anniversary of the forming of the band.

COL title VAL Takin' Care of Business COL performer VAL Kurtis Blow	COL video title VAL Maddox Brothers & Rose - No Help Wanted COL channel name VAL HillbillyBoogie1 COL description VAL The Maddox Brothers and Rose\, known as America's Most Colorful Hillbilly Band from the 1930s to the 1950s\, consisted of four brothers\, Fred\, Cal\, Cliff and Don Maddox\, along with their sister Rose. Cliff died in 1949 and was replaced by brother Henry. The group disbanded in 1956.  The family hailed from Boaz\, Alabama\, but rode the rails and hitch hiked to California in 1933 when the band members were still children\, following the failed efforts of their sharecropper parents during the early part of the Depression. They were a little in advance of the flood of Okies who were to flood the state in the 30s. They struggled to make a living as intinerant fruit and vegetable pickers following the harvest as far north as Washington state\, and as far east as Arizona\, as well as in the San Joaquin Valley. They often worked from dawn to dusk\, sleeping and eating on the ground.  Having settled in Modesto\, the family developed their musical ability and\, in 1937 performed on the radio\, sponsored by a local furniture store. In 1939 they entered a hillbilly band competition at the centenial Sacramento State Fair after driving to Sacramento in their Model A. When they took the stage they tore through "Sally Let Your Bangs Hang Down" with rocking rhythms and risque lyrics. They became\, officially\, California's best hillbilly band.  The brothers and Rose appeared at places such as the 97th Street Corral in Los Angles.  From 1946-1951 the group recorded for 4 Star Records (Hollywood)\, then for Columbia Records. Some 4 Star masters were leased and released by US.-Decca Records at the beginning of the 1950s. The following quotes are from Rose Maddox. "We were called hillbilly singers - not country - then. No\, none of this country music then. People just called us hillbilly... People tell me that I was one of the first women to sing what I sang - country boogie. I guess I was. There was no rock 'n' roll in those early days\, before 1955. Only country boogie. My brothers also played that way. We called it country then.  The Maddox's material ranged from the country standards of Hank Williams and Merle Travis\, cowboy songs\, to the Western swing of Bob Wills\, to old-time\, folk\, and church singing\, to jazz\, swing\, boogie woogie and even a taste of early rock and roll.  Fred Maddox played upright bass using the "slap bass" technique as early as 1937.[5] This trademark backbeat\, a slapping bass style\, helped drive a broad change in popular music\, sporting a faster\, immediately discernible rhythm that came to be known as rockabilly.  Fred Maddox's bass is displayed at the Experience Music Project in Seattle. "They wanted his bass because they believe he might have hit the first note of rock 'n' roll on it.	0

Thomas\, Bill Medley\, Chuck Leavell and Judith Hill  Ever since his glorious surprise version of “The Way You Look Tonight” in the 1991 film “Father of The Bride” paved the way for his extraordinary second career as a GRAMMY Award winning vocalist/producer\, Steve Tyrell has been setting A New Standard (the title of his 1999 debut album) for interpreting the Great American Songbook – most notably on Songs of Sinatra (which reached #5 on the Billboard Jazz Albums chart) and his most recent Concord Records release\, It’s Magic: The Songs of Sammy Cahn (#2). On his 11th album\, That Lovin’ Feeling\, he celebrates what he calls “the Great American Songbook 2; the next generation of the Songbook\,” recording seminal rock era classics penned by legendary songwriters (many renowned for hits penned at New York’s famed Brill Building) who are also cherished longtime friends.   While sharing the enduring magic of timeless songs by the songwriting teams of Carole King and Gerry Goffin\, Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller\, Barry Mann & Cynthia Weil and Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich as well as Burt Bacharach\, Neil Sedaka\, Toni Wine and Carole Bayer Sager\, That Lovin’ Feeling sets itself apart from most tribute recordings with spirited guest vocal appearances by Mann\, B.J. Thomas\, Neil Sedaka and Bill Medley in addition to renowned backup singer Judith Hill (featured in the Oscar winning documentary “20 Feet From Stardom”) and Tyrell’s daughter Lauryn Tyrell.

Eindringlich\, lasziv\, ganz nah."   Elly Lapp liebt die Brückenschläge. Für sie sind UFA-Schlager und Popmusik keine  unarrangierbaren Gegensätze\, sondern interpretatorische Herausforderung. Dabei ist eine sehr moderne CD entstanden\,  die gleichzeitig sehr intensiv und sehr persönlich ist. Viel näher geht`s nicht.   Es waren große Songs -- es sind große Songs. Dazu leistet eine interessante Interpretin ihren Beitrag. Elly Lapp. Die studierte Schauspielerin und Sängerin tourt mit eigenen Programmen durch Deutschland -- und sie war die Stimme des Titelsongs der erfolgreichen ARD-Fernsehserie „Kir Royal".  „Der Wind hat mir ein Lied erzählt" - gleichzeitig erste Single - und „Ich steh` im Regen" sind Versuche einer ungewöhnlichen Verbindung von UFA - HIT und POPSOUND. Zarah Leander machte einst diese Songs zu Welterfolgen. Damals hatten die Autoren wohl nie eine Umsetzung mit rockigen Gitarren oder Saxophon im Auge. Hier geben die modernen Instrumente\, wie das gesamte Pop- Arrangement\, eine ganz neue Farbe -- voller Intensität.  Doch die CD von Elly Lapp zeigt die großen Filmhits nicht nur im Popgewand\, sondern auch sehr sparsam\, kunstvoll arrangiert\, als Chansons mit großer interpretatorischer Tiefe.  z.B." Wenn ich mir was wünschen dürfte" und - vor allem - „Der Nowack lässt mich nicht verkommen" -\, ein wahrer Kultsong\, 1959 geschrieben\, sofort auf Schallplatte aufgenommen\, kurzerhand von einem Münchner Gericht verboten und wieder eingestampft -- eine echte Rarität für jedes Rundfunk- und Privatarchiv!	0

At the dawn of the new millennium\, songwriter\, producer\, and multi- instrumentalist Klayton created Celldweller\, a ground-breaking aural entity for the next age. Thriving on originality\, Celldweller cross-bred electronic styles such as Drum'n'Bass and Psy-Trance with modern Alternative Rock and Metal on his self-titled debut\, released independently in 2003.  The Celldweller album met with critical acclaim while climbing to #17 on the Billboard Internet Sales Chart. Celldweller gained Top 40 Metal Radio charting with the track "I Believe You" pulling into a solid 11th place on the R&R Alternative Specialty Show Chart. Achieving a feat shared by only an elite handful of albums\, every song on Celldweller was eventually licensed for use in popular media. These songs were heard in movie trailers\, TV shows\, and games such as Spider Man 2\, Constantine\, Crackdown\, Need for Speed: Most Wanted\, Enter the Matrix\, CSI\, UFC\, The Shield\, and more.  Now\, Celldweller has been reissued to celebrate the tenth anniversary of its release with updated artwork and a second disc of remixes\, demos\, and previously unheard rarities (all remastered for this release). While Klayton busies himself in his Detroit studio preparing the future of Celldweller for 2013\, celebrate the past with this monumental work.  Want to use FiXT music in your YouTube videos?

Damita Jo\, was an American actress\, comedian\, and lounge music performer. DeBlanc was born in Austin\, Texas\,[2] the featured vocalist on recordings from Steve Gibson and the Red Caps during the 1950s.[3] She later went on to marry Gibson\, but they parted ways professionally and personally in 1959.  Credited as simply Damita Jo\, DeBlanc had some chart success in the early 1960s with two answer songs: 1960's "I'll Save the Last Dance for You" (an answer to "Save the Last Dance for Me") and 1961's "I'll Be There" (an answer to "Stand By Me"). Both songs were originally sung by Ben E. King and made the R&B top 20\, and "I'll Be There" also reached number 12 on the pop chart. In 1962 she recorded "Dance With a Dolly (With a Hole in her Stocking)"\, previously made famous by The Andrews Sisters and Bill Haley\, for Mercury Records. In 1966 she had a minor hit with a cover of the Jacques Brel song "If You Go Away."  She worked with Ray Charles\, Count Basie\, and Lionel Hampton. And\, in 1963\, she released a recording for Mercury Records with Billy Eckstine and Bobby Tucker Orchestra.  Damita Jo was later involved in comedy and toured with Redd Foxx.

COL title VAL Everyday Will Be Like a Holiday COL performer VAL Curtis Salgado and The Stilettos	COL video title VAL Hall & Oates - Everyday Will Be Like A Holiday COL channel name VAL thatMimosaGrove COL description VAL 4th track from "Home For Christmas" (2006). The grammarian in me wants to change the spelling from "Everyday" to "Every Day." But who cares\, right? All that really matters is that the biggest-selling duo in Yacht Rock history has made a Christmas album!  On this track\, Hall and Oates cover William Bell and Booker T. Jones' classic R&B tune\, retaining not only the original spelling of the title but the warm vibe as well. But while the original song doesn't actually mention Christmas by name\, in typical Daryl Hall fashion\, the lyrics have been altered slightly and now leave no doubt about the holiday in question. In addition\, the duo gives this song—like all the others on the album—a smooth\, slick veneer that's nevertheless earthy\, friendly\, and comforting.   "Every day will be like a holiday / When my baby\, when my baby comes home Here she comes / I think I see her right now..."  They've really got my believing it!   ~thatMimosaGrove  P.S. – I plan to upload\, if not all\, at least a few more songs from this excellent album (which\, btw\, is weighted on the side of the sacred and reverential—a definite plus in my book). I started with this particular song because I couldn't find the album version on YouTube. Hope you enjoy!  source: http://www.allmusic.com/album/home-for-christmas-mw0000561312  *  Additional Musicians on the album: Tom "T-Bone" Wolk: bass guitar\, acoustic & electric guitars Greg Bieck: programming & keyboards Rob Mathes: acoustic guitars\, keyboards\, string arrangements & conductor Shawn Pelton: drums David Sancious: organ\, piano\, additional backing vocals Charles DeChant: saxophone Michael Payne: additional acoustic & electric guitars Matthew Payne: drums Klyde Jones: additional backing vocals Strings performed by the London Session Orchestra Gavyn Wright: concertmaster & first violinist Isobel Griffiths: string contractor Vic Fraiser: librarian Music preparation by Mike & Lori Castreel  Production: Produced by Daryl Hall\, T-Bone Wolk & Greg Bieck Recorded & Mixed by Greg Bieck Engineered by Greg Bieck\, Peter Moshay\, Jamie Rosenberg & Peter Cobbin Assistant Engineers: Katzutaka Noda\, Taz Mattar & Louis Jones Mastered by Bob Ludwig Album Cover Art: Michael McCurdy Album Design & Packaging: Kathy Phillips  source: Wikipedia  ***  Image Credits (other than album art and artist publicity photos): Desiree Kane / Morgan Rains / Alfonso / Eustaquio Santimano / Cassia Noelle / Heather Bradley / Bert Kaufmann / open-arms / tom brindley / peaceful-jp-scenery https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/legalcode	1

The band that includes members of THE NO TALENTS\, LES SYNAPSES\, DUTRONC\, CECILIA UND DIE SAUERKRAUTS & OPERATION S goes back to the sound of the French Beat & Roll when it was bitten by the Big Bad British Bug back in 1965. Imagine how THEM\, THE SMALL FACES\, THE YARDBIRDS or the early STONES would've sound if they were from France\, never turned professionals and Van Morrison\, Keith Relf or Mike Jagger were chicks. All the songs are in French\, with that glamorous 'mademoiselle' accent! The band could've been described best as the great french sixties rock band that should have existed but never did. Owing to cultural impediments and lame business practices\, there were very few outstanding french rockers from that period. Ronnie Bird\, Larry Greco\, and a dozen others you've never heard of: LES TERRIBLES cover them all\, and every song makes you wanna dance. The band rounds out their set with some originals\, as well as their own french versions of some great foreign songs that never got adapted before\, all done with a perfect ear for the style. Fronted by the charming and talented chanteuse Rudie this hard-working orchestre delivers the groove that gets the dance floor moving to the Swim\, the Jerk\, and the Hully-Gully. Les Terribles are sur scene ! ((Jon Dragueur) A Top 10 forever-must have this one is. What more can we tell you?	0

The dust has only just begun to fall\, Crop circles in the carpet\, sinking\, feeling. Spin me 'round again and rub my eyes. This can't be happening. When busy streets amass with people Would stop to hold their heads heavy.  Hide and seek. Trains and sewing machines. All those years they were here first.  Oily marks appear on walls Where pleasure moments hung before. The takeover\, the sweeping insensitivity of this still life.  Hide and seek. Trains and sewing machines. (Oh\, you won't catch me around here) Blood and tears (hearts)\, They were here first.  Mmm\, what you say? Mm\, that you only meant well? Well\, of course you did. Mmm\, what you say? Mm\, that it's all for the best? Of course it is. Mmm\, what you say? Mm\, that it's just what we need? And you decided this. What you say? Mmm\, what did She say?  Ransom notes keep falling out your mouth. Mid-sweet talk\, newspaper word cut-outs. Speak no feeling\, no I don't believe you. You don't care a bit. You don't care a bit.  (hide and seek) Ransom notes keep falling out your mouth. Mid-sweet talk\, newspaper word cut-outs. (hide and seek) Speak no feeling\, no I don't believe you. You don't care a bit. You don't care a bit.  (hide and seek) You don't care a bit. You don't care a bit. You don't care a bit. (hide and seek) You don't care a bit. You don't care a bit.  #imogenheap #hideandseek #normalpeople #hulu #bbc #imogenheaphideandseek	0

I am going through the whole collection and putting all of them online.  I started this channel because posting all of this music on my main mining and carpentry channel was driving subscribers away.  Some of the stuff is kind of rare and a bunch of it will be the only copy on youtube.  In theory all of these records are for sale if you want them.  Message me in the comments.   All of the records are being played on Zenith 6R-668 tube type radio and record player.  When I picked it up from the leftovers pile at the estate it was not working.  While not a record player expert by any means\, I was able to get it operable.  The needle is rough but after carefully reshaping it on a diamond stone I got it to play much better.  So far no replacement needle can be located.  I found one that fit the holder but it was the newer style and didn't work with 78's.  You can get a look at the player by following this link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YCtwrOdGb8 We have no intention of fighting any content challenges; even the bogus ones and so will simply acknowledge and move on.  My only goal is to put it out there before it is gone.  In theory any of these records is for sale and you need but drop me a line in the comments.  I do intend to monetize but understand we are talking a predicted whole channel income of less than $5 a month.  Anything helps and this take a lot of times so please don't hate me for that. --Ken	0

COL title VAL Damn Your Eyes COL performer VAL The Cache Valley Drifters	COL video title VAL Bert Kaempfert - The Way It Used To Be COL channel name VAL Socratess2007 COL description VAL Bert Kaempfert knew exactly which 'hitparade' songs could be 'transformed' into a "Kaempfert classic".  When Engelbert Humperdinck scored a major hit with "The Way it used to Be" in 1968\, Bert heard right away that this magnificent melody had all the elements it took for a 'new' Kaempfert track.  Bert obviously wrote a new orchestral arrangement\, where after a "new easy listening classic" was born :)  The album "Traces Of Love" - from which the track is taken - breathes quality from beginning to end.   Here we can listen to a Bert Kaempfert 'at his best' - bringing his tunes with an even larger orchestra and with audio technicians (eg Peter Klemt) behind the controls who make use of the newest recording technology available (at the time\, ie in 1969). If ever the term "heavenly music" could be used\, it sure is here.  Bert Kaempfert created music\, that\, without any doubt\, will please audiences for generations to come. From the 1969 album "Traces Of Love" here is "Mister Hitmaker" once again bringing you "The Way It Used To Be".  Enjoy.	0

COL title VAL Johanna ifrån Orleans COL performer VAL Ebba Forsberg	COL video title VAL Joan of Arc (Leonard Cohen) - Allison Crowe w. lyrics COL channel name VAL Allison Crowe COL description VAL On her debut album "secrets" Allison Crowe covers this Leonard Cohen song. Her voice and piano is accompanied by Jo Lundstrom (Rosehip Jam\, Black Velvet Band) on accordion. Crowe engineered the recording\, with production by Rainer Willeke (of Victoria\, B.C.'s Raindog Studios).  http://music.allisoncrowe.com/track/joan-of-arc  The photo of Allison Crowe is by Billie Woods.  MOJO magazine's December '08 issue paid tribute to "Rock's Greatest Poet" Leonard Cohen with a celebration of his "deep and moving music". Of Allison Crowe's contribution of "Joan of Arc" to its 'All Star Tribute"\, (featuring Judy Collins\, Nick Cave\, Katie Melua\, Martha Wainwright\, Dion and others)\, a cover-mount CD titled "Cohen Covered"\, MOJO says: "Once famously described by the Vancouver Courier as possessing a style akin to 'Elton John meets Edith Piaf'\, the Canadian singer-songwriter Allison Crowe is renowned for her ability to blend control and melodrama. Certainly she does so on this spirited cover of Cohen's 'Songs of Love and Hate' classic\, a track which also powerfully showcases her considerable talent as a fine interpreter of song."  "Any album that features a track from Leonard Cohen is certainly heading in the right direction. But when it is covered so beautifully\, it makes you realise what an amazing lyricist Leonard Cohen is. Joan of Arc is the Cohen song covered on this album and it's certainly in my top 10 of Cohen covers. It's also my favorite track on (Secrets)" ~ Colin Meeks\, indielaunchpad.com (USA)  Joan of Arc  Words & Music by Leonard Cohen As performed by Allison Crowe  Now the flames they followed Joan of Arc as she came riding through the dark; no moon to keep her armour bright\, no man to get her through this dark and smoky night.   She said\, "I'm tired of the war\, I want the kind of work I had before\, A wedding dress or something white to wear upon my swollen appetite."  Well\, I'm glad to hear you talk this way\, I've watched you riding every day and there is something in me that yearns to win such a cold\, such a lonesome heroine.  "And who are you?" she sternly spoke to the one beneath the smoke. "Why\, I'm fire\," he replied\, "And I love your solitude\, I love your pride."  "Well\, then\, fire make your body cold\, I'm going to give you mine to hold." And saying this she climbed inside to be his one\, to be his only bride.  Then deep into his fiery heart he took the dust of Joan of Arc\, and high above all these wedding guests he hung the ashes of her lovely wedding dress.  It was deep into his fiery heart he took the dust of Joan of Arc\, and then she clearly understood if he was fire\, oh\, she must be wood.  I saw her wince\, I saw her cry\, I saw the glory in her eye. Myself I long for love and light\, but must it come so cruel\,  must it be so bright?	1

I am going through the whole collection and putting all of them online.  I started this channel because posting all of this music on my main mining and carpentry channel was driving subscribers away.  Some of the stuff is kind of rare and a bunch of it will be the only copy on youtube.  In theory all of these records are for sale if you want them.  Message me in the comments.   All of the records are being played on Zenith 6R-668 tube type radio and record player.  When I picked it up from the leftovers pile at the estate it was not working.  While not a record player expert by any means\, I was able to get it operable.  The needle is rough but after carefully reshaping it on a diamond stone I got it to play much better.  So far no replacement needle can be located.  I found one that fit the holder but it was the newer style and didn't work with 78's.  You can get a look at the player by following this link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YCtwrOdGb8 We have no intention of fighting any content challenges; even the bogus ones and so will simply acknowledge and move on.  My only goal is to put it out there before it is gone.  In theory any of these records is for sale and you need but drop me a line in the comments.  I do intend to monetize but understand we are talking a predicted whole channel income of less than $5 a month.  Anything helps and this take a lot of times so please don't hate me for that. --Ken	0

This was the title track from one of Pat Boone's better-selling albums from June 1961.  Lуяιcѕ ❤️  Thanks for sharing info about Chase Webster (Gary D. Bruce)\, the writer of this great song and who recorded it first.  Link to his version and the original.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VRwVrk1EmU  Fun bit of trivia:  Moody River was written by Gary D Bruce and first recorded by him in 1961 using his performer name Chase Webster. His original words were "more deadly than the SHARPEST knife" but during the recording session the P in "sharPest" kept popping so rather than find a different mike\, Gary (Chase) changed sharpest to "VAINEST" on the spot and probably very little if any thought went into the meaning of vainest.  When Pat Boone recorded it a couple of months later Dot Records chief\, Randy Wood checked to make sure the lyric was correct before releasing the record. Pat Boone says he had no idea what a "vainest knife" was and just sang the lyrics as written. Pat's Moody River topped the charts on June 17\, 1961.  Lуяιcѕ ♥  (Moody River Moody River) Moody River more deadly Than the vainest knife Moody River your muddy water Took my baby's life  Last Saturday evening I came to the old oak tree It stands beside the river Where you were to meet me  On the ground your glove I found With a note addressed to me It read dear love I've done you wrong Now I must set you free  No longer can I live With this hurt and this sin I just couldn't tell you That guy was just a friend  Moody River more deadly Than the vainest knife Moody River your muddy water Took my baby's life  I looked into the muddy waters And what could I see I saw a lonely lonely face  Just looking back at me  Tears in his eyes And a prayer on his lips And the glove of his lost love At his fingertips  Moody River more deadly Than the vainest knife Moody River your muddy water Took my baby's life	0

COL title VAL Some Velvet Morning COL performer VAL My Dying Bride	COL video title VAL Nancy Sinatra & Lee Hazlewood: Some Velvet Morning COL channel name VAL calicomoonchild COL description VAL The second song I ever really loved.   I have loved & lived with this song all my life and it is one of my favourite top 10 tracks of all time.   Track Meaning:  One day when the male character in the song is sober and has his head "straight"\, he will impart something of significance to his current love about his earliest & deepest love\, a woman named "pheadra" whose memory he is still haunted by.  Hence the repetition of the Pheadra/ Nancy portion of the song . . .  her section symbolising the "haunting" and struggle inside his head as he tries to gain "closure" from this past relationship with a mysterious former love Pheadra . . . his part of the song being directed to his new lover in the present.    His present lack of sobriety (drunkeness) describing his vain attempts to drown out the all consuming memory of this mysterious former love\, a memory that he is aware is annoying his present lover and describes his fear that she may leave him as a result of his "haunting" by his old (first)love.  Note:  At the point in history this song was written the labels of "straight" (meaning hetrosexual) and "gay" (meaning homosexual) did not yet exist.  In fact by the late sixties the term "gay" was just another word for "happy".	1

COL title VAL Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat COL performer VAL Beck	COL video title VAL You're Just In Love - Perry Como COL channel name VAL Maureen712 COL description VAL "You're Just in Love" is a popular song by Irving Berlin. It was published in 1950 and was first performed by Ethel Merman and Russell Nype in Call Me Madam\, a musical comedy that debuted at the Imperial Theatre in New York City on October 12 that year. The show ran for 644 performances. Ethel Merman also later starred in the 1953 film version. Theatre lore has it that Berlin wrote the song one night after Call Me Madam was not doing well in tryouts. The second act of the show was lacking. "What I'd like to do is a song with the kid (Russell Nype)\," Merman said. So\, Berlin went to his room and later produced the counterpoint song. When Berlin played the song for Merman\, she said "We'll never get off the stage." According to Berlin's biographer though\, Berlin played the song for Russell Nype first\, but admonished him not to admit he did so because it would infuriate Merman.  Several recorded versions made the charts in 1950-51: by Perry Como and The Fontane Sisters\, by Rosemary Clooney and Guy Mitchell\, and by Ethel Merman and Dick Haymes.  The Perry Como/Fontane Sisters version was recorded on September 26\, 1950 and released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number 20-3945. The record first reached the Billboard magazine charts on December 22\, 1950 and lasted 17 weeks on the chart\, peaking at #5.  The Rosemary Clooney/Guy Mitchell version was recorded on October 21\, 1950 and released by Columbia Records as catalog number 39052. The record first reached the Billboard magazine charts on February 23\, 1951 and lasted 2 weeks on the chart\, peaking at #29.  The Ethel Merman/Dick Haymes version was recorded on October 17\, 1950 and released by Decca Records as catalog number 27317. The record first reached the Billboard magazine charts on March 30\, 1951 and lasted 1 week on the chart\, at #30. Although the lowest charting of the three\, it got a considerable amount of airplay in subsequent years.  Musically\, the song is one of Irving Berlin's three well-known songs that use true counterpoint—a main melody with a secondary melody running at the same time\, both with independent lyrics - his two other best-known counterpoint songs are Play a Simple Melody and "An Old-Fashioned Wedding" (see the 1966 revival of "Annie Get Your Gun").	0

COL title VAL From Four Until Late COL performer VAL Delta-Cross Band	COL video title VAL Hoagy Carmichael - Little Old Lady COL channel name VAL 2ndviolinist COL description VAL From www.hoagy.com  Hoagland Howard Carmichael was born in 1899 in Bloomington. His father was an itinerant laborer who moved his family throughout the Midwest looking for steady work\, always returning to Indiana. "Home" was back in Bloomington\, where they'd left his wife Lida's golden oak piano. She helped support the family by playing at the local movie house and for university dances. "Ragtime was my lullaby\," Hoagy said\, and though his mother was thrilled when he picked out a tune on the golden oak\, she warned him: "Music is fun\, Hoagland\, but it don't buy you cornpone."  Lida Carmichael thought her son might grow up to be president of a railroad. He might have\, too\, because ambition burned hot in him\, but in 1919 he heard Louie Jordan's band (not to be confused with Louis Jordan who had a popular band in the thirties) in Indianapolis and this black ensemble of early jazz players "exploded in me almost more music than I could consume." Hoagy went on to study law at Indiana University but he was already a "jazz maniac" and his own band\, The Carmichael Syringe Orchestra\, was made up of a gang of loose cannons whose spiritual leader was a Dada-inspired poet named Monk. "There are other things in this world besides hot music\," Monk advised Hoagy in a serious moment\, "I forget what they are--but they're around." Those 'other things' were named Dorothy Kelly\, and to Hoagy she was more than first love. Dorothy was a secure respectable life in one of those big houses up on the hill in Bloomington he'd dreamt of as a boy\, and when he held her in his arms\, that was what he wanted more than anything else.  Then Hoagy heard a young white cornetist named Bix Beiderbecke and\, "it threw my judgment out of kilter." This was a sound like nothing he'd heard before and when Hoagy played an improvised tune for Bix\, the strange young man with a magical horn said\, "Whyn't you write music\, Hoagy?" The rest of his life was the answer to Bix's question.  Many years later\, when an audience saw the mature Hoagy sitting at the piano singing "Lazybones" or "Ole Buttermilk Sky" in what he called his 'native wood-note and flatsy- through-the-nose voice\,' it looked so natural and relaxed that it was easy to assume he'd led a charmed life. But Hoagy's road to success was just as bumpy and lurching as his friend Bix's was smooth and quick.After a modest but deceptive early success with "Washboard Blues" and "Riverboat Shuffle\," Hoagy packed a bag and went to New York. But he soon found himself scuffling around the cold\, lonely town\, not selling anything but bonds in a bottom-end job at a Wall St. brokerage house. "I'm singing the music publisher's theme song-it ain't a commercial\," he wrote back to Monk. He tried to give up--more than once--but the words of another old friend kept him going. Reggie Duval\, a black barber and dance hall pianist in Indianapolis\, was the only teacher Hoagy ever had besides his mother. Reggie had taught Hoagy how to make music 'jump' and also gave him a creed to live by: "Never play anything that don't sound right. You might not make any money--but at least you won't get hostile with yourself."  Hoagy kept writing what sounded 'right' and in 1930 made recordings of "Georgia On My Mind\," "Rockin' Chair\," and "Lazy River." Other artists heard the new songs and within a year Louis Armstrong\, Duke Ellington and the Dorsey brothers had recorded their own versions and were performing them on the new hot medium\, radio. Hoagy Carmichael himself was still barely known to the public\, but they were hearing and singing his songs\, and in 1936 Hoagy went to Hollywood where "the rainbow hits the ground for composers."  During the next decade\, Hoagy moved from backstage into the spotlight. He worked with lyricists Johnny Mercer\, Frank Loesser and Mitchell Parish. He became a star performer on records\, radio and stage with a signature style\, and began appearing in movies\, most memorably in "To Have and Have Not" and "The Best Years of Our Lives". He got married and fathered two sons. In one year\, 1946\, he had three of the top four songs on the Hit Parade\, and in 1951 he and Mercer won an Oscar for "In the Cool\, Cool\, Cool of the Evening." He hosted his own television show\, "The Saturday Night Review."  'Hoagy' was no longer a peculiar name\, he was a star\, even an American icon. He was also someone you knew\, a guy you wished you could have a drink and share a laugh with. He had the same joys and desires\, disappointments and fears you had\, and some of his songs--"Lazy River\," "Heart and Soul"-- became so familiar they sounded as if no one had written them\, they'd just always been there.	0

Joey DeFrancesco Composed: Sam Jones Cd: "Like That"\, Recording Date: August 30\, 1995 - August 31\, 1995  Release Date: April 30\, 1996   Subscribe Here: http://www.youtube.com/user/TheSouLighting http://www.facebook.com/thesoulighting  Jimmy Bruno\, born July 22\, 1953 in Philadelphia\, Pennsylvania\, is a master jazz guitarist and jazz educator. He started playing at the age of 7. He began his professional career at the age of 19\, touring with Buddy Rich. Among his many credits\, he is the only guitarist to have ever led Frank Sinatra's band. He played for many years in Los Angeles before returning to the Philadelphia area. He counts Johnny Smith\, Hank Garland\, Joe Pass\, Tal Farlow\, Wes Montgomery\, Howard Roberts\, Jim Hall\, and Pat Martino amongst his influences. In March\, 2011 Jimmy opened up Jimmy Bruno's Guitar Workshop\, a website that allows students to learn directly from Jimmy through video lessons.  For more information: http://jimmybruno.com/biography.php  Although Like That was recorded in New York\, many of the people involved with the project were Philadelphians. The pleasing hard bop date unites Jimmy Bruno's Philly-based trio of the 1990s (which includes bassist Craig Thomas and drummer Steve Holloway) with organist/trumpeter and Philly native Joey DeFrancesco\, Although DeFrancesco plays organ on most of the 11 songs\, he switches to the trumpet and favors a Miles Davis-influenced mute on relaxed versions of "There Is No Greater Love" and "Stars Fell on Alabama."   Ο Jimmy Bruno γεννήθηκε στις 22 Ιουλίου 1953\, στην Πενσυλβάνια και είναι ένας Αμερικανός master κιθαρίστας και διδάσκαλος της τζαζ. Παίζει από ηλικία 7 ετών και ξεκίνησε την επαγγελματική του καριέρα στην ηλικία των 19\, περιοδεύοντας με τον Buddy Rich. Μεταξύ των πολλών του διακρίσεων\, είναι ότι ήταν ο μόνος επικεφαλής κιθαρίστας της μπάντας του Frank Sinatra. Έπαιξε για πολλά χρόνια στο Λος Άντζελες πριν από την επιστροφή στην  Φιλαδέλφεια. Έχει επηρεαστεί\, μεταξύ άλλων\, από τους  Johnny Smith\, Hank Garland\, Joe Pass\, Tal Farlow\, Wes Montgomery\, Howard Roberts\, Jim Hall\, and Pat Martino. Από τον Μάρτιο του 2011\, άνοιξε την ιστοσελίδα: Jimmy Bruno's Guitar Workshop\,  που επιτρέπει στους μαθητές του να εξασκηθούν απευθείας από τον Bruno μέσω βίντεο μαθημάτων. Περισσότερες πληροφορίες: http://jimmybruno.com/biography.php  Το μουσικό κομμάτι “Unit Seven” είναι το από το cd του 1996 με τίτλο “Like That”\, που ηχογραφήθηκε στη Νέα Υόρκη και οι περισσότεροι μουσικοί ήταν από την Φιλαδέλφεια. Στο βασικό του τρίο (με μπάσσο τον Craig Thomas και ντράμμερ τον Steve Holloway) της περιόδου του 1990\, προστέθηκε ο  οργανίστας/τρομπετίστας Joey DeFrancesco (επίσης από την Φιλαδέλφεια).

COL title VAL Stand COL performer VAL Third World	COL video title VAL Maddox Brothers & Rose - No Help Wanted COL channel name VAL HillbillyBoogie1 COL description VAL The Maddox Brothers and Rose\, known as America's Most Colorful Hillbilly Band from the 1930s to the 1950s\, consisted of four brothers\, Fred\, Cal\, Cliff and Don Maddox\, along with their sister Rose. Cliff died in 1949 and was replaced by brother Henry. The group disbanded in 1956.  The family hailed from Boaz\, Alabama\, but rode the rails and hitch hiked to California in 1933 when the band members were still children\, following the failed efforts of their sharecropper parents during the early part of the Depression. They were a little in advance of the flood of Okies who were to flood the state in the 30s. They struggled to make a living as intinerant fruit and vegetable pickers following the harvest as far north as Washington state\, and as far east as Arizona\, as well as in the San Joaquin Valley. They often worked from dawn to dusk\, sleeping and eating on the ground.  Having settled in Modesto\, the family developed their musical ability and\, in 1937 performed on the radio\, sponsored by a local furniture store. In 1939 they entered a hillbilly band competition at the centenial Sacramento State Fair after driving to Sacramento in their Model A. When they took the stage they tore through "Sally Let Your Bangs Hang Down" with rocking rhythms and risque lyrics. They became\, officially\, California's best hillbilly band.  The brothers and Rose appeared at places such as the 97th Street Corral in Los Angles.  From 1946-1951 the group recorded for 4 Star Records (Hollywood)\, then for Columbia Records. Some 4 Star masters were leased and released by US.-Decca Records at the beginning of the 1950s. The following quotes are from Rose Maddox. "We were called hillbilly singers - not country - then. No\, none of this country music then. People just called us hillbilly... People tell me that I was one of the first women to sing what I sang - country boogie. I guess I was. There was no rock 'n' roll in those early days\, before 1955. Only country boogie. My brothers also played that way. We called it country then.  The Maddox's material ranged from the country standards of Hank Williams and Merle Travis\, cowboy songs\, to the Western swing of Bob Wills\, to old-time\, folk\, and church singing\, to jazz\, swing\, boogie woogie and even a taste of early rock and roll.  Fred Maddox played upright bass using the "slap bass" technique as early as 1937.[5] This trademark backbeat\, a slapping bass style\, helped drive a broad change in popular music\, sporting a faster\, immediately discernible rhythm that came to be known as rockabilly.  Fred Maddox's bass is displayed at the Experience Music Project in Seattle. "They wanted his bass because they believe he might have hit the first note of rock 'n' roll on it.	0

Talk about a lead singer being camera shy - you only saw his face maybe 5 or 6 times during the performance. Most of the time his back was to the audience. Being that I saw them over 44 yrs ago\, the only thing that I can remember about them was that they didn't seem very tight and they still looked like they were trying to find their place. I can't recall any songs that they did\, although I do recall that two of them were blues covers."	0

There ain't no right and wrong -- we're like the chimpanzees Oh\, that ain't workin' -- macroevolution Monkeys for uncles in your history  Listen up  Oh\, that ain't workin' -- that's the way I view it I beg to differ on your empty theory That ain't workin' -- that's no way to prove it Get your monkeys for uncles in your history Monkeys for uncles -- history Monkeys for uncles -- missing links  I want my\, I want my\, I want my missing links I want my\, I want my\, I want my missing links  Romans 1:21 For although they knew God\, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him\, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened.	0

COL title VAL Tramp COL performer VAL ZZ Top	COL video title VAL Ruth Brown - Never Let Me Go COL channel name VAL sanny blues COL description VAL A Good Day For The Blues ....Ruth Brown (1928-2006) was a rhythm & blues singer-songwriter\, record producer\, composer and actress noted for bringing a pop music style to rhythm & blues music. Backed by a bevy of New Orleans jazz and soul vets\, Brown delivers a series of horn-inflected\, indigo ballads like "Never Let Me Go\," "True\," and "The Richest One" that unearth the blues with an unruffled dignity reminiscent of Nina Simone or a less fragile Billie Holiday. On most of the rest of the material\, Brown invokes her Broadway experience to become the archetypal blues mama who "don't take no mess." In that vein\, "H.B.'s Funky Fable" is a humorous talk-sung tale for kids of all ages\, and "Cabbage Head" resurrects the minstrel-vaudeville days of Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith with hilarious aplomb\, as Brown nails the bawdy vernacular and trumpeter Abram Wilson spools out brassy asides that evoke the period perfectly.	0

Well\, don't forget to bring this platter to the DJ! This band from Paris\, France plays an incredible mix of 60's garage-punk & GoGo Beat and now finally returns with their second longplayer 'Ils sont formidables!'. The band that includes members of THE NO TALENTS\, LES SYNAPSES\, DUTRONC\, CECILIA UND DIE SAUERKRAUTS & OPERATION S goes back to the sound of the French Beat & Roll when it was bitten by the Big Bad British Bug back in 1965. Imagine how THEM\, THE SMALL FACES\, THE YARDBIRDS or the early STONES would've sound if they were from France\, never turned professionals and Van Morrison\, Keith Relf or Mike Jagger were chicks. All the songs are in French\, with that glamorous 'mademoiselle' accent! The band could've been described best as the great french sixties rock band that should have existed but never did. Owing to cultural impediments and lame business practices\, there were very few outstanding french rockers from that period. Ronnie Bird\, Larry Greco\, and a dozen others you've never heard of: LES TERRIBLES cover them all\, and every song makes you wanna dance. The band rounds out their set with some originals\, as well as their own french versions of some great foreign songs that never got adapted before\, all done with a perfect ear for the style. Fronted by the charming and talented chanteuse Rudie this hard-working orchestre delivers the groove that gets the dance floor moving to the Swim\, the Jerk\, and the Hully-Gully. Les Terribles are sur scene ! ((Jon Dragueur) A Top 10 forever-must have this one is. What more can we tell you?	0

COL title VAL Separate Ways (Worlds Apart) COL performer VAL Journey	COL video title VAL Bill Keith Homestead on The Farm COL channel name VAL Marcus Brazil COL description VAL William Bradford Keith was born in Boston\, Massachusetts. He attended Amherst College and graduated in 1961. In 1963 he became a member of Bill Monroe's Bluegrass Boys.   Keith's recordings and performances during these nine months with Monroe permanently altered banjo playing\, and his style has become an important part of the playing styles of many banjoists. After leaving the Bluegrass Boys\, he joined "Jim Kweskin Jug Band" playing plectrum banjo. He began playing the steel guitar and soon after 1968\, found himself working together with Ian and Sylvia and Jonathan Edwards. In the 1970s Keith recorded for Rounder Records. Over the years he has performed with several other musicians\, such as Clarence White and David Grisman in Muleskinner\, Tony Trischka\, Jim Rooney and Jim Collier. Today\, Keith style is still regarded as modern or progressive in the context of bluegrass banjo playing.    Keith made a mechanical contribution to the banjo\, as well. He designed a specialized type of banjo tuning peg that facilitates changing quickly from one open tuning to another\, while playing. Earlier famed banjoist Earl Scruggs had designed a set of cams which were added to the banjo to perform this task. Keith's invention made the extra hardware unnecessary\, replacing two of the tuning machines already on the banjo — a more elegant solution. Scruggs himself became a partner in the venture for a while\, and the product was known as "Scruggs-Keith Pegs". Known today simply as Keith Pegs\, they remain the state of the art\, and Bill Keith continues to manufacture and market them personally as the primary product of his own company\, the Beacon Banjo Company.	0

Lyrics: Beauty queen of only eighteen She had some trouble with herself He was always there to help her She always belonged to someone else  I drove for miles and miles And wound up at your door I've had you so many times but somehow I want more  I don't mind spending everyday Out on your corner in the pouring rain Look for the girl with the broken smile Ask her if she wants to stay awhile And she will be loved She will be loved  Tap on my window knock on my door I want to make you feel beautiful I know I tend to get so insecure It doesn't matter anymore  It's not always rainbows and butterflies It's compromise that moves us along\, yeah My heart is full and my door's always open You can come anytime you want  I don't mind spending everyday Out on your corner in the pouring rain Look for the girl with the broken smile Ask her if she wants to stay awhile And she will be loved And she will be loved And she will be loved And she will be loved  I know where you hide Alone in your car Know all of the things that make you who you are I know that goodbye means nothing at all Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls  Tap on my window knock on my door I want to make you feel beautiful  I don't mind spending everyday Out on your corner in the pouring rain Look for the girl with the broken smile Ask her if she wants to stay awhile And she will be loved And she will be loved And she will be loved And she will be loved  [in the background] Please don't try so hard to say goodbye Please don't try so hard to say goodbye  Yeah  I don't mind spending everyday Out on your corner in the pouring rain  Try so hard to say goodbye	0

We recorded it analogue to tape in the wonderful AGM studio. So nice to work with Christoffer there it was two wonderful days. Thanks Hannes\, Charlie\, Lefvande Bilder and Christoffer for all this! / Wintergatan  About the occasion: The Swedish charity magazine Faktum asked several artists to record a song each for the compilation album "Det ordnar sig" meaning "it will be OK" in english. Wintergatan was asked to record Visa Från Utanmyra\, a swedish folksong made famous by late swedish piano player Jan Johansson. Don´t miss out on listening to his wonderful version of the song\, we wanted to capture that same feeling without doing it in the exact same way. The album is being sold by Faktum street sellers in Gothenburg and Malmö.  If you want to support what we do:  If you want to support: The fact that you are watching the videos and care about the music and future of Wintergatan is the best support anyone can have\, I want to thank everyone who is here for that kind of support\, it is really the fuel for the Wintergatan Engine.  Why do we accept support in this way? I\, Martin\, can already sustain myself 100% doing what I love to do. If you want to support artists/organisations who have not yet reached that privileged position\, please consider supporting other artists/organisations who need the support more. With that said\, I have too many ideas and too little time and with your support I can get more help from people around me to execute the ideas better and bring them out in the world faster.

In most English versions of the song the basic story is that of a condemned maiden pleading for someone to buy her freedom from the executioner. It is thought the versions collected by Mr. Child were incomplete and that the most extensive complete version is a story and not a song at all. A fairy story called "The Golden Ball" The following link lead to the story and you can compare for yourself.  http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/eng/meft/meft04.htm  This is Lead Belly's rendition.

Was the singer for several different bands in the 1920s\, including the Colonial Club Orchestra and The Regents Club Orchestra. He disappeared from public view in 1934 when he was laid off from work in the record industry as an executive and then genuinely disappeared for good\, because no one knows what happened to him after that.

The track was a no. 1 hit in the UK Singles Chart for three weeks in May 1979\, but despite this was not released as a single in the United States.  Song information  The song was written by Chris Stein and was the fourth single to be taken from the album\, Parallel Lines\, in the UK and most other parts of the world. The single had an unusual release in Australia\, with some dispute among fans as to whether it reached no. 1 there or failed to chart. This is because of its initial release as the lead single from Parallel Lines\, due to its being reminiscent of "In The Flesh"\, Blondie's first hit in Australia. "Sunday Girl" failed to chart\, however\, and was later re-released as a double A-side with "Heart of Glass"\, on the back of its UK success. As a result\, it was eclipsed by the disco track\, and is rarely recognised as having charted in its own right.  A French-language version of the track was released in the UK on the "Sunday Girl" 12" single; in France and the Netherlands\, it was the B-side of the 7". It also appears on the cassette release of Eat to the Beat. For Blondie's first greatest hits album The Best of Blondie in 1981\, producer Mike Chapman created a special mix which incorporated one verse sung in French. The bilingual version appears on the 2002 compilation Greatest Hits.  In 2010 a remake of this song was made by the English performer Florrie. It had slightly different lyrics and was used for a Nina Ricci perfume commercial. The song was covered in 2013 by the band She & Him on the album Volume 3.  In 2013 Blondie themselves re-recorded the song and offered it to be included in the CBGB's film soundtrack. This version was included on their 2014 compilation album Greatest Hits Deluxe Redux. The compilation was part of a 2-disc set called Blondie 4(0) Ever which included their 10th studio album Ghosts of Download and marked the 40th anniversary of the forming of the band.

COL title VAL Some Velvet Morning COL performer VAL Gabor Szabo	COL video title VAL Nancy Sinatra & Lee Hazlewood: Some Velvet Morning COL channel name VAL calicomoonchild COL description VAL The second song I ever really loved.   I have loved & lived with this song all my life and it is one of my favourite top 10 tracks of all time.   Track Meaning:  One day when the male character in the song is sober and has his head "straight"\, he will impart something of significance to his current love about his earliest & deepest love\, a woman named "pheadra" whose memory he is still haunted by.  Hence the repetition of the Pheadra/ Nancy portion of the song . . .  her section symbolising the "haunting" and struggle inside his head as he tries to gain "closure" from this past relationship with a mysterious former love Pheadra . . . his part of the song being directed to his new lover in the present.    His present lack of sobriety (drunkeness) describing his vain attempts to drown out the all consuming memory of this mysterious former love\, a memory that he is aware is annoying his present lover and describes his fear that she may leave him as a result of his "haunting" by his old (first)love.  Note:  At the point in history this song was written the labels of "straight" (meaning hetrosexual) and "gay" (meaning homosexual) did not yet exist.  In fact by the late sixties the term "gay" was just another word for "happy".	1

The song has been covered many times. Cliff's version was informed by the version from Jerry Butler and Betty Everett according to the sleeve.  This track is from the 1965 album\, "Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers" which was released on EMI. Unlike virtually all other Brit R&B bands of the sixties\, with the exception of Georgie Fame's Blue Flames\, Cliff & the Rebel Rousers had a predominantly sax based sound.  This was their first album. It's tight sound shows the benefit of years slogging it out on the road. There's also a more imaginative selection of material than heard from some of their peers.  It was produced by John Burgess  The musicians were:  Dave Wendells - Lead Guitar Bobby Thomson - Bass Maurice Groves - Sax Sid Phillips - Sax Roy Young - Piano\, Organ Mick Burt - Drums	0

(Brown's Sex Machine double album\, also released in 1970\, contains a different\, 11-minute-long performance of the song rather than the version released as a single.)  "Sex Machine" was one of the first songs Brown recorded with his new band\, The J.B.'s. In comparison with his 1960s funk hits such as "Papa's Got A Brand New Bag" and "Cold Sweat"\, it is notable for the de-emphasis of the horn section. Instead\, the song centers on the insistent riff played by brothers Bootsy and Catfish Collins on bass and guitar and Jabo Starks on drums\, along with the call and response interplay between Brown and Bobby Byrd's vocals.  The original single version of "Sex Machine" begins with a brief spoken dialogue between Brown and the members of his band\, which was recreated (with minor variations) in live performances: Fellas\, I'm ready to get up and do my thing! (Yeah! That's right! Do it!) I want to get into it\, man\, you know? (Go ahead! Yeah!) Like a\, like a sex machine\, man\, (Yeah!) movin'\, doin' it\, y'know? (Yeah!) Can I count it off? (Okay! Alright!) One\, two\, three\, four!  The song's freeform lyrics consist mostly of Brown's exhortations to "Get up / stay on the scene / like a sex machine" along with Byrd's regular shouts of "Get on up." The piece is harmonically static\, aside from a move to the subdominant on the bridge.  In 2004\, "Sex Machine" was ranked number 326 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest songs of all time.  Other versions  Brown recorded a reworking of the original song for his 1975 album Sex Machine Today.  The Flying Lizards recorded a successful cover of "Sex Machine" in 1984 which appeared on their album Top Ten.  In 1986 the Japanese musician Haruomi Hosono and his band F.O.E. recorded vocal and instrumental cover versions of "Sex Machine" for the album F.O.E. #1: Sex\, Energy and Star. The instrumental version featured a guest solo by Brown's longtime saxophonist Maceo Parker.  German comedian and jazz musician Helge Schneider recorded a comedic version of the song for his 1995 album Es rappelt im Karton. It was also released as a single with an accompanying video that features Schneider walking around a metro station making faces.  The rock band Widespread Panic covered the song on their 2004 live album Jackassolantern.  Jazz fusion/Blues guitarist Larry Coryell covered the song on his album Electric.  Sampling  Sy Smith and her back-up singer LeJon Walker sampled the song during their performance of "Think (About It)"\, which is featured on her DVD Sy Smith Live: Worship at the Temple.  Appearances in other media  "Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine" has appeared in a number of feature films\, including City of God\, Twisted\, Legally Blonde\, Lock\, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\, Friday and The Tuxedo (in which it is performed by Jackie Chan). It has also been used in an episode of the television sitcom Scrubs and in commercials for the Renault Clio and Tassimo. The song was featured on the Pontiac commercial.  The song figures prominently in the 2003 Japanese film Get Up!\, a comedy about a James Brown-obsessed yakuza gangster. The film's title (which transliterates into Japanese as Geroppa!) is taken from the song's lyrics.  British satirical puppet show Spitting Image ended an episode with an opera-style cover of the song\, starring Luciano Pavarotti.  Part 1 of "Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine" is available as downloadable content for the Rock Band series of video games.	0

COL title VAL Caledonia COL performer VAL Amy MacDonald	COL video title VAL Hoagy Carmichael - Little Old Lady COL channel name VAL 2ndviolinist COL description VAL From www.hoagy.com  Hoagland Howard Carmichael was born in 1899 in Bloomington. His father was an itinerant laborer who moved his family throughout the Midwest looking for steady work\, always returning to Indiana. "Home" was back in Bloomington\, where they'd left his wife Lida's golden oak piano. She helped support the family by playing at the local movie house and for university dances. "Ragtime was my lullaby\," Hoagy said\, and though his mother was thrilled when he picked out a tune on the golden oak\, she warned him: "Music is fun\, Hoagland\, but it don't buy you cornpone."  Lida Carmichael thought her son might grow up to be president of a railroad. He might have\, too\, because ambition burned hot in him\, but in 1919 he heard Louie Jordan's band (not to be confused with Louis Jordan who had a popular band in the thirties) in Indianapolis and this black ensemble of early jazz players "exploded in me almost more music than I could consume." Hoagy went on to study law at Indiana University but he was already a "jazz maniac" and his own band\, The Carmichael Syringe Orchestra\, was made up of a gang of loose cannons whose spiritual leader was a Dada-inspired poet named Monk. "There are other things in this world besides hot music\," Monk advised Hoagy in a serious moment\, "I forget what they are--but they're around." Those 'other things' were named Dorothy Kelly\, and to Hoagy she was more than first love. Dorothy was a secure respectable life in one of those big houses up on the hill in Bloomington he'd dreamt of as a boy\, and when he held her in his arms\, that was what he wanted more than anything else.  Then Hoagy heard a young white cornetist named Bix Beiderbecke and\, "it threw my judgment out of kilter." This was a sound like nothing he'd heard before and when Hoagy played an improvised tune for Bix\, the strange young man with a magical horn said\, "Whyn't you write music\, Hoagy?" The rest of his life was the answer to Bix's question.  Many years later\, when an audience saw the mature Hoagy sitting at the piano singing "Lazybones" or "Ole Buttermilk Sky" in what he called his 'native wood-note and flatsy- through-the-nose voice\,' it looked so natural and relaxed that it was easy to assume he'd led a charmed life. But Hoagy's road to success was just as bumpy and lurching as his friend Bix's was smooth and quick.After a modest but deceptive early success with "Washboard Blues" and "Riverboat Shuffle\," Hoagy packed a bag and went to New York. But he soon found himself scuffling around the cold\, lonely town\, not selling anything but bonds in a bottom-end job at a Wall St. brokerage house. "I'm singing the music publisher's theme song-it ain't a commercial\," he wrote back to Monk. He tried to give up--more than once--but the words of another old friend kept him going. Reggie Duval\, a black barber and dance hall pianist in Indianapolis\, was the only teacher Hoagy ever had besides his mother. Reggie had taught Hoagy how to make music 'jump' and also gave him a creed to live by: "Never play anything that don't sound right. You might not make any money--but at least you won't get hostile with yourself."  Hoagy kept writing what sounded 'right' and in 1930 made recordings of "Georgia On My Mind\," "Rockin' Chair\," and "Lazy River." Other artists heard the new songs and within a year Louis Armstrong\, Duke Ellington and the Dorsey brothers had recorded their own versions and were performing them on the new hot medium\, radio. Hoagy Carmichael himself was still barely known to the public\, but they were hearing and singing his songs\, and in 1936 Hoagy went to Hollywood where "the rainbow hits the ground for composers."  During the next decade\, Hoagy moved from backstage into the spotlight. He worked with lyricists Johnny Mercer\, Frank Loesser and Mitchell Parish. He became a star performer on records\, radio and stage with a signature style\, and began appearing in movies\, most memorably in "To Have and Have Not" and "The Best Years of Our Lives". He got married and fathered two sons. In one year\, 1946\, he had three of the top four songs on the Hit Parade\, and in 1951 he and Mercer won an Oscar for "In the Cool\, Cool\, Cool of the Evening." He hosted his own television show\, "The Saturday Night Review."  'Hoagy' was no longer a peculiar name\, he was a star\, even an American icon. He was also someone you knew\, a guy you wished you could have a drink and share a laugh with. He had the same joys and desires\, disappointments and fears you had\, and some of his songs--"Lazy River\," "Heart and Soul"-- became so familiar they sounded as if no one had written them\, they'd just always been there.	0

COL title VAL One COL performer VAL Apocalyptica	COL video title VAL Bob Wills & His Texas Playboys - Yearning Just for You (1938) COL channel name VAL ASACurator COL description VAL Bob Wills was the driving force behind Western Swing\, a form of Country & Western that fuses Jazz\, Hillbilly\, Blues\, Big Band Swing\, and many more rhythm forms together creating a  truly Unique\, Diverse and Unforgettable sound. Wills' shrewd mix of horns\, fiddles and steel guitar made for a swinging sound that grabbed the public's ear during the mid 1930s and 1940s. Bob Wills was born into a family of fiddlers on March 6\, 1905. His father\, John Wills  regularly won Texas fiddling competitions. Bob learned how to play fiddle and mandolin from his father. As a young man\, Wills performed at house dances\, medicine shows and in 1929 made his debut on the radio.  With commercial sponsorship\, Wills' bands performed on radio in the early 1930s as "Aladdin's Laddies" (for the Aladdin Lamp Co.) and "The Light Crust Doughboys" (for Light Crust Flour). Following a salary dispute\, Wills renamed his band the Texas Playboys and relocated to Tulsa\, Oklahoma\, where he had a live radio show. This exposure led to a contract with the American Recording Corporation - later absorbed into Columbia Records. In September 1935\, Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys recorded their first songs in a makeshift  recording studio in an old Dallas Warehouse. From that point on\, The Texas Playboys became an overnight sensation and recorded prolifically and made such classics as "Steel Guitar Rag"\, "Maiden's Prayer"\, "Take Me Back to Tulsa" and Wills' signature song\, "San Antonio Rose".  Their biggest hit\, was "New Spanish Two Step"\, which topped the country charts for 16 weeks in 1946. The Texas Playboys always had fine singers like Tommy Duncan and Leon McAuliffe\, and Wills punctuated the tunes with jive talking\, falsetto asides and cries of "Ah-ha!" He'd call out soloists by name and instrument\, good-naturedly goading them on to rollicking solo performances. In terms of personnel\, The Texas Playboys expanded and contracted over the years\, according to Wills' desires and the whims of the market. At one point the Texas Playboys were 22 pieces strong\, although the band more typically numbered between 9 and 18 members. There were personnel changes and musical shifts as Wills struggled to adapt to the changing face of  America in the postwar era. Nonetheless\, there was always a solid core of loyal regulars in The Texas Playboys. After leaving Columbia in 1947\, Wills continued to record prolifically for such labels as MGM\, Decca\, Longhorn and Kapp. The group also toured the country and often performed  at a Wills-owned dancehall in Sacramento\, California. In 1968\, Wills was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. A year later\, he suffered a debilitating stroke. There were reunions and recording sessions with many of the old Texas Playboys in 1971 and 1973. Wills' final stroke came in his sleep following the first day of a recording session in December 1973 that resulted in the double album "For the Last Time". Confined to a wheelchair\, he'd reprised his role as bandleader that day with a group of musicians that included former Texas Playboys. He never regained consciousness and died 18 months later on May 13\, 1975. Wills has been revered by such country-music legends as Waylon Jennings\, Willie Nelson\, George Straight\, and Merle Haggard who made a 1976 remake of Bob's 1941 hit "Cherokee Maiden". The contemporary Western Swing group\, Asleep at the Wheel has also cut a pair of tribute albums that have kept Wills' name before the public. Every year\, Bob Wills Day is celebrated on the last Saturday in April in Turkey\, Texas.	0

COL title VAL Man Gave Names to All the Animals COL performer VAL Townes Van Zandt	COL video title VAL IRENE REID I wonder where our love has gone (1965) COL channel name VAL OubaelPhoumet COL description VAL album : Room for one more.  Room for One More pairs singer Irene Reid with arranger Oliver Nelson and a sprawling who's who of session players including Thad Jones\, Charlie Mariano\, Kenny Burrell\, Phil Woods\, and J.J. Johnson. The title's more than a bit tongue in cheek\, of course\, but given the stature of her collaborators\, Reid no doubt felt some pressure to prove herself worthy of occupying the same studio space\, let alone to claim top billing\, but she does so admirably\, rendering classics like "Save Your Love for Me" and "I Wonder Where Our Love Has Gone" with extraordinary emotional potency. Although best suited for ballads\, most notably a breathtaking reading of "Who Can I Turn To?\," Reid is such a nimble stylist that even a throwaway number like the Bewitched theme still makes its mark. Nelson's spacious arrangements are sublime\, and it almost goes without saying that the band is exemplary. In short\, a wonderful if little-known LP in desperate need of reissue.	0

COL title VAL What'cha Gonna Do About It COL performer VAL Doris Troy	COL video title VAL Hall & Oates - Everyday Will Be Like A Holiday COL channel name VAL thatMimosaGrove COL description VAL 4th track from "Home For Christmas" (2006). The grammarian in me wants to change the spelling from "Everyday" to "Every Day." But who cares\, right? All that really matters is that the biggest-selling duo in Yacht Rock history has made a Christmas album!  On this track\, Hall and Oates cover William Bell and Booker T. Jones' classic R&B tune\, retaining not only the original spelling of the title but the warm vibe as well. But while the original song doesn't actually mention Christmas by name\, in typical Daryl Hall fashion\, the lyrics have been altered slightly and now leave no doubt about the holiday in question. In addition\, the duo gives this song—like all the others on the album—a smooth\, slick veneer that's nevertheless earthy\, friendly\, and comforting.   "Every day will be like a holiday / When my baby\, when my baby comes home Here she comes / I think I see her right now..."  They've really got my believing it!   ~thatMimosaGrove  P.S. – I plan to upload\, if not all\, at least a few more songs from this excellent album (which\, btw\, is weighted on the side of the sacred and reverential—a definite plus in my book). I started with this particular song because I couldn't find the album version on YouTube.

We recorded it analogue to tape in the wonderful AGM studio. So nice to work with Christoffer there it was two wonderful days. Thanks Hannes\, Charlie\, Lefvande Bilder and Christoffer for all this! / Wintergatan  About the occasion: The Swedish charity magazine Faktum asked several artists to record a song each for the compilation album "Det ordnar sig" meaning "it will be OK" in english. Wintergatan was asked to record Visa Från Utanmyra\, a swedish folksong made famous by late swedish piano player Jan Johansson. Don´t miss out on listening to his wonderful version of the song\, we wanted to capture that same feeling without doing it in the exact same way. The album is being sold by Faktum street sellers in Gothenburg and Malmö.  If you want to support what we do:  If you want to support: The fact that you are watching the videos and care about the music and future of Wintergatan is the best support anyone can have\, I want to thank everyone who is here for that kind of support\, it is really the fuel for the Wintergatan Engine.  Why do we accept support in this way? I\, Martin\, can already sustain myself 100% doing what I love to do. If you want to support artists/organisations who have not yet reached that privileged position\, please consider supporting other artists/organisations who need the support more. With that said\, I have too many ideas and too little time and with your support I can get more help from people around me to execute the ideas better and bring them out in the world faster.

"Ken" Griffin (December 28\, 1909 – March 11\, 1956) was an American organist. Griffin was born in Columbia\, Missouri. His biggest hit was "You Can't Be True\, Dear" (1948)\, which was first released as an instrumental\, and later that year re-released with a vocal by Jerry Wayne dubbed in. Both versions became popular\, selling over 3.5 million copies. He also starred in a 1954-55 syndicated television series\, 67 Melody Lane. He recorded on a variety of record labels including Columbia and Rondo. It was in the 1940s in Aurora\, Illinois that Griffin broke into the nightclub circuit\, playing at the Rivoli Cafe nightly. The sessions at the Rivoli cafe were broadcast on the radio station\, WMRO\, and the program became popular. Griffin died on March 11\, 1956 in Chicago\, Illinois at the age of 46\, of a heart attack and was buried at Lincoln Memorial Park in Aurora. Columbia had many hours of Griffin's unreleased recordings on tape\, and continued to release "new" recordings of Griffin's music for a number of years after his death.

COL title VAL Some Velvet Morning COL performer VAL Firewater	COL video title VAL Nancy Sinatra & Lee Hazlewood: Some Velvet Morning COL channel name VAL calicomoonchild COL description VAL The second song I ever really loved.   I have loved & lived with this song all my life and it is one of my favourite top 10 tracks of all time.   Track Meaning:  One day when the male character in the song is sober and has his head "straight"\, he will impart something of significance to his current love about his earliest & deepest love\, a woman named "pheadra" whose memory he is still haunted by.  Hence the repetition of the Pheadra/ Nancy portion of the song . . .  her section symbolising the "haunting" and struggle inside his head as he tries to gain "closure" from this past relationship with a mysterious former love Pheadra . . . his part of the song being directed to his new lover in the present.    His present lack of sobriety (drunkeness) describing his vain attempts to drown out the all consuming memory of this mysterious former love\, a memory that he is aware is annoying his present lover and describes his fear that she may leave him as a result of his "haunting" by his old (first)love.  Note:  At the point in history this song was written the labels of "straight" (meaning hetrosexual) and "gay" (meaning homosexual) did not yet exist.  In fact by the late sixties the term "gay" was just another word for "happy".	1

COL title VAL Amazed COL performer VAL Scotty McCreery	COL video title VAL ALBERT HAMMOND - When you tell me that you love me -Class Master- -demo unplugged- COL channel name VAL Jose Luis Montecristo COL description VAL Sir Albert Hammond (nombrado Oficial de Honor de la Orden del Imperio Británico por la Reina Isabel II de Inglaterra por su aportación al mundo de la música) ha vendido más de 360 millones de discos en todo el mundo con sus canciones\, interpretadas por él mismo y por otros grandes artistas de la talla de Julio Iglesias\, Willie Nelson\, Whitney Houston\, Diana Ross\, Luz Casal\, Starhip... Las canciones de Albert Hammond han liderado las listas de éxitos internacionales tanto de pop como de R&B\, country\, de estilo "adult contemporary" y de música latina\, con frecuencia de manera simultánea. Entre esas canciones se incluyen conocidos números 1 como "When I Need You"\, "Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now" (nominada a los Oscar®\, los Globos de Oro y los Grammy)\, "One Moment in Time" y "To All the Girls I've Loved Before". Auténticos himnos musicales como "One Moment in  Time"\, una canción que compuso para que se convirtiera en el tema oficial de los Juegos Olímpicos en 1988 y que llevó a Albert a recibir su primer Emmy\, y "Cantaré\, Cantarás" (el equivalente en el mercado de música en español del clásico "We Are the World")\, un tema que Albert co-escribió y produjo\, son dos ejemplos de la capacidad de Albert Hammond para componer canciones que se instalan desde el principio en el inconsciente colectivo de millones de personas.  Albert es un experto colaborador con un gran talento con la guitarra\, el piano y la interpretación vocal\, y ha formado  parte de algunos de los equipos de compositores con mayor éxito en la industria discográfica. Junto a su colega en labores de composición Mike Hazlewood\, con el que ha trabajado durante muchos años\, ha co-escrito muchos de sus éxitos\, entre ellos el clásico "The Air that I Breathe". Además\, Albert ha co-escrito grandes temas de éxito junto a Diane Warren\, entre ellos el famoso "I Don't Wanna Live Without Your Love" de Chicago\, "Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now" de Starship\, "Careless Heart" de Roy Orbison\, "Don't You Love Me Anymore" de Joe Cocker y "Don't Turn Around"\, una canción que ha alcanzado el éxito en tres ocasiones en las voces de Ace of Base\, Neil Diamond y el grupo Aswad. Asimismo\, Albert también ha compuesto  diversos éxitos junto a Hal David ("99 Miles from L.A." y "To All the Girls I've Loved Before") y John Bettis ("One Moment  in Time"\, "When You Tell Me That You Love Me" y "I Need To Be In Love"\, el gran éxito que popularizó el grupo The  Carpenters).  Entre las estrellas que han grabado canciones compuestas por Albert Hammond se encuentran muchos de los artistas más importantes del panorama musical contemporáneo\, incluyendo a Celine Dion\, Whitney Houston\, Aretha Franklin\, Tina Turner\, Elton John\, Joe Cocker\, Diana Ross\, Johnny Cash\, K.D. Lang\, Julio Iglesias y Josh Groban\, entre otros grandes nombres.  En 2008 Albert recibió la invitación para incorporarse al prestigioso Songwriter's Hall of Fame\, y también ha recibido la Orden del Imperio Británico (OBE) de manos de Su Majestad la Reina Isabel II de Inglaterra. Gibraltar\, la ciudad donde creció\, ofrecerá próximamente un homenaje a Albert Hammond a través de la edición de una serie de sellos postales conmemorativos que incluirán su imagen y destacarán asimismo sus mayores éxitos internacionales.	0

COL title VAL Axel F. COL performer VAL Harold Faltermeyer	COL video title VAL Maddox Brothers & Rose - No Help Wanted COL channel name VAL HillbillyBoogie1 COL description VAL The Maddox Brothers and Rose\, known as America's Most Colorful Hillbilly Band from the 1930s to the 1950s\, consisted of four brothers\, Fred\, Cal\, Cliff and Don Maddox\, along with their sister Rose. Cliff died in 1949 and was replaced by brother Henry. The group disbanded in 1956.  The family hailed from Boaz\, Alabama\, but rode the rails and hitch hiked to California in 1933 when the band members were still children\, following the failed efforts of their sharecropper parents during the early part of the Depression. They were a little in advance of the flood of Okies who were to flood the state in the 30s. They struggled to make a living as intinerant fruit and vegetable pickers following the harvest as far north as Washington state\, and as far east as Arizona\, as well as in the San Joaquin Valley. They often worked from dawn to dusk\, sleeping and eating on the ground.  Having settled in Modesto\, the family developed their musical ability and\, in 1937 performed on the radio\, sponsored by a local furniture store. In 1939 they entered a hillbilly band competition at the centenial Sacramento State Fair after driving to Sacramento in their Model A. When they took the stage they tore through "Sally Let Your Bangs Hang Down" with rocking rhythms and risque lyrics. They became\, officially\, California's best hillbilly band.  The brothers and Rose appeared at places such as the 97th Street Corral in Los Angles.  From 1946-1951 the group recorded for 4 Star Records (Hollywood)\, then for Columbia Records. Some 4 Star masters were leased and released by US.-Decca Records at the beginning of the 1950s. The following quotes are from Rose Maddox. "We were called hillbilly singers - not country - then. No\, none of this country music then. People just called us hillbilly... People tell me that I was one of the first women to sing what I sang - country boogie. I guess I was. There was no rock 'n' roll in those early days\, before 1955. Only country boogie. My brothers also played that way. We called it country then.  The Maddox's material ranged from the country standards of Hank Williams and Merle Travis\, cowboy songs\, to the Western swing of Bob Wills\, to old-time\, folk\, and church singing\, to jazz\, swing\, boogie woogie and even a taste of early rock and roll.  Fred Maddox played upright bass using the "slap bass" technique as early as 1937.[5] This trademark backbeat\, a slapping bass style\, helped drive a broad change in popular music\, sporting a faster\, immediately discernible rhythm that came to be known as rockabilly.  Fred Maddox's bass is displayed at the Experience Music Project in Seattle. "They wanted his bass because they believe he might have hit the first note of rock 'n' roll on it.	0

Squee~  I love this song so so so so so so so so much. And very few people seem to know about it\, so I thought I'd make this.  If the lyrics sound familiar\, it's because this is actually a partial cover (?) to Head Like A Hole by Nine Inch Nails. The melody is different.  I modified the lyrics for this video from http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/2508/ and the beautiful picture is from http://snakeplaya24.deviantart.com/art/space-67540954. The font used is Little Sparrow. Hope you enjoy this! ♥  P.S. Forgot to mention\, this video is heavily inspired by Platypiz/ Platypizz/ Platypiz1/ Platypiz2/ any other incarnations this person may have.

COL title VAL Ma vie COL performer VAL Alain Barrière	COL video title VAL PETER PAUL AND MARY CD Vintage Folk. If I Had A hammer \, 500 Miles \, Lemon Tree COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Peter\, Paul and Mary (también llamado PP&M) fue uno de los grupos musicales estadounidenses de música folk más exitosos de la década de 1960. Estaba compuesto por Peter Yarrow\, Paul Stookey y Mary Travers.  En 1962 iniciaron su carrera musical con su primer disco llamado Peter\,Paul & Mary. En las décadas anteriores de los 60s la música folk fue identificada por artistas como Woody Guthrie o Pete Seeger.Cuando Peter\, Paul y Mary llegaron a la escena\, para la mayoría de América\, folk era visto sólo como una barra lateral a la música pop que empleó instrumentos acústicos.  En esta coyuntura histórica crítica\, con el país todavía se está recuperando de la era de McCarthy\, el Movimiento de los Derechos Civiles a tomar forma\, la guerra fría y calentar un espíritu naciente de activismo en el aire; Peter Yarrow\, Noel Stookey (Paul) y Mary Travers vino junto a yuxtaponer estas corrientes cruzadas y así recuperar la potencia popular como fuerza social\, cultural y político. Pero pocos a la vez podría haber dado cuenta de lo penetrante fervor y el mensaje del grupo de la humanidad\, la esperanza y activismo se abrazaron.  Tener su música asociada con causas y soluciones es tan natural como respirar para Peter\, Paul y Mary. La música y la acción que genera son igualmente importantes para ellos y están en el corazón de su historia. Más recientemente\, sus esfuerzos individuales y colectivos se han centrado en temas tan cruciales como la violencia armada contra los niños\, los derechos de las y los esfuerzos de organización de los recolectores de fresas en California\, la indigencia y el hambre mundial.  Ningún grupo folk americano ha durado más o acumulado muchos seguidores más leales que Peter\, Paul and Mary\, de hecho\, algunos grupos de cualquier género han registrado más años (45) o millas (incontables) gira en directo\, anualmente\, la difusión del mensaje y la participación los siguientes (ahora cuatro) generaciones. Durante su carrera legendaria\, el trío ganó cinco premios Grammy\, produjo 13 Top 40 hits\, 6 de las cuales subió a los Top 10 - así como ocho de oro y cinco discos de platino. Eso PP & M alcanzado tal nivel enrarecido de éxito comercial sin compromiso y sin dejar una tradición centenaria de las personas que levantan sus voces en una canción por el bien de la libertad\, es simplemente una prueba más de su extraordinariamente exitosa carrera tanto una misión cumplida como una carrera musical.

Sjømannsvise har blitt en av Cranners mest folkekjære viser\, og den har kommet på flere plateinnspillinger siden.   Den svenske trubaduren Cornelis Vreeswijk lagde en egen tekstversjon av Sjømannsvise som han kalt Ågren.   Han oppgav opprinnelig melodien som «norsk folketone»\, men førte opp Cranner som komponist da han gav ut visa på plata Poem\, ballader och lite blues i 1970.  En sjømannsvise er en vise om sjømenn og livet ombord\, eller en vise som er populær blant sjømenn.   Sjømannsviser kan deles i to grupper. Sjantier som var arbeidssangen ombord på seilskutene og frivaktsviser som var populære sanger blant sjømenn.	0

Some day you'll return to  Your valleys and your farms  And you'll no longer burn  To be brothers in arms.    Through these fields of destruction  Baptism of fire  I've witnessed your suffering  As the battle raged higher.  And though they did hurt me so bad  In my fear and alarm  You did not desert me  My brothers in arms.    There's so many different worlds  So many different suns  And we have just one world  But we live in different ones.    Now the sun's gone to hell  And the moon's riding high  Let me bid you farewell  Every man has to die.  But it's written in the starlight  And every line in your palm  We're fools to make war  On our brothers in arms...	0

The song has been covered many times. Cliff's version was informed by the version from Jerry Butler and Betty Everett according to the sleeve.  This track is from the 1965 album\, "Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers" which was released on EMI. Unlike virtually all other Brit R&B bands of the sixties\, with the exception of Georgie Fame's Blue Flames\, Cliff & the Rebel Rousers had a predominantly sax based sound.  This was their first album. It's tight sound shows the benefit of years slogging it out on the road. There's also a more imaginative selection of material than heard from some of their peers.  It was produced by John Burgess  The musicians were:  Dave Wendells - Lead Guitar Bobby Thomson - Bass Maurice Groves - Sax Sid Phillips - Sax Roy Young - Piano\, Organ Mick Burt - Drums	0

COL title VAL The Man with the Golden Gun COL performer VAL Emilíana Torrini	COL video title VAL Betty Johnson -- I Need You Now (VintageMusic.es) COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Betty Johnson 16 de marzo 1929 (otras fuentes dicen 1931)  es una cantante norteamericana que alcanzó su pico de carrera en la década de 1950. Cuando era adolescente\, fue contratada por Columbia Records e hizo algunas grabaciones\, ninguna de las cuales tuvieron éxito. En 1951\, Percy Faith \, que la había conocido por sus grabaciones de Columbia\, trató de convencer a Mitch Miller ( A & R\, el director de Columbia) para firmar con ella\, pero Miller\, que incluye Doris Day y Rosemary Clooney \, entre los artistas que habían firmado\, no veía la necesidad firmar con ella.  Johnson lanzó el álbum para niños\, con Eddy Arnold producido por Simon and Schuster \, que posteriormente la contrató para su propio sello discográfico\, Bell Records en 1954. En el mismo año firmó un contrato con Csida-Grean\, una sociedad de gestión que había manejado la carrera de Arnold. Charles Grean\, miembro  de esa compañía\,  produjo muchas de sus grabaciones posteriores. En 1955\, firmó un contrato con RCA Victor Records \, que la envió a Chicago\, Illinois .  En Chicago\, Johnson trabajó con Arnold de nuevo en su  serie\, Eddy Arnold Time\, respaldado por un grupo que había trabajado con su familia en el Grand Ole Opry\, The Jordanaires . Este grupo más tarde fue conocido como un grupo de apoyo de Elvis Presley .  En 1957 se casó con Grean\, aunque el matrimonio sólo duraría hasta 1961\, la relación profesional continuó. Luego fue contratada por Jack Paar para su programa de televisión\, Tonight . Esto condujo a un contrato discográfico con Atlantic Records en 1957\, para el que tuvo su próximo gran éxito\, "Little Blue Man".  Johnson continuó en Tonight hasta 1962 cuando Jack Paar fue reemplazado por Johnny Carson.

COL title VAL De Do Do Do\, De Da Da Da COL performer VAL The Police	COL video title VAL VOGUES   IT'S GETTING BETTER 1968 Reprise Records    RS 6314 COL channel name VAL Amnondoowop COL description VAL It's Getting Better is a song written by Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil that was a sunshine pop hit single in 1969 for Cass Elliot.  The song describes the singer's satisfaction with a love relationship that is down-to-earth rather than extravagantly romantic\, a subgenre of love song exemplified by the Jerome Kern/ P. G. Wodehouse composition "Bill". Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil had previously written the similarly themed "He's Sure the Boy I Love"\, a hit for the Crystals in 1963.  "It's Getting Better" was first recorded by the Vogues for inclusion on their Reprise album\, TURN AROUND\, LOOK AT ME\, which was released by August\, 1968. The next version was one by Leonard Nimoy for his Dot Records lp\, THE WAY I FEEL. That was by October\, 1968. It was by March\, 1969 when The Will-O-Bees\, a New York City based trio (Janet Blossom\, Steven Porter\, and Robert Merchanthouse) who recorded a number of Mann-Weil compositions\, also had a single release of "It's Getting Better" on the SGC label (Screen Gems Columbia). The Mama Cass version happened by May\, 1969\, initially as a single advance release and then an album cut\, the single release referencing the album.  1969 saw the release of several single versions of "It's Getting Better" but only Cass Elliot's was by an established artist\, the other versions being by Ronnie Buskirk\, Freddie Gelfand\, and P. K. Limited. [1]  "It's Getting Better" had been recorded by Cass Elliot for inclusion on her June 1969 album release Bubble Gum\, Lemonade\, and... Something for Mama\, which was produced by Steve Barri and arranged by Jimmie Haskell. The Wrecking Crew (James Burton on guitar\, Hal Blaine on drums\, Larry Knechtel on keyboards\, and Joe Osborn on bass) — who'd regularly backed the Mamas & the Papas — were among the instrumentalists on the album.  "It's Getting Better" was issued as the second advance single in May 1969 following the release that March of "Move in a Little Closer\, Baby"\, a single reminiscent of the Mamas & the Papas sound which reached a Billboard Hot 100 peak of #58. Steve Barri says that "Move in a Little Closer\, Baby" was "one [album track] [Elliot] wasn't too thrilled about...but she loved 'It's Getting Better'".[2]  A #13 Easy Listening hit\, "It's Getting Better" reached #30 on the Hot 100.[3] It remained on the U.S. charts for 18 weeks.[4] The single's regional success was staggered\, and it reached the Top Ten in several markets\, ranking as high as #2 in Minneapolis-Saint Paul and San Diego.[5] Its estimated U.S. sales were 500\,000 copies.[4]  "It's Getting Better" had a more pronounced chart impact in the UK\, reaching #8 in October 1969 and selling almost 100\,000 copies\, despite a potential rival version by Paul Jones. The single bested the UK chart performance of Elliot's signature song\, "Dream a Little Dream of Me" (#11)\, which had lost some popularity to a rival version by Anita Harris. [6] [4]  "Dream a Little Dream of Me" and "It's Getting Better" would be Elliot's only two UK chart appearances. In the U.S.\, "It's Getting Better" was the fourth of Elliot's seven solo Billboard Hot 100 appearances and her second Top 40 hit after "Dream a Little Dream of Me".  In Australia "It's Getting Better" by Cass Elliott charted at #53.  In the wake of the success of "It's Getting Better"\, Elliot's next two singles were recordings of Barry Mann-Cynthia Weil compositions: "Make Your Own Kind of Music" — which like "It's Getting Better" had been recorded by the Will-O-Bees in 1968 — and a new song\, "New World Coming". Although both songs are now considered soft rock classics\, their original chart success was fairly mild: "Make Your Own Kind of Music" peaked at #36 (Elliot's third and final solo Top 40 appearance)\, and "New World Coming" peaked at #42.[7]  "It's Getting Better" has also been recorded by Richard Barnes\, New Cactus Band\, Louise Morrissey\, the Popinjays\, Kevin Rowland and John & Anne Ryder. Bobby Rydell made it in 1976 for Born With a Smile\, his sole album released after 1964.[1][7] Jane McDonald's rendition of "It's Getting Better" can be heard on her 2010 concert album Live at the London Palladium. A Swedish rendering of "It's Getting Better" by lyricist Stig Anderson entitled "Det Känns Bara Bättre" was cut by Anna-Lena Löfgren in 1970.  In 2011 Cass Elliot's "It's Getting Better" was employed in a television advertisement for Nestea.	0

Composta da Francis Lai.  Con lo pseudonimo Bob Mitchell\, Augusto Martelli ne realizzò una versione inserendola come lato B del singolo "Un homme et une femme". Mina vocalizza tutta la parte melodica del brano anche se non compare nei crediti del disco. Scrive Antonio Bianchi sulla Fanzine 72 del Mina Fan Club "Quella versione\, tutta sospiri e intimità\, era stata additata dai giornalisti dell'epoca come un suggello della storia d'amore fra la cantante e il musicista". Digitalizzato per la prima volta nel CD "Mina Notre Etoile" (MBO\, 1999) che raccoglie le incisioni in lingua francese del periodo Italdisc (58-63).	0

COL title VAL Snap Your Fingers COL performer VAL Perry Danos	COL video title VAL You're Just In Love - Perry Como COL channel name VAL Maureen712 COL description VAL "You're Just in Love" is a popular song by Irving Berlin. It was published in 1950 and was first performed by Ethel Merman and Russell Nype in Call Me Madam\, a musical comedy that debuted at the Imperial Theatre in New York City on October 12 that year. The show ran for 644 performances. Ethel Merman also later starred in the 1953 film version. Theatre lore has it that Berlin wrote the song one night after Call Me Madam was not doing well in tryouts. The second act of the show was lacking. "What I'd like to do is a song with the kid (Russell Nype)\," Merman said. So\, Berlin went to his room and later produced the counterpoint song. When Berlin played the song for Merman\, she said "We'll never get off the stage." According to Berlin's biographer though\, Berlin played the song for Russell Nype first\, but admonished him not to admit he did so because it would infuriate Merman.  Several recorded versions made the charts in 1950-51: by Perry Como and The Fontane Sisters\, by Rosemary Clooney and Guy Mitchell\, and by Ethel Merman and Dick Haymes.  The Perry Como/Fontane Sisters version was recorded on September 26\, 1950 and released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number 20-3945. The record first reached the Billboard magazine charts on December 22\, 1950 and lasted 17 weeks on the chart\, peaking at #5.  The Rosemary Clooney/Guy Mitchell version was recorded on October 21\, 1950 and released by Columbia Records as catalog number 39052. The record first reached the Billboard magazine charts on February 23\, 1951 and lasted 2 weeks on the chart\, peaking at #29.  The Ethel Merman/Dick Haymes version was recorded on October 17\, 1950 and released by Decca Records as catalog number 27317. The record first reached the Billboard magazine charts on March 30\, 1951 and lasted 1 week on the chart\, at #30. Although the lowest charting of the three\, it got a considerable amount of airplay in subsequent years.  Musically\, the song is one of Irving Berlin's three well-known songs that use true counterpoint—a main melody with a secondary melody running at the same time\, both with independent lyrics - his two other best-known counterpoint songs are Play a Simple Melody and "An Old-Fashioned Wedding" (see the 1966 revival of "Annie Get Your Gun").	0

I'm back where I belong\, Back in baby's arms.  Don't know why we quarreled\, We never did before. Since we found out how it hurts\, I bet we never quarrel any more.   I'm back in baby's arms; How I missed those loving arms. I'm back where I belong\, Back in baby's arms.  Thought I didn't need his love\, 'Til he took it away. Now I'm back where I belong\, And in my baby's arms I'm gonna stay.  I'm back in baby's arms; How I missed those loving arms. I'm back where I belong\, Back in baby's arms.  Back in baby's arms. Back in baby's arms. Back in baby's arms.  Artist: Patsy Cline Album: The Patsy Cline Story Year: 1963 Song: Back In Baby's Arms	1

COL title VAL Out on the Western Plain COL performer VAL Rory Gallagher	COL video title VAL YVONNE ELLIMAN Hello Stranger COL channel name VAL daveinprogress3 COL description VAL Hawaiian beauty\, Yvonne Elliman\, was not on the pop landscape all that long\, but she made her impact\, and her gorgeous face and sweet but powerful vocals graced the 1970's with a distinctive air. I am posting "Hello Stranger"\, as it is not one of her bigger chart successes\, but it does showcase her wonderful voice and it is a very seventies take on the 60's Barbara Lewis classic.  35 years ago\, "Love me"\, written by the Bee Gees\, was a breakout hit for Yvonne\, giving her a worldwide hit\, including Australia\, where it would ascend the charts and reach #4 in the late summer of 1977. "Hello Stranger" was discovered by me\, once again courtesy of a Various Artist compile - the sexy styled "Ripper 77" with the curvaceous cheeks of a woman adorned with lipstick writing of the names of the 20 original artists featured on the record.  "Hello Stranger"\, like several of the hits on this compile\, was not a hit in Australia\, but three and a half decades later\, it is a fondly considered musical postcard from the era\, and i am eternally grateful to the record companies for releasing those compilations\, even if some of the inclusions were bizarre and obscure.  Back in the halcyon days of the late 1970's\, radio airplay and tv shows like "Countdown" and "Sounds Unlimited" were the few outlets for songs to receive exposure. So many fine recordings were simply overlooked\, because of the few opportunities for visibility or audibility at the time.   1978 would be the major year for Yvonne with another Gibb brothers extravaganza giving her the biggest success of her career with the #1 smash "If I can't have you"\, from  the pop & disco juggernaut "Saturday Night Fever". Another movie soundtrack "Moment by Moment" also starring John Travolta\, would see another recording by Yvonne Elliman - the title track\, but the gentle ballad could not break through the endless litany of disco hits that monopolised 1979. Her own "Love Pains" was her final hit from that part of her career\, and it is a much loved and much covered anthem from the disco era.  I hope "Hello Stranger" gives whoever hears it\, the joy that it has given me.	0

COL title VAL I Can't Go for That (No Can Do) COL performer VAL Retrocity	COL video title VAL Diane Ray - No Arms Can Ever Hold You (1964) COL channel name VAL Tom Smith COL description VAL One of the most adorable records ever\, and one of my favourite songs. Released on a single in March 1964. The other side\, "Tied Up With Mary" charted locally\, but not nationally. Diane's only nationally charting Billboard single was "Please Don't Talk to the Lifeguard" (#31 in September 1963). "No Arms Can Ever Hold You" was originally a hit in 1955\, charting at #23 Billboard Pop for Georgie Shaw\, #26 for Pat Boone and #67 for the Gaylords\, all around the same time. Later\, this song charted at #27 for the Bachelors on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1965 (#7 UK\, #3 Adult Contemporary) and #93 on the Hot 100 for Bobby Vinton in 1970 (#8 Adult Contemporary).  Arranged by Bill Justis.  Written by Art Crafer and Jimmy Nebb.	0

I don't want to go on a paragraph-long rant\, but why is Nat so neglected today? As to vocal talent and song interpretation\, he had it nailed down\, even covering stuff that wasn't country by any stretch. Anyhow\, a dose of Nat is a good way to end the week\, so enjoy!

(Brown's Sex Machine double album\, also released in 1970\, contains a different\, 11-minute-long performance of the song rather than the version released as a single.)  "Sex Machine" was one of the first songs Brown recorded with his new band\, The J.B.'s. In comparison with his 1960s funk hits such as "Papa's Got A Brand New Bag" and "Cold Sweat"\, it is notable for the de-emphasis of the horn section. Instead\, the song centers on the insistent riff played by brothers Bootsy and Catfish Collins on bass and guitar and Jabo Starks on drums\, along with the call and response interplay between Brown and Bobby Byrd's vocals.  The original single version of "Sex Machine" begins with a brief spoken dialogue between Brown and the members of his band\, which was recreated (with minor variations) in live performances: Fellas\, I'm ready to get up and do my thing! (Yeah! That's right! Do it!) I want to get into it\, man\, you know? (Go ahead! Yeah!) Like a\, like a sex machine\, man\, (Yeah!) movin'\, doin' it\, y'know? (Yeah!) Can I count it off? (Okay! Alright!) One\, two\, three\, four!  The song's freeform lyrics consist mostly of Brown's exhortations to "Get up / stay on the scene / like a sex machine" along with Byrd's regular shouts of "Get on up." The piece is harmonically static\, aside from a move to the subdominant on the bridge.  In 2004\, "Sex Machine" was ranked number 326 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest songs of all time.  Other versions  Brown recorded a reworking of the original song for his 1975 album Sex Machine Today.  The Flying Lizards recorded a successful cover of "Sex Machine" in 1984 which appeared on their album Top Ten.  In 1986 the Japanese musician Haruomi Hosono and his band F.O.E. recorded vocal and instrumental cover versions of "Sex Machine" for the album F.O.E. #1: Sex\, Energy and Star. The instrumental version featured a guest solo by Brown's longtime saxophonist Maceo Parker.  German comedian and jazz musician Helge Schneider recorded a comedic version of the song for his 1995 album Es rappelt im Karton. It was also released as a single with an accompanying video that features Schneider walking around a metro station making faces.  The rock band Widespread Panic covered the song on their 2004 live album Jackassolantern.  Jazz fusion/Blues guitarist Larry Coryell covered the song on his album Electric.  Sampling  Sy Smith and her back-up singer LeJon Walker sampled the song during their performance of "Think (About It)"\, which is featured on her DVD Sy Smith Live: Worship at the Temple.  Appearances in other media  "Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine" has appeared in a number of feature films\, including City of God\, Twisted\, Legally Blonde\, Lock\, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\, Friday and The Tuxedo (in which it is performed by Jackie Chan). It has also been used in an episode of the television sitcom Scrubs and in commercials for the Renault Clio and Tassimo. The song was featured on the Pontiac commercial.  The song figures prominently in the 2003 Japanese film Get Up!\, a comedy about a James Brown-obsessed yakuza gangster. The film's title (which transliterates into Japanese as Geroppa!) is taken from the song's lyrics.  British satirical puppet show Spitting Image ended an episode with an opera-style cover of the song\, starring Luciano Pavarotti.  Part 1 of "Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine" is available as downloadable content for the Rock Band series of video games.	1

Purchase from the label: http://www.paradiseofbachelors.com/shop/pob-21 Purchase from Bandcamp: https://paradiseofbachelors.bandcamp.com/album/ambsace Other options: http://lnk.to/PoB21  The second album of astonishing duets by guitarists James Elkington (who has toured and/or recorded with Jeff Tweedy\, Richard Thompson\, and Steve Gunn\, among others) and Nathan Salsburg (an accomplished soloist deemed by NPR “one of those names we’ll all associate with American folk guitar”) is a sublime suite of nimble\, filigreed compositions by two singular stylists. Belying its title—“ambsace” is the lowest throw of dice; snake eyes—the record thrives on a gentle empathy and generosity of spirit\, sitting sneakily protean original compositions alongside gorgeous arrangements of songs by Duke Ellington and The Smiths at the same big hand-hewn table.

COL title VAL The Secret of Life COL performer VAL Jacqui Dankworth	COL video title VAL Alf Cranner - Sjømannsvise - 1966 COL channel name VAL Cauldron20 COL description VAL Sjømannsvise av Harald Sverdrup ble tonesatt av visekunstneren Alf Cranner.   Visa ble presentert under turneen «Vers og viiiiiiser. Lyriske utskeielser ved Harald Sverdrup og Alf Cranner» i 1966\, og utgitt på LP året samme høst.   Sjømannsvise har blitt en av Cranners mest folkekjære viser\, og den har kommet på flere plateinnspillinger siden.   Den svenske trubaduren Cornelis Vreeswijk lagde en egen tekstversjon av Sjømannsvise som han kalt Ågren.   Han oppgav opprinnelig melodien som «norsk folketone»\, men førte opp Cranner som komponist da han gav ut visa på plata Poem\, ballader och lite blues i 1970.  En sjømannsvise er en vise om sjømenn og livet ombord\, eller en vise som er populær blant sjømenn.   Sjømannsviser kan deles i to grupper. Sjantier som var arbeidssangen ombord på seilskutene og frivaktsviser som var populære sanger blant sjømenn.	0

COL title VAL Love on the Rocks / Bennie and the Jets COL performer VAL Sara Bareilles	COL video title VAL Michel Legrand Orchestra I Will Say Goodbye featuring - Sarah Vaughan COL channel name VAL ifcopod COL description VAL Adding  to U Tube's embarrassment of riches  a  Legrand song and  version  already posted. A good Jack Jones take   but then did Jones do otherwise than good interpretations  .. What can you say about Sarah Vaughan apart from " the best" The dispute is less active but thirty plus  years ago   you could  get a conversation about who is the greatest jazz singer  or even what is a jazz singer. it encouraged many into print  with aspirants spreading themselves on the   quidditas of singing.  Louis  Armstrong for whom some flew a flag as greatest jazz  singer. may I respectfully dissent. The  big  three  for  me and  seemingly many ~ . Operatic voiced Sarah   Vaughan ~Virtuoso  scat  singer  but also excellent straight ballad singer  Ella Fitzgerald ~and for those with a yen for tragedy Billie Holiday.  but many many more  ~  some not getting respect deserved.Some skirting jazz~  a Raincheck ~ In the 1960s or a little later  I had an album by a singer since died but underlining the cross border nature of music from show tunes   to jazz.  singer  Carol Ventura . Nowadays  a name  sadly  for a pub quiz  but Ventura was a skilled singer especially remembered Everybody says Dont (musical Anyone can Whistle) and another number Bye Bye Just checked U Tube and its not there  so  quite a deal  of music still missing from internet  but lets pay tribute to 87 year old veteran jazz arranger  saxist  Benny Golson who scored Ventura's albums a talent in the vicinity of Quincy Jones.  I have some live Golson visuals from 1965( at least i hope I still jhave from  a  BBC session   featuring Tubby Hayes in the saxes.   The great thing the  aforementioned  female trio   Vaughan Fitzgerald Holiday don t clash ~ each with unique  vocal   attributes  True  Ella and Sarah   have similarities both possessed of phenomenal  vocal virtuosity  and quite obviously rejoicing in their    special vocal gifts.  and  that white heat art creativity   led to   prolific  legacies  A time when skill in musical art was paramount  in performance. something that nosedived or perhaps simply changed  as the years passed   but that's another story . Unlike the greats of yore  todays  pop music  depends   less on  interpretative skills. Although her voice was ragged  by that   time ( comparatively speaking   but always musical ) Ella late in her career did a live Basie Album  that still swings like billy~o.Ella's  1950s   1960s  songbooks  with voice in full loom  are   a treasure of popular music.  I know rockers and latterday musos want to protect their music as special but  another prejudice? For me the best  popular music   of 20th  century     starts and ends with George Gershwin Harold Arlen Cole Porter Richard Rodgers  and  other  mid century  songwriters   with  songs  marked   by many things not least versatility  in interpretation not just in a jazz way..  An attractive understated I Will say Goodbye   on  U Tube  from 1972  but then Lena Horne  could   easily  do  linear  understated  interpretations  amidst her blitzing  up tempos numbers. The arrangement seems Legrand and better for it.  Pity   Everybody says Dont  is less heard nowadays Barbra Streisand also had her  say on that show tune . Not one to say boo about Streisand and her vocal technique  but I probably prefer Ventura on the song. Theres a lot of  vocal  exertion in the Streisand version ~ Ifcopod thats what the song is about a sort of patter song going like the clappers .Nonetheless~(  IIfcopods desperate bid for credibility  as the ship sinks) ~I prefer the   more deliberate gait of Ventura  version.  But if there is an implicit agenda  to this  erudite spiel Consider the numerous( literally) singers who  like Ventura  just  got one stab at success. Luckily we have the CDs or more likely vinyls.   This has nothing to do with anything just wanted to share the thought. In the 1970s I had a great live Buddy Greco album  recorded in the UK  doing among other things   youve guessed it  his party piece  Thats why Thats  why  the  Lady is a Tramp. the album~ vinyl disappeared but not memories  of Buddy  swinging like crazy  doing what he did so well. A great version.	0

COL title VAL You're So Good to Me COL performer VAL Glenwood Region Music Group	COL video title VAL Bill Withers - Who Is He (And What Is He to You) COL channel name VAL Alf COL description VAL Bill Withers - Who Is He (And What Is He to You)  William Harrison "Bill" Withers\, Jr. (born July 4\, 1938) is an American singer-songwriter and musician who performed and recorded from 1970 until 1985. Some of his best-known songs are "Lean on Me"\, "Ain't No Sunshine"\, "Use Me"\, "Just the Two of Us"\, "Lovely Day"\, and "Grandma's Hands". His life was recently the subject of the documentary film Still Bill. Withers was born the youngest of thirteen children in the small coal-mining town of Slab Fork\, West Virginia. Raised in nearby Beckley\, West Virginia\, Withers was thirteen years old when his father died. He enlisted with the United States Navy at age eighteen and served for nine years\, during which time he became interested in singing and writing songs. Soon after his discharge from the Navy in 1970\, he relocated to Los Angeles for a musical career. Withers worked as an assembler for several different companies\, including Douglas Aircraft Corporation\, while recording demo tapes with his own money\, shopping them around and performing in clubs at night. When he debuted with the song "Ain't No Sunshine" he refused to resign his job because of his belief that the music business was a fickle industry and that he was still a novice compared to other acts.  Lyrics  A man we passed just tried to stare me down  And when I looked at you\, you looked at the ground  I don't know who he is but I think that you do   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   I have something in my heart and in your eyes  Tell me he's not someone just passin' by  And when you cleared your throat was that your cue   Dag gummit dag  Who is he and what is he to you   Now when I add the sum of you and me  I get confused and I keep coming up with three  You're too much for one man but not enough for two   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Hey you tell me man don't have not much for intuition  That what you really think or are you wishin'  Before you wreck your old home be certain of the new   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you	0

Joey DeFrancesco Composed: Sam Jones Cd: "Like That"\, Recording Date: August 30\, 1995 - August 31\, 1995  Release Date: April 30\, 1996   Subscribe Here: http://www.youtube.com/user/TheSouLighting http://www.facebook.com/thesoulighting  Jimmy Bruno\, born July 22\, 1953 in Philadelphia\, Pennsylvania\, is a master jazz guitarist and jazz educator. He started playing at the age of 7. He began his professional career at the age of 19\, touring with Buddy Rich. Among his many credits\, he is the only guitarist to have ever led Frank Sinatra's band. He played for many years in Los Angeles before returning to the Philadelphia area. He counts Johnny Smith\, Hank Garland\, Joe Pass\, Tal Farlow\, Wes Montgomery\, Howard Roberts\, Jim Hall\, and Pat Martino amongst his influences. In March\, 2011 Jimmy opened up Jimmy Bruno's Guitar Workshop\, a website that allows students to learn directly from Jimmy through video lessons.  For more information: http://jimmybruno.com/biography.php  Although Like That was recorded in New York\, many of the people involved with the project were Philadelphians. The pleasing hard bop date unites Jimmy Bruno's Philly-based trio of the 1990s (which includes bassist Craig Thomas and drummer Steve Holloway) with organist/trumpeter and Philly native Joey DeFrancesco\, Although DeFrancesco plays organ on most of the 11 songs\, he switches to the trumpet and favors a Miles Davis-influenced mute on relaxed versions of "There Is No Greater Love" and "Stars Fell on Alabama."   Ο Jimmy Bruno γεννήθηκε στις 22 Ιουλίου 1953\, στην Πενσυλβάνια και είναι ένας Αμερικανός master κιθαρίστας και διδάσκαλος της τζαζ. Παίζει από ηλικία 7 ετών και ξεκίνησε την επαγγελματική του καριέρα στην ηλικία των 19\, περιοδεύοντας με τον Buddy Rich. Μεταξύ των πολλών του διακρίσεων\, είναι ότι ήταν ο μόνος επικεφαλής κιθαρίστας της μπάντας του Frank Sinatra. Έπαιξε για πολλά χρόνια στο Λος Άντζελες πριν από την επιστροφή στην  Φιλαδέλφεια. Έχει επηρεαστεί\, μεταξύ άλλων\, από τους  Johnny Smith\, Hank Garland\, Joe Pass\, Tal Farlow\, Wes Montgomery\, Howard Roberts\, Jim Hall\, and Pat Martino. Από τον Μάρτιο του 2011\, άνοιξε την ιστοσελίδα: Jimmy Bruno's Guitar Workshop\,  που επιτρέπει στους μαθητές του να εξασκηθούν απευθείας από τον Bruno μέσω βίντεο μαθημάτων. Περισσότερες πληροφορίες: http://jimmybruno.com/biography.php  Το μουσικό κομμάτι “Unit Seven” είναι το από το cd του 1996 με τίτλο “Like That”\, που ηχογραφήθηκε στη Νέα Υόρκη και οι περισσότεροι μουσικοί ήταν από την Φιλαδέλφεια. Στο βασικό του τρίο (με μπάσσο τον Craig Thomas και ντράμμερ τον Steve Holloway) της περιόδου του 1990\, προστέθηκε ο  οργανίστας/τρομπετίστας Joey DeFrancesco (επίσης από την Φιλαδέλφεια).  Ο Joey DeFrancesco παίζει όργανο στα περισσότερα από τα 11 κομμάτια\, αλλά και τρομπέτα βαθειά επηρεασμένος από τον τρόπο του Miles Davis (κυρίως στα "There Is No Greater Love" και "Stars Fell on Alabama.")

COL title VAL Jardin d'hiver COL performer VAL Ima	COL video title VAL VinyLiberator-Percy Faith Orchestra-Mountain High\, Valley Low.mp4 COL channel name VAL imfree707 COL description VAL This piece\, Mountain High\, Valley Low\, from The Percy Faith Orchestra's Shangri La album is an awesome\, really dynamic performance by a full orchestra. The record is over 50 years old and has a high amount of surface noise. The extreme detail of the music can be heard\, despite the surface noise.  I've been working to reduce surface noise pickup and have exhausted all the techniques I know of to reduce that noise. That AT92ECD cartridge I use has a .3 X .7 mil stylus and my pre amp system makes no compromises in high frequency response or low noise performance\, so I would especially appreciate suggestions from anyone who may be able to hear and point me to it's cause. Thank you.  UPDATE: 1/14/2012 I've worked up a satisfactory deep-groove cleaning system. I'll be posting very clean records soon and plan to produce a video about my wacky method.

COL title VAL Love Don't Live Here Anymore COL performer VAL Faith Evans with Mary J. Blige	COL video title VAL Bob Wills & His Texas Playboys - Yearning Just for You (1938) COL channel name VAL ASACurator COL description VAL Bob Wills was the driving force behind Western Swing\, a form of Country & Western that fuses Jazz\, Hillbilly\, Blues\, Big Band Swing\, and many more rhythm forms together creating a  truly Unique\, Diverse and Unforgettable sound. Wills' shrewd mix of horns\, fiddles and steel guitar made for a swinging sound that grabbed the public's ear during the mid 1930s and 1940s. Bob Wills was born into a family of fiddlers on March 6\, 1905. His father\, John Wills  regularly won Texas fiddling competitions. Bob learned how to play fiddle and mandolin from his father. As a young man\, Wills performed at house dances\, medicine shows and in 1929 made his debut on the radio.  With commercial sponsorship\, Wills' bands performed on radio in the early 1930s as "Aladdin's Laddies" (for the Aladdin Lamp Co.) and "The Light Crust Doughboys" (for Light Crust Flour). Following a salary dispute\, Wills renamed his band the Texas Playboys and relocated to Tulsa\, Oklahoma\, where he had a live radio show. This exposure led to a contract with the American Recording Corporation - later absorbed into Columbia Records. In September 1935\, Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys recorded their first songs in a makeshift  recording studio in an old Dallas Warehouse. From that point on\, The Texas Playboys became an overnight sensation and recorded prolifically and made such classics as "Steel Guitar Rag"\, "Maiden's Prayer"\, "Take Me Back to Tulsa" and Wills' signature song\, "San Antonio Rose".  Their biggest hit\, was "New Spanish Two Step"\, which topped the country charts for 16 weeks in 1946. The Texas Playboys always had fine singers like Tommy Duncan and Leon McAuliffe\, and Wills punctuated the tunes with jive talking\, falsetto asides and cries of "Ah-ha!" He'd call out soloists by name and instrument\, good-naturedly goading them on to rollicking solo performances. In terms of personnel\, The Texas Playboys expanded and contracted over the years\, according to Wills' desires and the whims of the market. At one point the Texas Playboys were 22 pieces strong\, although the band more typically numbered between 9 and 18 members. There were personnel changes and musical shifts as Wills struggled to adapt to the changing face of  America in the postwar era. Nonetheless\, there was always a solid core of loyal regulars in The Texas Playboys. After leaving Columbia in 1947\, Wills continued to record prolifically for such labels as MGM\, Decca\, Longhorn and Kapp. The group also toured the country and often performed  at a Wills-owned dancehall in Sacramento\, California. In 1968\, Wills was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. A year later\, he suffered a debilitating stroke. There were reunions and recording sessions with many of the old Texas Playboys in 1971 and 1973. Wills' final stroke came in his sleep following the first day of a recording session in December 1973 that resulted in the double album "For the Last Time". Confined to a wheelchair\, he'd reprised his role as bandleader that day with a group of musicians that included former Texas Playboys. He never regained consciousness and died 18 months later on May 13\, 1975. Wills has been revered by such country-music legends as Waylon Jennings\, Willie Nelson\, George Straight\, and Merle Haggard who made a 1976 remake of Bob's 1941 hit "Cherokee Maiden". The contemporary Western Swing group\, Asleep at the Wheel has also cut a pair of tribute albums that have kept Wills' name before the public. Every year\, Bob Wills Day is celebrated on the last Saturday in April in Turkey\, Texas.	0

COL title VAL Expressway to Your Heart COL performer VAL The Vibrations	COL video title VAL Henry Mancini -   Tiny Bubbles COL channel name VAL Socratess2007 COL description VAL "I think there is a song out there to describe just about any situation."― Criss Jami ▼▼▼  HENRY MANCINI Enrico Nicola "Henry" Mancini was an American composer\, arranger and conductor\, who is best remembered for his film and television scores.  He won a record number of Grammy Awards\, plus a posthumous Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995. His best-known works include the jazz-idiom theme to The Pink Panther film series ("The Pink Panther Theme") and the theme to the Peter Gunn television series.  Mancini had a long collaboration with the film director Blake Edwards and won numerous Academy Awards for the songs in Edwards films\, including "Moon River" from Breakfast at Tiffany's\, "Days of Wine and Roses" and for the score to "Victor Victoria". Entering 1946\, Mancini became a pianist and arranger for the newly re-formed Glenn Miller Orchestra\, led by 'Everyman' Tex Beneke. After World War II\, Mancini broadened his skills in composition\, counterpoint\, harmony and orchestration during studies opening with the composers Ernst Krenek and Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco.  In 1952\, Mancini joined the Universal Pictures music department. During the next six years\, he contributed music to over 100 movies\, most notably The Creature from the Black Lagoon\, It Came from Outer Space\, Tarantula\, This Island Earth\, The Glenn Miller Story (for which he received his first Academy Award nomination)\, The Benny Goodman Story and Orson Welles' Touch of Evil. During this time\, he also wrote some popular songs. His first hit was a single by Guy Lombardo and His Royal Canadians titled I Won't Let You Out of My Heart. Mancini left Universal to work as an independent composer/arranger in 1958. Soon after\, he scored the television series Peter Gunn for writer/producer Blake Edwards. This was the genesis of a relationship in which Edwards and Mancini collaborated on 30 films over 35 years.  Along with Alex North\, Elmer Bernstein\, Leith Stevens and Johnny Mandel\, Henry Mancini was a pioneer of the inclusion of jazz elements in the late romantic orchestral film and TV scoring prevalent at the time. Mancini scored many TV movies\, including The Thorn Birds and The Shadow Box. He wrote many television themes\, including Mr. Lucky (starring John Vivyan and Ross Martin)\, NBC Mystery Movie\, What's Happening\, Tic Tac Dough (1990 version) and Once Is Not Enough. In the 1984--85 television season\, four series featured original Mancini themes: Newhart\, Hotel\, Remington Steele\, and Ripley's Believe It or Not. Mancini also composed the "Viewer Mail" theme for Late Night with David Letterman. Mancini composed the theme for NBC Nightly News used beginning in 1975\, and a different theme by him\, titled Salute to the President was used by NBC News for its election coverage (including primaries and conventions) from 1976 to 1992. Salute to the President was only published in a school-band arrangement\, although Mancini performed it frequently with symphony orchestras on his concert tours. Songs with music by Mancini were staples of the easy listening genre from the 1960s to the 1980s. Some of the artists who have recorded Mancini songs include Andy Williams\, Paul Anka\, Pat Boone\, Anita Bryant\, Jack Jones\, Frank Sinatra\, Perry Como\, Connie Francis\, Eydie Gorme\, Steve Lawrence\, Trini Lopez\, George Maharis\, Johnny Mathis\, Jerry Vale and Ray Conniff\, to name just a few.... Mancini recorded over 90 albums\, in styles ranging from big band to light classical to pop. Eight of these albums were certified gold by The Recording Industry Association of America. He had a 20-year contract with RCA Records\, resulting in 60 commercial record albums that made him a household name among artists of easy-listening music.  TINY BUBBLES "Tiny Bubbles" is a song written by Martin Denny and Leon Pober. It was released in 1966 by Don Ho.  It is widely considered to be Denny's most famous song.  MHO "Tiny Bubbles" is -\, with all due respect for Mr Denny\, a rather "simple" song but... hand the notes to a top arranger like Henry Mancini and .... what you get is a fabulous orchestral arrangement that\, in a way\, transforms the song into an easy floating ballad.  A particularly rich instrumentation with strings\, brass\, and all the other "standard" instruments of a large orchestra\, completed with the sound of the ukelele and harp\, so typical for the Hawaiian style music.  The Mancini chorus adds some warmth and "body" to the recording\, so\, in the end\, we get to hear a splendid version of this well known theme.   Have a great (musical) trip to "Aloha country" :) !  Enjoy.	0

Was the singer for several different bands in the 1920s\, including the Colonial Club Orchestra and The Regents Club Orchestra. He disappeared from public view in 1934 when he was laid off from work in the record industry as an executive and then genuinely disappeared for good\, because no one knows what happened to him after that. This was one of his biggest hits\, charting at #25 in 1930 for the year. Also a big(ger) hit for Nat Skrillet in the same year.  Photo is of the Regents Club Dance Hall In Brighton\, England. It was converted to a bingo hall in 1967 and then bulldozed in 1974\, a victim of changing taste in dance music.  50 hits on 9/26/11 100 hits on 11/10/11 250 hits on 3/16/12 500 htis on 9/6/12	1

Visa ble presentert under turneen «Vers og viiiiiiser. Lyriske utskeielser ved Harald Sverdrup og Alf Cranner» i 1966\, og utgitt på LP året samme høst.   Sjømannsvise har blitt en av Cranners mest folkekjære viser\, og den har kommet på flere plateinnspillinger siden.   Den svenske trubaduren Cornelis Vreeswijk lagde en egen tekstversjon av Sjømannsvise som han kalt Ågren.   Han oppgav opprinnelig melodien som «norsk folketone»\, men førte opp Cranner som komponist da han gav ut visa på plata Poem\, ballader och lite blues i 1970.  En sjømannsvise er en vise om sjømenn og livet ombord\, eller en vise som er populær blant sjømenn.   Sjømannsviser kan deles i to grupper. Sjantier som var arbeidssangen ombord på seilskutene og frivaktsviser som var populære sanger blant sjømenn.	0
COL title VAL Lady in Black COL performer VAL Blackmore's Night	COL video title VAL Uriah Heep - Lady in Black COL channel name VAL TheDeZyx COL description VAL http://www.discogs.com/artist/Uriah+Heep http://www.myspace.com/uriaheep  Uriah Heep's by-the-books progressive heavy metal made the British band one of the most popular hard rock groups of the early '70s. Formed by vocalist David Byron and guitarist Mick Box in the late '60s\, the group went through an astonishing number of members over the next two decades — nearly 30 different musicians passed through the band over the years. Byron and Box were members of the mid-'60s rock band called the Stalkers; once that band broke up\, the duo formed another group called Spice. Spice would eventually turn into Uriah Heep in the late '60s\, once Ken Hensley (guitar\, keyboards\, vocals) and bassist Paul Newton joined the pair. Former Spice drummer Alex Napier was the band's drummer for a brief time; he was quickly replaced by Nigel Olsson. Uriah Heep released their debut album Very 'eavy...Very 'umble (called Uriah Heep in the U.S.) in 1970. After its release\, Keith Baker became the group's drummer; he recorded Salisbury\, the group's second album\, before deciding he couldn't keep up with the band's extensive touring and was replaced by Ian Clarke. Salisbury\, featuring a 16-minute title track recorded with a 26-piece orchestra\, showcased the band's more progressive tendencies. Later that year\, Ian Clarke was replaced by Lee Kerslake and Mark Clarke replaced Newton; Mark Clarke quickly left the band and Gary Thain became the group's bassist. This lineup of Uriah Heep was its most stable and popular; beginning with 1972's Demons and Wizards\, they released five albums between 1972 and 1975. After 1975\, the band's popularity began to slip. Byron left the band in 1977 and was replaced by John Lawton\, yet the group's fortunes kept declining right into the early '80s. However\, Uriah Heep soldiered on\, continuing to release albums into the '90s and 2000s. The album roster included Different World (1994)\, Sea of Light (1995)\, Sonic Origami (1998)\, and Spellbinder (1999).	1

COL title VAL Ooh La La COL performer VAL Jools Holland & His Rhythm & Blues Orchestra With Ronnie Wood	COL video title VAL You're Just In Love - Perry Como COL channel name VAL Maureen712 COL description VAL "You're Just in Love" is a popular song by Irving Berlin. It was published in 1950 and was first performed by Ethel Merman and Russell Nype in Call Me Madam\, a musical comedy that debuted at the Imperial Theatre in New York City on October 12 that year. The show ran for 644 performances. Ethel Merman also later starred in the 1953 film version. Theatre lore has it that Berlin wrote the song one night after Call Me Madam was not doing well in tryouts. The second act of the show was lacking. "What I'd like to do is a song with the kid (Russell Nype)\," Merman said. So\, Berlin went to his room and later produced the counterpoint song. When Berlin played the song for Merman\, she said "We'll never get off the stage." According to Berlin's biographer though\, Berlin played the song for Russell Nype first\, but admonished him not to admit he did so because it would infuriate Merman.  Several recorded versions made the charts in 1950-51: by Perry Como and The Fontane Sisters\, by Rosemary Clooney and Guy Mitchell\, and by Ethel Merman and Dick Haymes.  The Perry Como/Fontane Sisters version was recorded on September 26\, 1950 and released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number 20-3945. The record first reached the Billboard magazine charts on December 22\, 1950 and lasted 17 weeks on the chart\, peaking at #5.  The Rosemary Clooney/Guy Mitchell version was recorded on October 21\, 1950 and released by Columbia Records as catalog number 39052. The record first reached the Billboard magazine charts on February 23\, 1951 and lasted 2 weeks on the chart\, peaking at #29.  The Ethel Merman/Dick Haymes version was recorded on October 17\, 1950 and released by Decca Records as catalog number 27317. The record first reached the Billboard magazine charts on March 30\, 1951 and lasted 1 week on the chart\, at #30. Although the lowest charting of the three\, it got a considerable amount of airplay in subsequent years.  Musically\, the song is one of Irving Berlin's three well-known songs that use true counterpoint—a main melody with a secondary melody running at the same time\, both with independent lyrics - his two other best-known counterpoint songs are Play a Simple Melody and "An Old-Fashioned Wedding" (see the 1966 revival of "Annie Get Your Gun").	0

Eindringlich\, lasziv\, ganz nah."   Elly Lapp liebt die Brückenschläge. Für sie sind UFA-Schlager und Popmusik keine  unarrangierbaren Gegensätze\, sondern interpretatorische Herausforderung. Dabei ist eine sehr moderne CD entstanden\,  die gleichzeitig sehr intensiv und sehr persönlich ist. Viel näher geht`s nicht.   Es waren große Songs -- es sind große Songs. Dazu leistet eine interessante Interpretin ihren Beitrag. Elly Lapp. Die studierte Schauspielerin und Sängerin tourt mit eigenen Programmen durch Deutschland -- und sie war die Stimme des Titelsongs der erfolgreichen ARD-Fernsehserie „Kir Royal".  „Der Wind hat mir ein Lied erzählt" - gleichzeitig erste Single - und „Ich steh` im Regen" sind Versuche einer ungewöhnlichen Verbindung von UFA - HIT und POPSOUND. Zarah Leander machte einst diese Songs zu Welterfolgen. Damals hatten die Autoren wohl nie eine Umsetzung mit rockigen Gitarren oder Saxophon im Auge. Hier geben die modernen Instrumente\, wie das gesamte Pop- Arrangement\, eine ganz neue Farbe -- voller Intensität.  Doch die CD von Elly Lapp zeigt die großen Filmhits nicht nur im Popgewand\, sondern auch sehr sparsam\, kunstvoll arrangiert\, als Chansons mit großer interpretatorischer Tiefe.  z.B." Wenn ich mir was wünschen dürfte" und - vor allem - „Der Nowack lässt mich nicht verkommen" -\, ein wahrer Kultsong\, 1959 geschrieben\, sofort auf Schallplatte aufgenommen\, kurzerhand von einem Münchner Gericht verboten und wieder eingestampft -- eine echte Rarität für jedes Rundfunk- und Privatarchiv!	0

COL title VAL Blue (Da Ba Dee) COL performer VAL Eiffel 65	COL video title VAL VinyLiberator-Percy Faith Orchestra-Mountain High\, Valley Low.mp4 COL channel name VAL imfree707 COL description VAL This piece\, Mountain High\, Valley Low\, from The Percy Faith Orchestra's Shangri La album is an awesome\, really dynamic performance by a full orchestra. The record is over 50 years old and has a high amount of surface noise. The extreme detail of the music can be heard\, despite the surface noise.  I've been working to reduce surface noise pickup and have exhausted all the techniques I know of to reduce that noise. That AT92ECD cartridge I use has a .3 X .7 mil stylus and my pre amp system makes no compromises in high frequency response or low noise performance\, so I would especially appreciate suggestions from anyone who may be able to hear and point me to it's cause. Thank you.  UPDATE: 1/14/2012 I've worked up a satisfactory deep-groove cleaning system. I'll be posting very clean records soon and plan to produce a video about my wacky method.

They said you came this way  The eyes of the people who passed him by Were cold and hard as stone The poor boy whimpered and began to cry Because he was all alone  Brother\, where are you? They told me that you came this way Brother\, where are you? They said you came this way  Now there are many Who will swear that it's true That brothers are we all Yet it seems there are very few Who will answer a brother's call  Brother\, where are you?

Mae'r term 'hen ferchetan' yn golygu dynes sydd heb briodi. Traditional Welsh folk song. The term 'hen ferchetan' means a woman who has never married.  The translation 'old maid' doesn't mean that the maid in question is actually old of age :-)  Geiriau: Hen ferchetan wedi colli'i chariad\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. Cael un arall\, dyna oedd ei bwriad\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Ond nid oedd un o lancie'r pentre\, ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, am briodi Lisa fach yr Hendre\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Hen ferchetan sydd yn dal i drio\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. Gwisgo lase sidan ac ymbincio\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Ond os oes brân i frân yn rhywle\, ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, nid oes neb i Lisa fach yr Hendre\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Hen ferchetan bron â thorri'i chalon\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. Mynd i'r llan mae pawb o'r hen gariadon\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Bydd tatws newydd ar bren 'fale\, ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, cyn briodith Lisa fach yr Hendre\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Hen ferchetan aeth i Ffair y Bala\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. Gweld Siôn Prys yn fachgen digon smala\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Gair a ddywedodd wrth fynd adre'\, ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, gododd calon Lisa fach yr Hendre\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.

To get another\, that was her intention\,  ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  But none of the village boys\,  ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, wanted to marry Lisa fach yr Hendre\,  ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  An old maid keeps on trying\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. Wore satin lace and make up\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  But if there's someone for everyone somewhere\, ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, there is no one for Lisa fach yr Hendre\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  The old maid's heart is almost broken\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. All of her old lovers have married\,  ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  There'll be new potatoes on apple trees\, ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, before Lisa fach yr Hendre will marry\,  ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  The old maid went to Fair in Bala\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. Saw Siôn Prys an attractive lad\,  ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  A word he spoke as he went home\, ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, lifted Lisa fach yr Hendre's heavy heart \, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.

COL title VAL Christmas Island COL performer VAL The Lennon Sisters	COL video title VAL Eiffel 65 - Blue (Da Ba Dee) COL channel name VAL malawolf85 COL description VAL Eiffel 65 is a three man (Gianfranco Randone\, Maurizio Lobina\, and Gabriele Ponte) Italian eurodance group. Best know for their international hit "Blue (Da Ba Dee)" Eiffel 65's debut album "Europop" sold over two million units in the US\, making them the best selling Italian eurodance group ever in the United States. The origin of the group's name is an interesting sequence of chance. The name "Eiffel" was chosen randomly by a computer program and the "65" was scribbled onto their name on a demo by mistake; it was actually part of a phone number. The group Eiffel 65 is also known for their many remixes of songs from other artists\, with over thirty of them to their name. In 2005 Gabriele Ponte left the group to focus on his solo career and in 2006 the reminding members left the Bliss Corporation to form their own duo called Bloom 06. The Bliss Corporation\, who owns the name Eiffel 65\, had announced a new line up for the group would be debuting in the summer of 2007 however the debut was postponed until further notice.	0

Join our Youtube: https://goo.gl/8AOGaN Join our Facebook: http://goo.gl/5oL723 Robert Leroy Johnson (May 8\, 1911 -- August 16\, 1938 ) was an American blues singer and musician. His landmark recordings from 1936--37 display a combination of singing\, guitar skills\, and songwriting talent that has influenced later generations of musicians. Johnson's shadowy\, poorly documented life and death at age 27 have given rise to much legend\, including the Faustian myth that he sold his soul at a crossroads to achieve success. As an itinerant performer who played mostly on street corners\, in juke joints\, and at Saturday night dances\, Johnson had little commercial success or public recognition in his lifetime.

COL title VAL Tragedy COL performer VAL Steps	COL video title VAL YVONNE ELLIMAN Hello Stranger COL channel name VAL daveinprogress3 COL description VAL Hawaiian beauty\, Yvonne Elliman\, was not on the pop landscape all that long\, but she made her impact\, and her gorgeous face and sweet but powerful vocals graced the 1970's with a distinctive air. I am posting "Hello Stranger"\, as it is not one of her bigger chart successes\, but it does showcase her wonderful voice and it is a very seventies take on the 60's Barbara Lewis classic.  35 years ago\, "Love me"\, written by the Bee Gees\, was a breakout hit for Yvonne\, giving her a worldwide hit\, including Australia\, where it would ascend the charts and reach #4 in the late summer of 1977. "Hello Stranger" was discovered by me\, once again courtesy of a Various Artist compile - the sexy styled "Ripper 77" with the curvaceous cheeks of a woman adorned with lipstick writing of the names of the 20 original artists featured on the record.  "Hello Stranger"\, like several of the hits on this compile\, was not a hit in Australia\, but three and a half decades later\, it is a fondly considered musical postcard from the era\, and i am eternally grateful to the record companies for releasing those compilations\, even if some of the inclusions were bizarre and obscure.  Back in the halcyon days of the late 1970's\, radio airplay and tv shows like "Countdown" and "Sounds Unlimited" were the few outlets for songs to receive exposure. So many fine recordings were simply overlooked\, because of the few opportunities for visibility or audibility at the time.   1978 would be the major year for Yvonne with another Gibb brothers extravaganza giving her the biggest success of her career with the #1 smash "If I can't have you"\, from  the pop & disco juggernaut "Saturday Night Fever". Another movie soundtrack "Moment by Moment" also starring John Travolta\, would see another recording by Yvonne Elliman - the title track\, but the gentle ballad could not break through the endless litany of disco hits that monopolised 1979. Her own "Love Pains" was her final hit from that part of her career\, and it is a much loved and much covered anthem from the disco era.  I hope "Hello Stranger" gives whoever hears it\, the joy that it has given me.	0

It is thought the versions collected by Mr. Child were incomplete and that the most extensive complete version is a story and not a song at all. A fairy story called "The Golden Ball" The following link lead to the story and you can compare for yourself.  http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/eng/meft/meft04.htm  This is Lead Belly's rendition.

COL title VAL My Resistance Is Low COL performer VAL The Shadows	COL video title VAL Rusty Draper -- My Resistance Is Low COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Rusty Draper  Farrell H. Draper (25 enero 1923 hasta 28 marzo 2003)\,  conocido profesionalmente como Rusty Draper \, era un cantante americano de Pop que logró su mayor éxito en la década de 1950.  Nacido en Kirksville\, Missouri (el apodo de "Rusty" era por su pelo rojo) comenzó a actuar en el programa de radio de su tío en Tulsa \, Oklahoma a mediados de la década de 1930. Draper pasó a trabajar en las estaciones de radio en Des Moines \, Iowa  (veces tomando el lugar del locutor deportivo Ronald Reagan) \, y en Illinois antes de instalarse en California . Allí comenzó a cantar en  clubes \, convirtiéndose en el cantante oficial del casino de San Francisco . A principios de la década de 1950 había empezado a aparecer en programas de televisión nacionales\, incluyendo The Ed Sullivan Show (CBS) y Ozark Jubilee (ABC).  En 1952\, Draper firmó con Mercury Records y lanzó su primera grabación  \, "How Could You (ojos azules)". Al año siguiente\, después de una gira nacional de clubes\, su versión de  Jim Lowe's "Gambler's Guitar" 's llegó al N º 6 en las listas de éxitos de todo el paçis\, y vendió un millón de copias\, consiguiendo  un disco de oro.  Tras una serie de éxitos menores\, volvió a lo más alto en 1955 con "Seventeen" (N º 18)\, "El Shifting\, Whispering Sands" (N º 3) y "Are You Satisfied?" (No. 11)\, convirtiéndose en uno de los cantantes  de pop  con más éxito de la época.  En 1962\, firmó con con Monument Records \, con cada vez menos éxito en las listas ya que su estilo se fue quedando anticuado. Sin embargo\, él continuó teniendo éxitos menores durante la década de 1960.  Apareció en musicales de teatro y en la televisión\,  Draper murió de neumonía \, en Bellevue\, Washington \, a la edad de 80 años.

This is proven true\, given the fact that I recently discovered her albums—and I just haven't had my fill. I've searched and purchased everything I could find from such a gifted songstress. Lorez crafts each lyric with such grace and tonality that could easily match (if not surpass) the reigning jazz stylists of the bop/jazz/pop age. She gives each standard a new sense of evocative meaning as far as lyrics are concerned\, and reinvents the wheel each time she unleashes her enthralling voice. As she once said "A lyric is dead\, until you breathe life into it." This is exactly what she does. Enjoy and listen in HD\, to the lovely—Lorez Alexandria. All right(s) to 1959 King Records\, Inc.	0

COL title VAL Bermuda COL performer VAL The Four Seasons	COL video title VAL Eiffel 65 - Blue (Da Ba Dee) COL channel name VAL malawolf85 COL description VAL Eiffel 65 is a three man (Gianfranco Randone\, Maurizio Lobina\, and Gabriele Ponte) Italian eurodance group. Best know for their international hit "Blue (Da Ba Dee)" Eiffel 65's debut album "Europop" sold over two million units in the US\, making them the best selling Italian eurodance group ever in the United States. The origin of the group's name is an interesting sequence of chance. The name "Eiffel" was chosen randomly by a computer program and the "65" was scribbled onto their name on a demo by mistake; it was actually part of a phone number. The group Eiffel 65 is also known for their many remixes of songs from other artists\, with over thirty of them to their name. In 2005 Gabriele Ponte left the group to focus on his solo career and in 2006 the reminding members left the Bliss Corporation to form their own duo called Bloom 06. The Bliss Corporation\, who owns the name Eiffel 65\, had announced a new line up for the group would be debuting in the summer of 2007 however the debut was postponed until further notice.	0

COL title VAL It Ain't Easy COL performer VAL Dave Edmunds	COL video title VAL Hello Stranger - The Supremes & The Four Tops COL channel name VAL MotownConnoisseur30 COL description VAL Here is another outstanding cover from the third duet album from The Supremes & The Four Tops entitled "Dynamite" from 1971.  Aside from Barbara Lewis' 1963 original\, I think this version is the best of all the covers ever done of the song. It is musical perfection.  Written by: Barbara Lewis Produced by: Bobby Taylor and Frank Wilson Track recorded: May 3\, 1971 Additional overdubs\, strings and horn sessions recorded in Los Angeles: Dates unknown Levi Stubbs lead vocal recorded: June 5\, 1971 & August 17\, 1971 Four Tops background vocals recorded: June 9\, 1971 Jean Terrell lead vocal recorded: June 10\, 1971 Supremes background vocals recorded: June 24\, 1971  This version is the best song on the entire LP and one of the best duets the groups did together over the three albums. Motown was foolish not to release this as a single. It screams hit and would have been one had Motown promoted it\, but at the time The Supremes and The Four Tops were no longer Motown's top priority. Nonetheless\, it still remains an incredible cover.  ****No copyright infringement intended****	0

COL title VAL Romeo and Juliet COL performer VAL Coles Whalen	COL video title VAL Monte Montgomery - Romeo and Juliet COL channel name VAL Ian Hickey COL description VAL Live at the Caravan of Dreams  NARRATOR: A love-struck Romeo sings the streets a serenade Laying everybody low with a love song that he made. Finds a streetlight\, steps out of the shade Says something like\, "You and me babe\, how about it?"  Juliet says\, "Hey\, it's Romeo\, you nearly gave me a heart attack!" He's underneath the window\, she's singing\, "Hey la\, my boyfriend's back. You shouldn't come around here singing up to people like that... Anyway\, what you gonna do about it?"  ROMEO: Juliet\, the dice was loaded from the start And I bet when you exploded into my heart And I forget I forget the movie song. When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong\, Juliet?  Come up on different streets\, they're both the streets of shame. Both dirty\, both mean\, yes\, in the dream it was just the same And I dreamed your dream for you and now your dream is real. How can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals?  When you can fall for chains of silver\,  You can fall for chains of gold\, You can fall for pretty strangers  And the promises they hold. You promised me everything\, you promised me thick and thin\, yeah! Now you just say\, "Oh Romeo? Yeah\, you know I used to have a scene with him".  Juliet\, when we made love\, you used to cry. You said\, "I love you like the stars above\, I'll love you 'til I die". There's a place for us\, you know the movie song. When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong\, Juliet?  I can't do the talk\, like the talk on TV And I can't do a love song\, like the way it's meant to be. I can't do everything\, but I'll do anything for you. I can't do anything\, 'cept be in love with you! And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be. All I do is keep the beat... and bad company. Now all I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme\, Juliet\, I'd do the stars with you any time!  Juliet\, when we made love you used to cry. You said\, "I love you like the stars above\, I'll love you 'til I die". There's a place for us\, you know the movie song. When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong\, Juliet?  NARRATOR: And a love-struck Romeo sings a street-suss serenade Laying everybody low with a lovesong that he made Finds a convenient streetlight\, steps out of the shade He says something like\, "You and me babe\, how about it?"  ROMEO: You and me babe\, how about it?	1

Join our Youtube: https://goo.gl/8AOGaN Join our Facebook: http://goo.gl/5oL723 Robert Leroy Johnson (May 8\, 1911 -- August 16\, 1938 ) was an American blues singer and musician. His landmark recordings from 1936--37 display a combination of singing\, guitar skills\, and songwriting talent that has influenced later generations of musicians. Johnson's shadowy\, poorly documented life and death at age 27 have given rise to much legend\, including the Faustian myth that he sold his soul at a crossroads to achieve success. As an itinerant performer who played mostly on street corners\, in juke joints\, and at Saturday night dances\, Johnson had little commercial success or public recognition in his lifetime.

COPYRIGHTS RESERVED BY COPYRIGHT OWNER.This video is used only for non-profit usage and publishing. The Animals were an English music group of the 1960s formed in Newcastle upon Tyne during the early part of the decade\, and later relocated to London. Known for their gritty\, bluesy  sound and deep-voiced frontman Eric Burdon -- as exemplified by their number one signature song "The House of the Rising Sun" as well as by hits such as "We Gotta Get Out of This Place" and "It's My Life" -- the band balanced tough\, rock-edged pop singles against rhythm and blues-oriented album material. They became known in the U.S. as part of the British Invasion.  The Animals underwent numerous personnel changes in the mid-1960s and suffered from poor business management. Under the name Eric Burdon and the Animals\, they moved to California and achieved commercial success as a psychedelic rock band\, before disbanding at the end of the decade. Altogether\, the group had ten Top Twenty hits in both the UK and U.S.  The original lineup had a brief comeback in 1977 and 1983. There have been several partial regroupings of the original era members since then under various names. The Animals were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.	0

COL title VAL Break on Through COL performer VAL Night Shift	COL video title VAL Maynard Ferguson - Chameleon COL channel name VAL malawolf85 COL description VAL Walter Maynard Ferguson\, best know for his extreme high register control on trumpet\, was a Canadian jazz trumpet player and bandleader. Born in Verdun\, Quebec (now part of Montreal) Maynard by the age of four was playing piano and violin but at 9 years of age he switched to cornet. At age thirteen\, Maynard first soloed as a child prodigy with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Orchestra and was heard frequently on the CBC\, notably featured on a "Serenade for Trumpet in Jazz" written for him by Morris Davis. Maynard won a scholarship to the French Conservatory of Music where he studied from 1943 through 1948 with Bernard Baker. Maynard dropped out of Montreal High School at age 15 to more actively pursue a music career\, performing in dance bands led by Stan Wood\, Roland David\, and Johnny Holmes. During this period\, Maynard came to the attention of numerous American bandleaders and began receiving offers to come to the United States. Maynard moved to the United States in 1949 and initially played with the bands of Boyd Raeburn\, Jimmy Dorsey\, and Charlie Barnet. The Barnet band was notable for a trumpet section that also included Doc Severinsen\, Ray Wetzel\, Johnny Howell\, and Rolf Erickson. When Barnet temporarily retired in 1949 and disbanded his orchestra\, Maynard was free to accept an offer to join Stan Kenton's newly formed Innovations Orchestra\, a 40-piece jazz concert orchestra with strings. While the Innovations Orchestra was not commercially successful\, it made a number of remarkable recordings\, including "Maynard Ferguson\," one of a series of pieces named after featured soloists. When Kenton returned to a more practical 19-piece jazz band\, Maynard continued with him. So popular was Maynard with Kenton that for three years running\, 1950\, 1951\, and 1952\, he won the Down Beat Readers' Poll as best trumpeter. In 1953\, Maynard left Kenton to become a first-call session player for Paramount Pictures. Ferguson appeared on 46 soundtracks including The Ten Commandments. Ferguson still recorded jazz during this period\, but his Paramount contract prevented him from playing jazz clubs. While he enjoyed the regular paycheck\, Ferguson was very unhappy with the lack of live performance opportunities and left Paramount in 1956. In 1956\, Maynard was tapped to lead the Birdland Dream Band\, a 14-piece big band formed by Morris Levy as an "all-star" lineup to play at Levy's Birdland jazz club in New York City. While the name "Birdland Dream Band" was short-lived and is represented by only two albums\, this band became the core of Maynard's performing band for the next nine years. Following the path taken by many jazz artists in the 1960s\, Ferguson left the United States. Feeling that he needed a period of spiritual exploration. Maynard formed a new band and it made its North American debut in 1971. Maynard latched on to the burgeoning jazz education movement by recruiting talented musicians from colleges with jazz programs and targeting young audiences with performances and master classes in high schools. This practical and strategic move helped him develop a strong following that would sustain him for the remainder of his career. In 1988\, Maynard formed the group Big Bop Nouveau\, a nine-piece band featuring three trumpets\, one trombone\, two reeds and a three-piece rhythm section. The band's repertoire included original jazz compositions and modern arrangements of jazz standards\, with occasional pieces from his '70s book and the Birdland Dream Band; this format proved to be successful with audiences and critics. In 1992\, he was inducted into the Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame. Just days after completing a weeklong run at New York's Blue Note and recording a studio album in New Jersey\, Maynard developed an abdominal infection that resulted in kidney and liver failure.

COL title VAL A Thousand Years COL performer VAL Christian Bautista	COL video title VAL Joan of Arc (Leonard Cohen) - Allison Crowe w. lyrics COL channel name VAL Allison Crowe COL description VAL On her debut album "secrets" Allison Crowe covers this Leonard Cohen song. Her voice and piano is accompanied by Jo Lundstrom (Rosehip Jam\, Black Velvet Band) on accordion. Crowe engineered the recording\, with production by Rainer Willeke (of Victoria\, B.C.'s Raindog Studios).  http://music.allisoncrowe.com/track/joan-of-arc  The photo of Allison Crowe is by Billie Woods.  MOJO magazine's December '08 issue paid tribute to "Rock's Greatest Poet" Leonard Cohen with a celebration of his "deep and moving music". Of Allison Crowe's contribution of "Joan of Arc" to its 'All Star Tribute"\, (featuring Judy Collins\, Nick Cave\, Katie Melua\, Martha Wainwright\, Dion and others)\, a cover-mount CD titled "Cohen Covered"\, MOJO says: "Once famously described by the Vancouver Courier as possessing a style akin to 'Elton John meets Edith Piaf'\, the Canadian singer-songwriter Allison Crowe is renowned for her ability to blend control and melodrama. Certainly she does so on this spirited cover of Cohen's 'Songs of Love and Hate' classic\, a track which also powerfully showcases her considerable talent as a fine interpreter of song."  "Any album that features a track from Leonard Cohen is certainly heading in the right direction. But when it is covered so beautifully\, it makes you realise what an amazing lyricist Leonard Cohen is. Joan of Arc is the Cohen song covered on this album and it's certainly in my top 10 of Cohen covers. It's also my favorite track on (Secrets)" ~ Colin Meeks\, indielaunchpad.com (USA)  Joan of Arc  Words & Music by Leonard Cohen As performed by Allison Crowe  Now the flames they followed Joan of Arc as she came riding through the dark; no moon to keep her armour bright\, no man to get her through this dark and smoky night.   She said\, "I'm tired of the war\, I want the kind of work I had before\, A wedding dress or something white to wear upon my swollen appetite."  Well\, I'm glad to hear you talk this way\, I've watched you riding every day and there is something in me that yearns to win such a cold\, such a lonesome heroine.  "And who are you?" she sternly spoke to the one beneath the smoke. "Why\, I'm fire\," he replied\, "And I love your solitude\, I love your pride."  "Well\, then\, fire make your body cold\, I'm going to give you mine to hold." And saying this she climbed inside to be his one\, to be his only bride.  Then deep into his fiery heart he took the dust of Joan of Arc\, and high above all these wedding guests he hung the ashes of her lovely wedding dress.  It was deep into his fiery heart he took the dust of Joan of Arc\, and then she clearly understood if he was fire\, oh\, she must be wood.  I saw her wince\, I saw her cry\, I saw the glory in her eye. Myself I long for love and light\, but must it come so cruel\,  must it be so bright?	0

The song has been covered many times. Cliff's version was informed by the version from Jerry Butler and Betty Everett according to the sleeve.  This track is from the 1965 album\, "Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers" which was released on EMI. Unlike virtually all other Brit R&B bands of the sixties\, with the exception of Georgie Fame's Blue Flames\, Cliff & the Rebel Rousers had a predominantly sax based sound.  This was their first album. It's tight sound shows the benefit of years slogging it out on the road. There's also a more imaginative selection of material than heard from some of their peers.  It was produced by John Burgess  The musicians were:  Dave Wendells - Lead Guitar Bobby Thomson - Bass Maurice Groves - Sax Sid Phillips - Sax Roy Young - Piano\, Organ Mick Burt - Drums	0

At the dawn of the new millennium\, songwriter\, producer\, and multi- instrumentalist Klayton created Celldweller\, a ground-breaking aural entity for the next age. Thriving on originality\, Celldweller cross-bred electronic styles such as Drum'n'Bass and Psy-Trance with modern Alternative Rock and Metal on his self-titled debut\, released independently in 2003.  The Celldweller album met with critical acclaim while climbing to #17 on the Billboard Internet Sales Chart. Celldweller gained Top 40 Metal Radio charting with the track "I Believe You" pulling into a solid 11th place on the R&R Alternative Specialty Show Chart. Achieving a feat shared by only an elite handful of albums\, every song on Celldweller was eventually licensed for use in popular media. These songs were heard in movie trailers\, TV shows\, and games such as Spider Man 2\, Constantine\, Crackdown\, Need for Speed: Most Wanted\, Enter the Matrix\, CSI\, UFC\, The Shield\, and more.  Now\, Celldweller has been reissued to celebrate the tenth anniversary of its release with updated artwork and a second disc of remixes\, demos\, and previously unheard rarities (all remastered for this release). While Klayton busies himself in his Detroit studio preparing the future of Celldweller for 2013\, celebrate the past with this monumental work.  Want to use FiXT music in your YouTube videos?

COL title VAL Just a Little Bit of Rain COL performer VAL Mick Harvey	COL video title VAL Maddox Brothers & Rose - No Help Wanted COL channel name VAL HillbillyBoogie1 COL description VAL The Maddox Brothers and Rose\, known as America's Most Colorful Hillbilly Band from the 1930s to the 1950s\, consisted of four brothers\, Fred\, Cal\, Cliff and Don Maddox\, along with their sister Rose. Cliff died in 1949 and was replaced by brother Henry. The group disbanded in 1956.  The family hailed from Boaz\, Alabama\, but rode the rails and hitch hiked to California in 1933 when the band members were still children\, following the failed efforts of their sharecropper parents during the early part of the Depression. They were a little in advance of the flood of Okies who were to flood the state in the 30s. They struggled to make a living as intinerant fruit and vegetable pickers following the harvest as far north as Washington state\, and as far east as Arizona\, as well as in the San Joaquin Valley. They often worked from dawn to dusk\, sleeping and eating on the ground.  Having settled in Modesto\, the family developed their musical ability and\, in 1937 performed on the radio\, sponsored by a local furniture store. In 1939 they entered a hillbilly band competition at the centenial Sacramento State Fair after driving to Sacramento in their Model A. When they took the stage they tore through "Sally Let Your Bangs Hang Down" with rocking rhythms and risque lyrics. They became\, officially\, California's best hillbilly band.  The brothers and Rose appeared at places such as the 97th Street Corral in Los Angles.  From 1946-1951 the group recorded for 4 Star Records (Hollywood)\, then for Columbia Records. Some 4 Star masters were leased and released by US.-Decca Records at the beginning of the 1950s. The following quotes are from Rose Maddox. "We were called hillbilly singers - not country - then. No\, none of this country music then. People just called us hillbilly... People tell me that I was one of the first women to sing what I sang - country boogie. I guess I was. There was no rock 'n' roll in those early days\, before 1955. Only country boogie. My brothers also played that way. We called it country then.  The Maddox's material ranged from the country standards of Hank Williams and Merle Travis\, cowboy songs\, to the Western swing of Bob Wills\, to old-time\, folk\, and church singing\, to jazz\, swing\, boogie woogie and even a taste of early rock and roll.  Fred Maddox played upright bass using the "slap bass" technique as early as 1937.[5] This trademark backbeat\, a slapping bass style\, helped drive a broad change in popular music\, sporting a faster\, immediately discernible rhythm that came to be known as rockabilly.  Fred Maddox's bass is displayed at the Experience Music Project in Seattle. "They wanted his bass because they believe he might have hit the first note of rock 'n' roll on it.	0

At the dawn of the new millennium\, songwriter\, producer\, and multi- instrumentalist Klayton created Celldweller\, a ground-breaking aural entity for the next age. Thriving on originality\, Celldweller cross-bred electronic styles such as Drum'n'Bass and Psy-Trance with modern Alternative Rock and Metal on his self-titled debut\, released independently in 2003.  The Celldweller album met with critical acclaim while climbing to #17 on the Billboard Internet Sales Chart. Celldweller gained Top 40 Metal Radio charting with the track "I Believe You" pulling into a solid 11th place on the R&R Alternative Specialty Show Chart. Achieving a feat shared by only an elite handful of albums\, every song on Celldweller was eventually licensed for use in popular media. These songs were heard in movie trailers\, TV shows\, and games such as Spider Man 2\, Constantine\, Crackdown\, Need for Speed: Most Wanted\, Enter the Matrix\, CSI\, UFC\, The Shield\, and more.  Now\, Celldweller has been reissued to celebrate the tenth anniversary of its release with updated artwork and a second disc of remixes\, demos\, and previously unheard rarities (all remastered for this release). While Klayton busies himself in his Detroit studio preparing the future of Celldweller for 2013\, celebrate the past with this monumental work.  Want to use FiXT music in your YouTube videos?

COL title VAL Walk Between Raindrops COL performer VAL The Ray Gelato Giants	COL video title VAL Bert Kaempfert - The Way It Used To Be COL channel name VAL Socratess2007 COL description VAL Bert Kaempfert knew exactly which 'hitparade' songs could be 'transformed' into a "Kaempfert classic".  When Engelbert Humperdinck scored a major hit with "The Way it used to Be" in 1968\, Bert heard right away that this magnificent melody had all the elements it took for a 'new' Kaempfert track.  Bert obviously wrote a new orchestral arrangement\, where after a "new easy listening classic" was born :)  The album "Traces Of Love" - from which the track is taken - breathes quality from beginning to end.   Here we can listen to a Bert Kaempfert 'at his best' - bringing his tunes with an even larger orchestra and with audio technicians (eg Peter Klemt) behind the controls who make use of the newest recording technology available (at the time\, ie in 1969). If ever the term "heavenly music" could be used\, it sure is here.  Bert Kaempfert created music\, that\, without any doubt\, will please audiences for generations to come. From the 1969 album "Traces Of Love" here is "Mister Hitmaker" once again bringing you "The Way It Used To Be".  Enjoy.	0

Rob Ivey (Batching It)  http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#!/pages/Batching-It/141041665946741 http://www.myspace.com/batchingit09 http://www.twitter.com/batching_it  From Batching It's debut album "Homage".  The Unforgiven as originally performed by Metallica.  Batching It is a one-man punk-rock cover band featuring Rob Ivey\, a San Francisco East Bay musician. Hailing from Vallejo\, CA\, Rob was previously in Vallejo bands Bottomdawg and The V-Town Have-Nots \, and also played drums in Diabolical Exploits with veteran punk-rock producer Andy Ernst\, who has produced such notable bands as Green Day\, Rancid\, and AFI.  The name 'Batching It' is short for 'batcheloring it'\, or 'going it alone'\, which perfectly describes the philosophy behind the project. After many years of not being in a band\, Rob's nostalgia kicked in and he decided that it was time to make a cover album of influential bands/songs\, songs and bands that inspired him to become a musician in his teenage years. The first Batching It project\, due out in the Fall of 2009 on Leficit Records\, is called 'Homage' - a self-explanatory title. Rob wanted to pay tribute to these bands and songs by reintroducing them to the new generation\, and covered in Rob's personal favorite styles.  Recorded at the legendary Art of Ears studio in Hayward\, CA by Andy Ernst\, and produced by Mike Lawson of Leficit Records\, 'Homage' is a 15-track nod to\, in Rob's opinion\, 15 awesome bands: NOFX\, Skankin' Pickle\, Swingin' Utters\, Pearl Jam\, Rancid\, Lagwagon\, Metallica\, Sublime\, No Use For a Name\, Smashing Pumpkins\, Weezer\, No Doubt\, The Descendents\, Less Than Jake\, and Operation Ivy. Crossing rock genres\, just like Rob's personal tastes\, 'Homage' should have something for everyone.	1

COL title VAL It Hurts to Be in Love COL performer VAL Bobby Vinton	COL video title VAL Hoagy Carmichael - Little Old Lady COL channel name VAL 2ndviolinist COL description VAL From www.hoagy.com  Hoagland Howard Carmichael was born in 1899 in Bloomington. His father was an itinerant laborer who moved his family throughout the Midwest looking for steady work\, always returning to Indiana. "Home" was back in Bloomington\, where they'd left his wife Lida's golden oak piano. She helped support the family by playing at the local movie house and for university dances. "Ragtime was my lullaby\," Hoagy said\, and though his mother was thrilled when he picked out a tune on the golden oak\, she warned him: "Music is fun\, Hoagland\, but it don't buy you cornpone."  Lida Carmichael thought her son might grow up to be president of a railroad. He might have\, too\, because ambition burned hot in him\, but in 1919 he heard Louie Jordan's band (not to be confused with Louis Jordan who had a popular band in the thirties) in Indianapolis and this black ensemble of early jazz players "exploded in me almost more music than I could consume." Hoagy went on to study law at Indiana University but he was already a "jazz maniac" and his own band\, The Carmichael Syringe Orchestra\, was made up of a gang of loose cannons whose spiritual leader was a Dada-inspired poet named Monk. "There are other things in this world besides hot music\," Monk advised Hoagy in a serious moment\, "I forget what they are--but they're around." Those 'other things' were named Dorothy Kelly\, and to Hoagy she was more than first love. Dorothy was a secure respectable life in one of those big houses up on the hill in Bloomington he'd dreamt of as a boy\, and when he held her in his arms\, that was what he wanted more than anything else.  Then Hoagy heard a young white cornetist named Bix Beiderbecke and\, "it threw my judgment out of kilter." This was a sound like nothing he'd heard before and when Hoagy played an improvised tune for Bix\, the strange young man with a magical horn said\, "Whyn't you write music\, Hoagy?" The rest of his life was the answer to Bix's question.  Many years later\, when an audience saw the mature Hoagy sitting at the piano singing "Lazybones" or "Ole Buttermilk Sky" in what he called his 'native wood-note and flatsy- through-the-nose voice\,' it looked so natural and relaxed that it was easy to assume he'd led a charmed life. But Hoagy's road to success was just as bumpy and lurching as his friend Bix's was smooth and quick.After a modest but deceptive early success with "Washboard Blues" and "Riverboat Shuffle\," Hoagy packed a bag and went to New York. But he soon found himself scuffling around the cold\, lonely town\, not selling anything but bonds in a bottom-end job at a Wall St. brokerage house. "I'm singing the music publisher's theme song-it ain't a commercial\," he wrote back to Monk. He tried to give up--more than once--but the words of another old friend kept him going. Reggie Duval\, a black barber and dance hall pianist in Indianapolis\, was the only teacher Hoagy ever had besides his mother. Reggie had taught Hoagy how to make music 'jump' and also gave him a creed to live by: "Never play anything that don't sound right. You might not make any money--but at least you won't get hostile with yourself."  Hoagy kept writing what sounded 'right' and in 1930 made recordings of "Georgia On My Mind\," "Rockin' Chair\," and "Lazy River." Other artists heard the new songs and within a year Louis Armstrong\, Duke Ellington and the Dorsey brothers had recorded their own versions and were performing them on the new hot medium\, radio. Hoagy Carmichael himself was still barely known to the public\, but they were hearing and singing his songs\, and in 1936 Hoagy went to Hollywood where "the rainbow hits the ground for composers."  During the next decade\, Hoagy moved from backstage into the spotlight. He worked with lyricists Johnny Mercer\, Frank Loesser and Mitchell Parish. He became a star performer on records\, radio and stage with a signature style\, and began appearing in movies\, most memorably in "To Have and Have Not" and "The Best Years of Our Lives". He got married and fathered two sons. In one year\, 1946\, he had three of the top four songs on the Hit Parade\, and in 1951 he and Mercer won an Oscar for "In the Cool\, Cool\, Cool of the Evening." He hosted his own television show\, "The Saturday Night Review."  'Hoagy' was no longer a peculiar name\, he was a star\, even an American icon. He was also someone you knew\, a guy you wished you could have a drink and share a laugh with. He had the same joys and desires\, disappointments and fears you had\, and some of his songs--"Lazy River\," "Heart and Soul"-- became so familiar they sounded as if no one had written them\, they'd just always been there.	0

B side covers Frank Zappa's track.  Published by Carin Music.  ------------------------  "Willie the Pimp" is a blues rock song from Frank Zappa's 1969 album Hot Rats.

The song has also appeared on Zappa's Fillmore East - June 1971 and You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore\, Vol. 4 albums.  The album title Hot Rats comes from a lyric of Willie the Pimp. The origin of the song was explained in a conversation Zappa recorded in 1972. This interview recording was later released as "The Story of Willie the Pimp" on the Zappa album Mystery Disc.  The song was ranked number 75 on the list of "The 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time" of Rolling Stone.

With very different vocal tones and style\, Beccy and Melinda do great justice to a generous amount of iconic tracks on their duet album. I chose this recording\, as the best known (although not the original) version by Juice Newton is pretty hard to top. but these two ladies give it a red hot go! I love the unique qualities they bring to this set\, and they seem to be having a great old time doing it\, as well. They filmed a very cute vid for their version of '9 to 5' - check it out - it gives people a sense of the performers and their great approach. Melinda is the daughter of yodelling superstar Mary Schneider\, and Beccy's mum Carole Sturtzel was regarded as the Queen of Country Music in South Australia. For me it is a lovely opportunity here to be able to post a clip of these two wonderful daughters and celebrate the terrific careers they have both carved out for themselves. Both have multiple Golden Guitar awards (Australia's Country Music Prizes) and have scored many hits from their already prolific catalogues.   Happy Mother's Day to all the wonderful Mums out there.	0

(Brown's Sex Machine double album\, also released in 1970\, contains a different\, 11-minute-long performance of the song rather than the version released as a single.)  "Sex Machine" was one of the first songs Brown recorded with his new band\, The J.B.'s. In comparison with his 1960s funk hits such as "Papa's Got A Brand New Bag" and "Cold Sweat"\, it is notable for the de-emphasis of the horn section. Instead\, the song centers on the insistent riff played by brothers Bootsy and Catfish Collins on bass and guitar and Jabo Starks on drums\, along with the call and response interplay between Brown and Bobby Byrd's vocals.  The original single version of "Sex Machine" begins with a brief spoken dialogue between Brown and the members of his band\, which was recreated (with minor variations) in live performances: Fellas\, I'm ready to get up and do my thing! (Yeah! That's right! Do it!) I want to get into it\, man\, you know? (Go ahead! Yeah!) Like a\, like a sex machine\, man\, (Yeah!) movin'\, doin' it\, y'know? (Yeah!) Can I count it off? (Okay! Alright!) One\, two\, three\, four!  The song's freeform lyrics consist mostly of Brown's exhortations to "Get up / stay on the scene / like a sex machine" along with Byrd's regular shouts of "Get on up." The piece is harmonically static\, aside from a move to the subdominant on the bridge.  In 2004\, "Sex Machine" was ranked number 326 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest songs of all time.  Other versions  Brown recorded a reworking of the original song for his 1975 album Sex Machine Today.  The Flying Lizards recorded a successful cover of "Sex Machine" in 1984 which appeared on their album Top Ten.  In 1986 the Japanese musician Haruomi Hosono and his band F.O.E. recorded vocal and instrumental cover versions of "Sex Machine" for the album F.O.E. #1: Sex\, Energy and Star. The instrumental version featured a guest solo by Brown's longtime saxophonist Maceo Parker.  German comedian and jazz musician Helge Schneider recorded a comedic version of the song for his 1995 album Es rappelt im Karton. It was also released as a single with an accompanying video that features Schneider walking around a metro station making faces.  The rock band Widespread Panic covered the song on their 2004 live album Jackassolantern.  Jazz fusion/Blues guitarist Larry Coryell covered the song on his album Electric.  Sampling  Sy Smith and her back-up singer LeJon Walker sampled the song during their performance of "Think (About It)"\, which is featured on her DVD Sy Smith Live: Worship at the Temple.  Appearances in other media  "Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine" has appeared in a number of feature films\, including City of God\, Twisted\, Legally Blonde\, Lock\, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\, Friday and The Tuxedo (in which it is performed by Jackie Chan). It has also been used in an episode of the television sitcom Scrubs and in commercials for the Renault Clio and Tassimo. The song was featured on the Pontiac commercial.  The song figures prominently in the 2003 Japanese film Get Up!\, a comedy about a James Brown-obsessed yakuza gangster. The film's title (which transliterates into Japanese as Geroppa!) is taken from the song's lyrics.  British satirical puppet show Spitting Image ended an episode with an opera-style cover of the song\, starring Luciano Pavarotti.  Part 1 of "Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine" is available as downloadable content for the Rock Band series of video games.	0

"You're a Grand Old Flag" is a patriotic song of the United States. The song\, a spirited march written by George M. Cohan\, is a tribute to the U.S. flag. In addition to obvious references to the flag\, it incorporates snippets of other popular songs\, including one of his own. Cohan wrote it in 1906 for George Washington\, Jr.\, his stage musical.  The song was first publicly performed on February 6\, the play's opening night\, at Herald Square Theater in New York City. "You're a Grand Old Flag" quickly became the first song from a musical to sell over a million copies of sheet music. The title and first lyric comes from someone Cohan once met; the Library of Congress website notes:  The original lyric for this perennial George M. Cohan favorite came\, as Cohan later explained\, from an encounter he had with a Civil War veteran who fought at Gettysburg. The two men found themselves next to each other and Cohan noticed the vet held a carefully folded but ragged old flag. The man reportedly then turned to Cohan and said\, "She's a grand old rag." Cohan thought it was a great line and originally named his tune "You're a Grand Old Rag." So many groups and individuals objected to calling the flag a "rag\," however\, that he "gave 'em what they wanted" and switched words\, renaming the song "You're a Grand Old Flag." — Library of Congress	0

COL title VAL When You Believe COL performer VAL Michelle Pfeiffer and Sally Dworsky	COL video title VAL cruel to be kind\, cover\, pitwork\, 1999\, clover records COL channel name VAL pitworkwork COL description VAL review by Mike DaRonco  Pitwork can be easily compared to a warm summer day on a playground: innocent\, bouncy\, and full of energy. Cheesy metaphors aside\, this Japanese duo minimally incorporates playful pop and an eclectic use of instruments: from the basic structure of drums\, bass\, and guitar to drum machines and harmonica to even a canned audience. Happy-go-lucky all the way through\, this self-titled EP manages to cover some new ground in indie pop without being overly sentimental or experimental. Fans of Tiger Trap\, the Softies and Stereolab should take notice.	0

Purchase from the label: http://www.paradiseofbachelors.com/shop/pob-21 Purchase from Bandcamp: https://paradiseofbachelors.bandcamp.com/album/ambsace Other options: http://lnk.to/PoB21  The second album of astonishing duets by guitarists James Elkington (who has toured and/or recorded with Jeff Tweedy\, Richard Thompson\, and Steve Gunn\, among others) and Nathan Salsburg (an accomplished soloist deemed by NPR “one of those names we’ll all associate with American folk guitar”) is a sublime suite of nimble\, filigreed compositions by two singular stylists. Belying its title—“ambsace” is the lowest throw of dice; snake eyes—the record thrives on a gentle empathy and generosity of spirit\, sitting sneakily protean original compositions alongside gorgeous arrangements of songs by Duke Ellington and The Smiths at the same big hand-hewn table.

He performed in a range of music genres\, including pop\, rock'n'roll\, folk\, and country.    He started as a songwriter for Connie Francis\, and recorded his own first million-seller "Splish Splash" in 1958.

He was present on the night of June 4/5\, 1968\, at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles at the time of Kennedy's assassination. The same year\, he discovered that he had been brought up by his grandmother\, not his mother\, and that the girl he had thought to be his sister was actually his mother.

In most English versions of the song the basic story is that of a condemned maiden pleading for someone to buy her freedom from the executioner. It is thought the versions collected by Mr. Child were incomplete and that the most extensive complete version is a story and not a song at all. A fairy story called "The Golden Ball" The following link lead to the story and you can compare for yourself.  http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/eng/meft/meft04.htm  This is Lead Belly's rendition. It is a mixture of singing and spoken word\, and amazing guitar picking and playing.	0

COL title VAL The Unforgiven COL performer VAL Batching It	COL video title VAL PAUL JABARA Yankee Doodle Dandy COL channel name VAL daveinprogress3 COL description VAL With the imminent Independence day holiday\, I am posting this odd little minor hit from Oscar and Grammy winning Paul Jabara. Best known for the hits 'No more Tears'\, 'Last Dance' and 'It's raining men'\, Jabara died in 1992. His classic songs have been with me all these years & are among my all time favourite compositions. He left us way too soon.  'Yankee Doodle Dandy' it seems was never released as an A side single in America\, but it did show up on the Australian charts for a solitary week back in June of 1978\, entering the Top 100 at #99. Strangely\, some 5 weeks later it resurfaced and spent a further 8 weeks climbing to a peak of #64! It was featured on his 1977 LP 'Shut Out'.   My apologies for the incomplete version of the song. The song ex vinyl cuts off about twenty seconds before its end.   Enjoy it anyway\, please! To all my American friends - have a great Independence Day.	0
COL title VAL Elastic Heart COL performer VAL Travis Atreo	COL video title VAL TIME OUT FOR TEARS -Bill Lawrence COL channel name VAL montanarecordhunter COL description VAL Columbia 39029   I ended up with about 100 vintage old LP's and while they have little if any monetary or collector value given condition and storage issues yet I couldn't bear to get rid of them.  I am going through the whole collection and putting all of them online.  I started this channel because posting all of this music on my main mining and carpentry channel was driving subscribers away.  Some of the stuff is kind of rare and a bunch of it will be the only copy on youtube.  In theory all of these records are for sale if you want them.  Message me in the comments.   All of the records are being played on Zenith 6R-668 tube type radio and record player.  When I picked it up from the leftovers pile at the estate it was not working.  While not a record player expert by any means\, I was able to get it operable.  The needle is rough but after carefully reshaping it on a diamond stone I got it to play much better.  So far no replacement needle can be located.  I found one that fit the holder but it was the newer style and didn't work with 78's.  You can get a look at the player by following this link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YCtwrOdGb8 We have no intention of fighting any content challenges; even the bogus ones and so will simply acknowledge and move on.  My only goal is to put it out there before it is gone.  In theory any of these records is for sale and you need but drop me a line in the comments.  I do intend to monetize but understand we are talking a predicted whole channel income of less than $5 a month.  Anything helps and this take a lot of times so please don't hate me for that. --Ken	0

COL title VAL Fleurette africain COL performer VAL Terri Lyne Carrington feat. Clark Terry	COL video title VAL ALBERT HAMMOND - When you tell me that you love me -Class Master- -demo unplugged- COL channel name VAL Jose Luis Montecristo COL description VAL Sir Albert Hammond (nombrado Oficial de Honor de la Orden del Imperio Británico por la Reina Isabel II de Inglaterra por su aportación al mundo de la música) ha vendido más de 360 millones de discos en todo el mundo con sus canciones\, interpretadas por él mismo y por otros grandes artistas de la talla de Julio Iglesias\, Willie Nelson\, Whitney Houston\, Diana Ross\, Luz Casal\, Starhip... Las canciones de Albert Hammond han liderado las listas de éxitos internacionales tanto de pop como de R&B\, country\, de estilo "adult contemporary" y de música latina\, con frecuencia de manera simultánea. Entre esas canciones se incluyen conocidos números 1 como "When I Need You"\, "Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now" (nominada a los Oscar®\, los Globos de Oro y los Grammy)\, "One Moment in Time" y "To All the Girls I've Loved Before". Auténticos himnos musicales como "One Moment in  Time"\, una canción que compuso para que se convirtiera en el tema oficial de los Juegos Olímpicos en 1988 y que llevó a Albert a recibir su primer Emmy\, y "Cantaré\, Cantarás" (el equivalente en el mercado de música en español del clásico "We Are the World")\, un tema que Albert co-escribió y produjo\, son dos ejemplos de la capacidad de Albert Hammond para componer canciones que se instalan desde el principio en el inconsciente colectivo de millones de personas.  Albert es un experto colaborador con un gran talento con la guitarra\, el piano y la interpretación vocal\, y ha formado  parte de algunos de los equipos de compositores con mayor éxito en la industria discográfica. Junto a su colega en labores de composición Mike Hazlewood\, con el que ha trabajado durante muchos años\, ha co-escrito muchos de sus éxitos\, entre ellos el clásico "The Air that I Breathe". Además\, Albert ha co-escrito grandes temas de éxito junto a Diane Warren\, entre ellos el famoso "I Don't Wanna Live Without Your Love" de Chicago\, "Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now" de Starship\, "Careless Heart" de Roy Orbison\, "Don't You Love Me Anymore" de Joe Cocker y "Don't Turn Around"\, una canción que ha alcanzado el éxito en tres ocasiones en las voces de Ace of Base\, Neil Diamond y el grupo Aswad. Asimismo\, Albert también ha compuesto  diversos éxitos junto a Hal David ("99 Miles from L.A." y "To All the Girls I've Loved Before") y John Bettis ("One Moment  in Time"\, "When You Tell Me That You Love Me" y "I Need To Be In Love"\, el gran éxito que popularizó el grupo The  Carpenters).  Entre las estrellas que han grabado canciones compuestas por Albert Hammond se encuentran muchos de los artistas más importantes del panorama musical contemporáneo\, incluyendo a Celine Dion\, Whitney Houston\, Aretha Franklin\, Tina Turner\, Elton John\, Joe Cocker\, Diana Ross\, Johnny Cash\, K.D. Lang\, Julio Iglesias y Josh Groban\, entre otros grandes nombres.  En 2008 Albert recibió la invitación para incorporarse al prestigioso Songwriter's Hall of Fame\, y también ha recibido la Orden del Imperio Británico (OBE) de manos de Su Majestad la Reina Isabel II de Inglaterra. Gibraltar\, la ciudad donde creció\, ofrecerá próximamente un homenaje a Albert Hammond a través de la edición de una serie de sellos postales conmemorativos que incluirán su imagen y destacarán asimismo sus mayores éxitos internacionales.	0

COL title VAL Back in Baby's Arms COL performer VAL David Houston & Tammy Wynette	COL video title VAL ♥ "She Loves Me" - by Jack Jones COL channel name VAL 65Seasons COL description VAL Song: She Loves Me Singer: Jack Jones  "She Loves Me" is a musical with a book by Joe Masteroff\, lyrics by Sheldon Harnick\, and music by Jerry Bock.  The musical is the fifth adaptation of the play Parfumerie by Hungarian playwright Miklos Laszlo\, following the 1940 James Stewart-Margaret Sullavan film The Shop around the Corner and the 1949 Judy Garland-Van Johnson musical version In the Good Old Summertime.   The 1978 BBC version starring Robin Ellis and Gemma Craven is worth watching too.  It would surface yet again in 1998 as the Tom Hanks-Meg Ryan feature You've Got Mail. The plot revolves around Budapest shop employees Georg Nowack and Amalia Balash who\, despite being consistently at odds with each other at work\, are unaware that each is the other's secret pen pal met through lonely-hearts ads. The musical premiered on Broadway in 1963\, and subsequently had productions in the West End in 1964 and award-winning revivals on each side of the Atlantic in the 1990s\, as well as regional productions. ***	0

It is the eighth track from the American pop duo's fifth and final studio album\, Bridge Over Troubled Water. The song was also issued as the B-Side to the duo's "Cecilia" single.  Simon wrote this as a thinly-veiled message to Art Garfunkel\, referring to a specific incident where Garfunkel went to Mexico to act in the film Catch-22. Simon was left alone in New York writing songs for Bridge over Troubled Water\, hence the lonely feelings of "The Only Living Boy In New York." Simon refers to Garfunkel in the song as Tom\, referring to their early days when they were called Tom and Jerry\, and encourages him to "let your honesty shine...like it shines on me". The background vocals feature both Garfunkel and Simon recorded together in an echo chamber\, multi-tracked around eight times.	0

Original track by The Rolling Stones - a new single from Fruits de Mer Records - 7" colour vinyl - just 300 pressed for worldwide distribution\, on sale now - order direct from us at www.myspace.com/fdmer2  The Rolling Stones are an English rock band. The band formed in 1962 in London when original leader Brian Jones and pianist Ian Stewart were joined by vocalist Mick Jagger and guitarist Keith Richards. Jagger and Richards early on formed a songwriting partnership and gradually took over leadership of the band from the increasingly troubled and erratic Jones. Bassist Bill Wyman and drummer Charlie Watts completed the early lineup. Stewart\, deemed unsuitable as a teen idol\, was removed from the official lineup in 1963 but continued to work with the band as road manager and keyboardist until his death in 1985.  The band's early recordings were mainly covers of American blues and R&B songs. After first achieving success in the UK\, they became popular in the US during the "British Invasion" of the early 1960s. Their 1965 single "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction" established The Rolling Stones as a premier rock and roll act. Starting with their 1966 album Aftermath\, the songs of Jagger and Richards\, aided by the instrumental experimentation of Jones\, expanded an always-present stylistic flexibility.  2000 Light Years from home lyrics Sun turnin' 'round with graceful motion  We're setting off with soft explosion  Bound for a star with fiery oceans  It's so very lonely\, you're a hundred light years from home   Freezing red deserts turn to dark  Energy here in every part  It's so very lonely\, you're six hundred light years from home   It's so very lonely\, you're a thousand light years from home  It's so very lonely\, you're a thousand light years from home   Bell flight fourteen you now can land  Seen you on Aldebaran\, safe on the green desert sand  It's so very lonely\, you're two thousand light years from home  It's so very lonely\, you're two thousand light years from home	0

It was recorded by Joan Baez (credited as "traditional") and released on her 1962 album Joan Baez in Concert\, Part 1\, and also by the English rock band Led Zeppelin\, who included it on their 1969 debut album Led Zeppelin.  Other interpretations of the Bredon song include versions by: The Plebs (1964 Decca Records UK/MGM Records USA)\, The Association in 1965 (also doing a live version in 1970) and British pop singer Mark Wynter in 1965.  Quicksilver Messenger Service recorded a variation on the song in 1967.  Welsh band Man would later cover the QMS song on their 1976 album Maximum Darkness (recorded live at Roundhouse\, Chalk Farm on 26 May 1975).  Joan Baez version  Whilst a student at UC-Berkeley in around 1960\, Anne Bredon appeared on a live folk-music radio show The Midnight Special on radio station KPFA\, on which she sang "Babe\, I'm Gonna Leave You". A fellow folk singer who guested on The Midnight Special\, Janet Smith\, took up the song and developed it further\, playing it live at hootenanny folk-song events at Oberlin College\, one performance of which was attended by Joan Baez.  Baez requested Smith to send her a recording of her songs\, including "Babe\, I'm Gonna Leave You"\, which Baez subsequently began performing herself. It became the opening track on Joan Baez in Concert\, Part 1.  Initially\, the song had no writers' credit\, but after Smith contacted Bredon\, who confirmed her authorship\, later pressings of ...In Concert gave the writing credit to Bredon.  Led Zeppelin version  The band covered Baez's version: both guitarist Jimmy Page and singer Robert Plant were fans of Baez. Baez's album had originally indicated no writing credit\, and Led Zeppelin credited the song as "Trad. arr. Page". In the 1980s Bredon was made aware of Led Zeppelin's version of the song and since 1990 the Led Zeppelin version has been credited to Anne Bredon/Jimmy Page & Robert Plant: Bredon received a substantial back-payment of royalties.  Page played the song to Plant at their first meeting together\, at Page's riverside home at Pangbourne in late July 1968. It is sometimes stated that the arrangement evolved when Plant played Page the guitar part that eventually appeared on the album but\, in an interview he gave with Guitar World magazine in 1998\, Page denied this\, noting that he had worked out the arrangement long before he met Plant\, had told him he would like it on the album\, and that Plant at that time did not play the guitar.  It is rumored that Page recorded another version of the song\, with Steve Winwood in 1968\, that was never released. The band played this song at Led Zeppelin concerts on its 1969 concert tours\, then Page and Plant brought it back in a 9-minute version for their 1998 reunion. A live\, filmed performance of "Babe I'm Gonna Leave You"\, from Led Zeppelin's gig on Danmarks Radio at Gladsaxe\, Denmark\, on March 17\, 1969\, is featured on the Led Zeppelin DVD (2003).  At the 1:41 mark of Led Zeppelin's version of "Babe I'm Gonna Leave You"\, it is possible to hear Plant singing\, "I can hear it calling me" just before he sings the same line in full volume: bleed from Plant's scratch vocal appears on the drum tracks\, which were recorded with the full band.  Record producer Rick Rubin has remarked\, "It ["Babe I'm Gonna Leave You"] is a song with a classical nature that also really rocks. It really takes you on a trip." The song is featured on the 2006 One Tree Hill episode entitled "The Show Must Go On".  As a result of touring in the United States and watching various "Led Zeppelin" cover bands and other artists perform this song Robert Plant performed the song with his band "Strange Sensations" and as a solo artist.  Although a cover itself\, numerous artists have covered the Led Zeppelin version of the song\, crediting Page/Plant/Bredon..  1971: Pyg (Free with PYG [recorded live 1971]) 1996: Great White (Stage) 2000: Paul Oakenfold (Perfecto Presents: Another World [remix by Quivver]) 2002: Cactus Jack (DisCover) 2002: Doro (The Music Remains the Same: A Tribute to Led Zeppelin) 2005: Hal Lindes (Get the Lead Out) 2007: Vanilla Fudge (Out Through the In Door) 2007: Carl Kennedy with Dirty South (Onelove: Your Disco Will Eat You [remix]) 2008: Tony Franklin (Rock N' Pop Ballads) 2008: Joe Lynn Turner (Led Box: The Ultimate Led Zeppelin Tribute) 2009: P!nk (As part of her Funhouse Tour) 2011: Overload (As part of Overload Live at the Apartment Sessions) 2011: Dorians (Live in Erevan)	0

COL title VAL Because COL performer VAL Lettermen	COL video title VAL Ruby Wright - Bimbo COL channel name VAL AFantasticVoyage COL description VAL VARIOUS: THEN 1954  1954 -- now\, that's what we call an exceptional year! Perhaps best remembered in Britain for the end of rationing after 14 years\, 1954 also saw the marriage of Marilyn Monroe to Joe Di Maggio\, the first royal tour of Australia\, the breaking of the four-minute mile by runner Roger Bannister\, and the first World Cup to be televised.  Much memorable music was also made that year\, and you can hear many of the most popular hits from back then right now on THEN 1954\, continuing the new series from Fantastic Voyage\, the label that brings you the highly popular British Hit Parade compilations. Unlike that series\, which provides two multi-disc sets per year intended for the serious chart completists out there\, the THEN series has the more casual music buyer in mind.  Although THEN 1953 includes many UK and US chart-toppers\, the series is not constrained by chart position or label in its aim of presenting the most memorable sounds of each year. Successive volumes of THEN will follow over the coming months. Each one is compiled and annotated by eminent chartwatcher Dave McAleer\, the former chief consultant and contributor to the now defunct Guinness Book Of British Hit Singles\, who is currently devising pop quiz books for the Official Charts Company and assisting with the Virgin Book Of British Hit Albums.  Dave's sleeve notes spend as much time recalling the news events of the year as they do exploring the musical highlights. If you are looking to build up a library of the most enduring British hits from each year\, THEN is the series for you. If you are looking for a souvenir of a particular year -- to remember a birth\, a first kiss\, or a wedding -- THEN will provide the soundtrack to those memories.	0

It is now out of print and fairly pricey\, so here's a vinyl rip for your enjoyment. Bette Bright was originally a prominent vocalist with Liverpool legends Deaf School before her solo career. This album features the likes of Clive Langer\, Ian Broudie\, James Eller and Lee "Kix" Thompson of Madness. Bette Bright (real name Anne Martin) married Graham "Suggs" McPherson (no introduction necessary) and retired from music to start a family. Recently\, however\, she has re-emerged along with Deaf School\, playing several reunion and tribute gigs. Oh and any eagle-eyes among us will have spotted a red-wigged Bette in the Sex Pistols movie Rock 'N' Roll Swindle (check the scene where Steve Jones...soils the gold record). Enjoy and t'interweb Bette's name for loads more information.	1

COL title VAL This Woman's Work COL performer VAL Maxwell	COL video title VAL Maddox Brothers & Rose - No Help Wanted COL channel name VAL HillbillyBoogie1 COL description VAL The Maddox Brothers and Rose\, known as America's Most Colorful Hillbilly Band from the 1930s to the 1950s\, consisted of four brothers\, Fred\, Cal\, Cliff and Don Maddox\, along with their sister Rose. Cliff died in 1949 and was replaced by brother Henry. The group disbanded in 1956.  The family hailed from Boaz\, Alabama\, but rode the rails and hitch hiked to California in 1933 when the band members were still children\, following the failed efforts of their sharecropper parents during the early part of the Depression. They were a little in advance of the flood of Okies who were to flood the state in the 30s. They struggled to make a living as intinerant fruit and vegetable pickers following the harvest as far north as Washington state\, and as far east as Arizona\, as well as in the San Joaquin Valley. They often worked from dawn to dusk\, sleeping and eating on the ground.  Having settled in Modesto\, the family developed their musical ability and\, in 1937 performed on the radio\, sponsored by a local furniture store. In 1939 they entered a hillbilly band competition at the centenial Sacramento State Fair after driving to Sacramento in their Model A. When they took the stage they tore through "Sally Let Your Bangs Hang Down" with rocking rhythms and risque lyrics. They became\, officially\, California's best hillbilly band.  The brothers and Rose appeared at places such as the 97th Street Corral in Los Angles.  From 1946-1951 the group recorded for 4 Star Records (Hollywood)\, then for Columbia Records. Some 4 Star masters were leased and released by US.-Decca Records at the beginning of the 1950s. The following quotes are from Rose Maddox. "We were called hillbilly singers - not country - then. No\, none of this country music then. People just called us hillbilly... People tell me that I was one of the first women to sing what I sang - country boogie. I guess I was. There was no rock 'n' roll in those early days\, before 1955. Only country boogie. My brothers also played that way. We called it country then.  The Maddox's material ranged from the country standards of Hank Williams and Merle Travis\, cowboy songs\, to the Western swing of Bob Wills\, to old-time\, folk\, and church singing\, to jazz\, swing\, boogie woogie and even a taste of early rock and roll.  Fred Maddox played upright bass using the "slap bass" technique as early as 1937.[5] This trademark backbeat\, a slapping bass style\, helped drive a broad change in popular music\, sporting a faster\, immediately discernible rhythm that came to be known as rockabilly.  Fred Maddox's bass is displayed at the Experience Music Project in Seattle. "They wanted his bass because they believe he might have hit the first note of rock 'n' roll on it.	0

COL title VAL Jonny COL performer VAL Marlene Dietrich	COL video title VAL You're Just In Love - Perry Como COL channel name VAL Maureen712 COL description VAL "You're Just in Love" is a popular song by Irving Berlin. It was published in 1950 and was first performed by Ethel Merman and Russell Nype in Call Me Madam\, a musical comedy that debuted at the Imperial Theatre in New York City on October 12 that year. The show ran for 644 performances. Ethel Merman also later starred in the 1953 film version. Theatre lore has it that Berlin wrote the song one night after Call Me Madam was not doing well in tryouts. The second act of the show was lacking. "What I'd like to do is a song with the kid (Russell Nype)\," Merman said. So\, Berlin went to his room and later produced the counterpoint song. When Berlin played the song for Merman\, she said "We'll never get off the stage." According to Berlin's biographer though\, Berlin played the song for Russell Nype first\, but admonished him not to admit he did so because it would infuriate Merman.  Several recorded versions made the charts in 1950-51: by Perry Como and The Fontane Sisters\, by Rosemary Clooney and Guy Mitchell\, and by Ethel Merman and Dick Haymes.  The Perry Como/Fontane Sisters version was recorded on September 26\, 1950 and released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number 20-3945. The record first reached the Billboard magazine charts on December 22\, 1950 and lasted 17 weeks on the chart\, peaking at #5.  The Rosemary Clooney/Guy Mitchell version was recorded on October 21\, 1950 and released by Columbia Records as catalog number 39052. The record first reached the Billboard magazine charts on February 23\, 1951 and lasted 2 weeks on the chart\, peaking at #29.  The Ethel Merman/Dick Haymes version was recorded on October 17\, 1950 and released by Decca Records as catalog number 27317. The record first reached the Billboard magazine charts on March 30\, 1951 and lasted 1 week on the chart\, at #30. Although the lowest charting of the three\, it got a considerable amount of airplay in subsequent years.  Musically\, the song is one of Irving Berlin's three well-known songs that use true counterpoint—a main melody with a secondary melody running at the same time\, both with independent lyrics - his two other best-known counterpoint songs are Play a Simple Melody and "An Old-Fashioned Wedding" (see the 1966 revival of "Annie Get Your Gun").	0

His playing was always emotionally charged\, regardless of the specific mood: cocky and exuberant on up-tempo groovers\, blistering on bop-oriented technical showcases\, sweet and sensitive on ballads. In his early days as a teen prodigy\, Morgan was a busy soloist with a taste for long\, graceful lines\, and honed his personal style while serving an apprenticeship in Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers.	0

The original line-up consisted of Brian le Gassick – lead vocals\, guitar\, John Leach – lead guitar\, Willie van der Walt – bass and Ian Miller – drums. In 1962 Leach and van der Walt were replaced by Richard Crouse – guitar\, Jimmy Routledge – bass and Billy Andrews – vocals\, harmonica (Billy later became one half of the duo the “Dream Merchants” with Billy Forrest). In 1964 the Staccatos won the Transvaal Merseyside Contest\, which included a recording contract with EMI. They supported Peter and Gordon on their tour of South Africa in 1965.  In 1966 Steve Lonsdale took over the lead vocals\, and Richard Crouse married Wanda Arletti who joined the group for a tour of Zambia. In 1967 Eddie Boyle – bass\, and Ronnie Cline – organ\, joined the group. In 1968 Billy Forrest approached the group to record “Cry to me” for the film “Katrina”. This song became their biggest hit\, reaching number 1 on the South African Top 20 in 1969 and charting for a massive 38 weeks\, earning them a double gold disc.  In 1969 John Elliot – sax\, joined the group and in 1970 Ivor Black – drums and Peter Vee – lead vocals (Steve Lonsdale left for America).  This song is off the album “Come Back Silly Girl” released in 1965. It's a cover of a Dean Martin song from 1965.  On this album the line-up was: Ian Miller (drums and group leader)\, Richard Crouse (lead guitar)\, Billy Andrews (lead vocals and harmonica)\, Jimmy Ryan (bass) and Brian le Gassick (rhythm guitar).	0

COL title VAL Help Me COL performer VAL Micke Muster	COL video title VAL Betty Johnson -- I Need You Now (VintageMusic.es) COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Betty Johnson 16 de marzo 1929 (otras fuentes dicen 1931)  es una cantante norteamericana que alcanzó su pico de carrera en la década de 1950. Cuando era adolescente\, fue contratada por Columbia Records e hizo algunas grabaciones\, ninguna de las cuales tuvieron éxito. En 1951\, Percy Faith \, que la había conocido por sus grabaciones de Columbia\, trató de convencer a Mitch Miller ( A & R\, el director de Columbia) para firmar con ella\, pero Miller\, que incluye Doris Day y Rosemary Clooney \, entre los artistas que habían firmado\, no veía la necesidad firmar con ella.  Johnson lanzó el álbum para niños\, con Eddy Arnold producido por Simon and Schuster \, que posteriormente la contrató para su propio sello discográfico\, Bell Records en 1954. En el mismo año firmó un contrato con Csida-Grean\, una sociedad de gestión que había manejado la carrera de Arnold. Charles Grean\, miembro  de esa compañía\,  produjo muchas de sus grabaciones posteriores. En 1955\, firmó un contrato con RCA Victor Records \, que la envió a Chicago\, Illinois .  En Chicago\, Johnson trabajó con Arnold de nuevo en su  serie\, Eddy Arnold Time\, respaldado por un grupo que había trabajado con su familia en el Grand Ole Opry\, The Jordanaires . Este grupo más tarde fue conocido como un grupo de apoyo de Elvis Presley .  En 1957 se casó con Grean\, aunque el matrimonio sólo duraría hasta 1961\, la relación profesional continuó. Luego fue contratada por Jack Paar para su programa de televisión\, Tonight . Esto condujo a un contrato discográfico con Atlantic Records en 1957\, para el que tuvo su próximo gran éxito\, "Little Blue Man".  Johnson continuó en Tonight hasta 1962 cuando Jack Paar fue reemplazado por Johnny Carson.

Original track by The Rolling Stones - a new single from Fruits de Mer Records - 7" colour vinyl - just 300 pressed for worldwide distribution\, on sale now - order direct from us at www.myspace.com/fdmer2  The Rolling Stones are an English rock band. The band formed in 1962 in London when original leader Brian Jones and pianist Ian Stewart were joined by vocalist Mick Jagger and guitarist Keith Richards. Jagger and Richards early on formed a songwriting partnership and gradually took over leadership of the band from the increasingly troubled and erratic Jones. Bassist Bill Wyman and drummer Charlie Watts completed the early lineup. Stewart\, deemed unsuitable as a teen idol\, was removed from the official lineup in 1963 but continued to work with the band as road manager and keyboardist until his death in 1985.  The band's early recordings were mainly covers of American blues and R&B songs. After first achieving success in the UK\, they became popular in the US during the "British Invasion" of the early 1960s. Their 1965 single "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction" established The Rolling Stones as a premier rock and roll act. Starting with their 1966 album Aftermath\, the songs of Jagger and Richards\, aided by the instrumental experimentation of Jones\, expanded an always-present stylistic flexibility.  2000 Light Years from home lyrics Sun turnin' 'round with graceful motion  We're setting off with soft explosion  Bound for a star with fiery oceans  It's so very lonely\, you're a hundred light years from home   Freezing red deserts turn to dark  Energy here in every part  It's so very lonely\, you're six hundred light years from home   It's so very lonely\, you're a thousand light years from home  It's so very lonely\, you're a thousand light years from home   Bell flight fourteen you now can land  Seen you on Aldebaran\, safe on the green desert sand  It's so very lonely\, you're two thousand light years from home  It's so very lonely\, you're two thousand light years from home	0

Talk about a lead singer being camera shy - you only saw his face maybe 5 or 6 times during the performance. Most of the time his back was to the audience. Being that I saw them over 44 yrs ago\, the only thing that I can remember about them was that they didn't seem very tight and they still looked like they were trying to find their place.

COL title VAL Ich weiß\, es wird einmal ein Wunder geschehen COL performer VAL The Feetwarmers	COL video title VAL VinyLiberator-Percy Faith Orchestra-Mountain High\, Valley Low.mp4 COL channel name VAL imfree707 COL description VAL This piece\, Mountain High\, Valley Low\, from The Percy Faith Orchestra's Shangri La album is an awesome\, really dynamic performance by a full orchestra. The record is over 50 years old and has a high amount of surface noise. The extreme detail of the music can be heard\, despite the surface noise.  I've been working to reduce surface noise pickup and have exhausted all the techniques I know of to reduce that noise. That AT92ECD cartridge I use has a .3 X .7 mil stylus and my pre amp system makes no compromises in high frequency response or low noise performance\, so I would especially appreciate suggestions from anyone who may be able to hear and point me to it's cause. Thank you.  UPDATE: 1/14/2012 I've worked up a satisfactory deep-groove cleaning system. I'll be posting very clean records soon and plan to produce a video about my wacky method.

COL title VAL The Devil Went down to Georgia COL performer VAL Jerry Reed	COL video title VAL Toy Dolls \, The devil went down to Scunthorpe =;-) COL channel name VAL THECHURCHOFPUNK1 COL description VAL The devil went down to Scunthorpe\, looking for a soul to steal In a bind an' way behind he was willin' to make a deal. He came across this young man pickin' on a guitar\, playing it hot an' An' the devil jumped on a hickory stump an' said 'I'll tell ya what' I guess you didn't know it\, I'm a guitar player too\, and if you care to take a dare I make a bet with you. Now you play a real good guitar boy\, but give the devil his due\, I'll bet a guitar of gold against you soul 'cause i think i'm better then you.  The boy said my name's Johnny\, it might be a sin\, i'll take your bet You're gonna regret\, I'm the best I've ever been.  Johnny rosen up your pick an' play your guitar hard 'cause hell's broke loose in scunthorpe an' the devil deals the cards. Now if you win you'll get this shinny guitar made of gold\, but if you loose the devil gets your soul!  The devil opened up his case and said 'i'll start this gig' and fire flew from his finger tips as he rosened up his pick. He strummed the pick across the strings it made an evil hiss Then a band of demons joined in and it sounded somthing like this  When the devil finished Johnny said 'You're pretty good ol' son\, but sit down in that chair right there let me show you how it's done!'  Fire on the mountain run boy's run! Devil's in the house of the risen sun! Chicken in the bread pan picken out dough! Granny does your dog bite\, no child\, no!   The devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat\, and he laid that golden gitar on the ground at Johnny's feet. Johnny said 'devil just come on back if you ever want to try again\, I done told you once you son of a bitch i'm the best I've ever been!'  Fire on the mountain run boy's run! Devil's in the house of the risen sun! Chicken in the bread pan picken out dough! Granny does your dog bite\, no child\, no!	1

Lyrics:  Southern nights Have you ever felt a southern night? Free as a breeze Not to mention the trees Whistling tunes that you know and love so  Southern nights Just as good even when closed your eyes I apologize to anyone who can truly say That he has found a better way  Feel so good Feel so good It's frigth'ning Wish I could\, Stop this world from fighting. La da da da da da la da da da da da da da da  Southern skies Have you ever noticed southern skies? It's precious beauty lies just beyond the eye. It goes running through your soul Like the stories told of old  Old man He and his dog that walked the old land Ev'ry flower touched his cold hand As he slowly walked by Weeping willows Would cry for joy Joy  Mysteries Like this and many others in the trees Blow in the night In the southern skies.  Southern nights They feel so good it's fright'ning... Wish I could stop this world from fighting La da da da da da la da da da da da	0

Versjon fra albumet "Velvalgte viser".  Dette er en sang som jeg liker veldig godt og som betyr veldig mye for meg. ___________________________________  Ja fysst så vil je nevne min stilling og min stæinn\, je står og svarver hatter i Salomo sitt læinn. Sjøl bær je navnet Jørgen\, så skilnaden er stor\, men både je og Salomo kom nakne tel vår jord.  Refr.:  Sola skin på deg så skuggen fell på meg men graset er grønt for æille.  Når liljene på marken i fager blomstring står\, og alle himlens fugler sin glade trille slår\, je nynne såmmå strofa i hattemakergrenn\, og morgendagen\, Salomo\, hva vet vel vi om den?  Refr.  Har Salomo sitt måltid med vin og fylte fat\, je sug på harde skorper og kæille det for mat\, men det vi gir ifrå øss di vi i lønndom går blir gras til hyrdens hvite lam og Sarons sorte får.  Refr.  Når dronningen av Saba gjør Salomo visitt\, je ser a "Lea Lettvint" og hu har tenkt seg hit. Om leiet blir forskjellig frå silkeseng tel strå\, vi går mot såmmå paradis og hører harper slå.  Refr.  Når sola synk og dale bak slottets tårn og tind\, så kjæm den mørke natta med drøm og tankespinn\, der blir je sjøl Kong Salomo og hæin blir kænskje den som står og svarver hatter uti hattemakergrenn.

COL title VAL No Help Wanted COL performer VAL The Crows	COL video title VAL Maddox Brothers & Rose - No Help Wanted COL channel name VAL HillbillyBoogie1 COL description VAL The Maddox Brothers and Rose\, known as America's Most Colorful Hillbilly Band from the 1930s to the 1950s\, consisted of four brothers\, Fred\, Cal\, Cliff and Don Maddox\, along with their sister Rose. Cliff died in 1949 and was replaced by brother Henry. The group disbanded in 1956.  The family hailed from Boaz\, Alabama\, but rode the rails and hitch hiked to California in 1933 when the band members were still children\, following the failed efforts of their sharecropper parents during the early part of the Depression. They were a little in advance of the flood of Okies who were to flood the state in the 30s. They struggled to make a living as intinerant fruit and vegetable pickers following the harvest as far north as Washington state\, and as far east as Arizona\, as well as in the San Joaquin Valley. They often worked from dawn to dusk\, sleeping and eating on the ground.  Having settled in Modesto\, the family developed their musical ability and\, in 1937 performed on the radio\, sponsored by a local furniture store. In 1939 they entered a hillbilly band competition at the centenial Sacramento State Fair after driving to Sacramento in their Model A. When they took the stage they tore through "Sally Let Your Bangs Hang Down" with rocking rhythms and risque lyrics. They became\, officially\, California's best hillbilly band.  The brothers and Rose appeared at places such as the 97th Street Corral in Los Angles.  From 1946-1951 the group recorded for 4 Star Records (Hollywood)\, then for Columbia Records. Some 4 Star masters were leased and released by US.-Decca Records at the beginning of the 1950s. The following quotes are from Rose Maddox. "We were called hillbilly singers - not country - then. No\, none of this country music then. People just called us hillbilly... People tell me that I was one of the first women to sing what I sang - country boogie. I guess I was. There was no rock 'n' roll in those early days\, before 1955. Only country boogie. My brothers also played that way. We called it country then.  The Maddox's material ranged from the country standards of Hank Williams and Merle Travis\, cowboy songs\, to the Western swing of Bob Wills\, to old-time\, folk\, and church singing\, to jazz\, swing\, boogie woogie and even a taste of early rock and roll.  Fred Maddox played upright bass using the "slap bass" technique as early as 1937.[5] This trademark backbeat\, a slapping bass style\, helped drive a broad change in popular music\, sporting a faster\, immediately discernible rhythm that came to be known as rockabilly.  Fred Maddox's bass is displayed at the Experience Music Project in Seattle. "They wanted his bass because they believe he might have hit the first note of rock 'n' roll on it.	1

Når liljene på marken i fager blomstring står\, og alle himlens fugler sin glade trille slår\, je nynne såmmå strofa i hattemakergrenn\, og morgendagen\, Salomo\, hva vet vel vi om den?  Refr.  Har Salomo sitt måltid med vin og fylte fat\, je sug på harde skorper og kæille det for mat\, men det vi gir ifrå øss di vi i lønndom går blir gras til hyrdens hvite lam og Sarons sorte får.  Refr.  Når dronningen av Saba gjør Salomo visitt\, je ser a "Lea Lettvint" og hu har tenkt seg hit. Om leiet blir forskjellig frå silkeseng tel strå\, vi går mot såmmå paradis og hører harper slå.  Refr.  Når sola synk og dale bak slottets tårn og tind\, så kjæm den mørke natta med drøm og tankespinn\, der blir je sjøl Kong Salomo og hæin blir kænskje den som står og svarver hatter uti hattemakergrenn.

This is proven true\, given the fact that I recently discovered her albums—and I just haven't had my fill. I've searched and purchased everything I could find from such a gifted songstress. Lorez crafts each lyric with such grace and tonality that could easily match (if not surpass) the reigning jazz stylists of the bop/jazz/pop age. She gives each standard a new sense of evocative meaning as far as lyrics are concerned\, and reinvents the wheel each time she unleashes her enthralling voice. As she once said "A lyric is dead\, until you breathe life into it." This is exactly what she does. Enjoy and listen in HD\, to the lovely—Lorez Alexandria. All right(s) to 1959 King Records\, Inc.	0

Unlike virtually all other Brit R&B bands of the sixties\, with the exception of Georgie Fame's Blue Flames\, Cliff & the Rebel Rousers had a predominantly sax based sound.  This was their first album. It's tight sound shows the benefit of years slogging it out on the road. There's also a more imaginative selection of material than heard from some of their peers.

It was released in Australia in mid 1975 on a Bootleg 45\, BL-249. It charted in Adelaide (# 37)\, but failed to find much favour anywhere else in Australia.  The flipside is the excellent country/rock track\, "Fire At Shepard's Flat"\, which I've also uploaded to YouTube.

Mina vocalizza tutta la parte melodica del brano anche se non compare nei crediti del disco. Scrive Antonio Bianchi sulla Fanzine 72 del Mina Fan Club "Quella versione\, tutta sospiri e intimità\, era stata additata dai giornalisti dell'epoca come un suggello della storia d'amore fra la cantante e il musicista". Digitalizzato per la prima volta nel CD "Mina Notre Etoile" (MBO\, 1999) che raccoglie le incisioni in lingua francese del periodo Italdisc (58-63).	0
COL title VAL Ils s'aiment COL performer VAL Catherine Lara & Richard Cocciante	COL video title VAL Betty Johnson -- I Need You Now (VintageMusic.es) COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Betty Johnson 16 de marzo 1929 (otras fuentes dicen 1931)  es una cantante norteamericana que alcanzó su pico de carrera en la década de 1950. Cuando era adolescente\, fue contratada por Columbia Records e hizo algunas grabaciones\, ninguna de las cuales tuvieron éxito. En 1951\, Percy Faith \, que la había conocido por sus grabaciones de Columbia\, trató de convencer a Mitch Miller ( A & R\, el director de Columbia) para firmar con ella\, pero Miller\, que incluye Doris Day y Rosemary Clooney \, entre los artistas que habían firmado\, no veía la necesidad firmar con ella.  Johnson lanzó el álbum para niños\, con Eddy Arnold producido por Simon and Schuster \, que posteriormente la contrató para su propio sello discográfico\, Bell Records en 1954. En el mismo año firmó un contrato con Csida-Grean\, una sociedad de gestión que había manejado la carrera de Arnold. Charles Grean\, miembro  de esa compañía\,  produjo muchas de sus grabaciones posteriores. En 1955\, firmó un contrato con RCA Victor Records \, que la envió a Chicago\, Illinois .  En Chicago\, Johnson trabajó con Arnold de nuevo en su  serie\, Eddy Arnold Time\, respaldado por un grupo que había trabajado con su familia en el Grand Ole Opry\, The Jordanaires . Este grupo más tarde fue conocido como un grupo de apoyo de Elvis Presley .  En 1957 se casó con Grean\, aunque el matrimonio sólo duraría hasta 1961\, la relación profesional continuó. Luego fue contratada por Jack Paar para su programa de televisión\, Tonight . Esto condujo a un contrato discográfico con Atlantic Records en 1957\, para el que tuvo su próximo gran éxito\, "Little Blue Man".  Johnson continuó en Tonight hasta 1962 cuando Jack Paar fue reemplazado por Johnny Carson.

Join our Youtube: https://goo.gl/8AOGaN Join our Facebook: http://goo.gl/5oL723 Robert Leroy Johnson (May 8\, 1911 -- August 16\, 1938 ) was an American blues singer and musician. His landmark recordings from 1936--37 display a combination of singing\, guitar skills\, and songwriting talent that has influenced later generations of musicians. Johnson's shadowy\, poorly documented life and death at age 27 have given rise to much legend\, including the Faustian myth that he sold his soul at a crossroads to achieve success. As an itinerant performer who played mostly on street corners\, in juke joints\, and at Saturday night dances\, Johnson had little commercial success or public recognition in his lifetime.

COL title VAL Head Like a Hole COL performer VAL Lullacry	COL video title VAL Hello Stranger - The Supremes & The Four Tops COL channel name VAL MotownConnoisseur30 COL description VAL Here is another outstanding cover from the third duet album from The Supremes & The Four Tops entitled "Dynamite" from 1971.  Aside from Barbara Lewis' 1963 original\, I think this version is the best of all the covers ever done of the song. It is musical perfection.  Written by: Barbara Lewis Produced by: Bobby Taylor and Frank Wilson Track recorded: May 3\, 1971 Additional overdubs\, strings and horn sessions recorded in Los Angeles: Dates unknown Levi Stubbs lead vocal recorded: June 5\, 1971 & August 17\, 1971 Four Tops background vocals recorded: June 9\, 1971 Jean Terrell lead vocal recorded: June 10\, 1971 Supremes background vocals recorded: June 24\, 1971  This version is the best song on the entire LP and one of the best duets the groups did together over the three albums. Motown was foolish not to release this as a single. It screams hit and would have been one had Motown promoted it\, but at the time The Supremes and The Four Tops were no longer Motown's top priority. Nonetheless\, it still remains an incredible cover.  ****No copyright infringement intended****	0

COL title VAL In Memory of Elizabeth Reed COL performer VAL The Allman Brothers Band	COL video title VAL The Animals It's My Life COL channel name VAL top401965 COL description VAL NO COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT INTENDED. COPYRIGHTS RESERVED BY COPYRIGHT OWNER.This video is used only for non-profit usage and publishing. The Animals were an English music group of the 1960s formed in Newcastle upon Tyne during the early part of the decade\, and later relocated to London. Known for their gritty\, bluesy  sound and deep-voiced frontman Eric Burdon -- as exemplified by their number one signature song "The House of the Rising Sun" as well as by hits such as "We Gotta Get Out of This Place" and "It's My Life" -- the band balanced tough\, rock-edged pop singles against rhythm and blues-oriented album material. They became known in the U.S. as part of the British Invasion.  The Animals underwent numerous personnel changes in the mid-1960s and suffered from poor business management. Under the name Eric Burdon and the Animals\, they moved to California and achieved commercial success as a psychedelic rock band\, before disbanding at the end of the decade. Altogether\, the group had ten Top Twenty hits in both the UK and U.S.  The original lineup had a brief comeback in 1977 and 1983. There have been several partial regroupings of the original era members since then under various names. The Animals were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.	0

COL title VAL Queen of Hearts COL performer VAL Juice Newton	COL video title VAL MELINDA SCHNEIDER & BECCY COLE Queen of Hearts COL channel name VAL daveinprogress3 COL description VAL A Mother's Day tribute utilising the fabulous Australian country singers Melinda Schneider and Beccy Cole who are two of the nation's pre-eminent singers who came together to record an album of classic female country songs with the apt title 'Great Women of Country and the Songs that Made them'.  With very different vocal tones and style\, Beccy and Melinda do great justice to a generous amount of iconic tracks on their duet album. I chose this recording\, as the best known (although not the original) version by Juice Newton is pretty hard to top. but these two ladies give it a red hot go! I love the unique qualities they bring to this set\, and they seem to be having a great old time doing it\, as well. They filmed a very cute vid for their version of '9 to 5' - check it out - it gives people a sense of the performers and their great approach. Melinda is the daughter of yodelling superstar Mary Schneider\, and Beccy's mum Carole Sturtzel was regarded as the Queen of Country Music in South Australia. For me it is a lovely opportunity here to be able to post a clip of these two wonderful daughters and celebrate the terrific careers they have both carved out for themselves. Both have multiple Golden Guitar awards (Australia's Country Music Prizes) and have scored many hits from their already prolific catalogues.   Happy Mother's Day to all the wonderful Mums out there.	1

COL title VAL Who's Loving You COL performer VAL Brenda Holloway	COL video title VAL NYSF Threepenny Opera - 07 - Liebeslied (Look at the Moon over Soho) COL channel name VAL AnonNietzsche COL description VAL This is an LP transfer of the 1976 New York Shakespeare Festival's revival production of "The Threepenny Opera."  This recording should not be confused with the original 1954 New York production recording\, nor the 1994 Donmar Warehouse production recording in England.  Unlike Marc Blitzstein's version which ran during the 1950's for six years and featured the incomparable Lotte Lenya\, this translation is less sanitized and more in keeping with the seedy and sexual nature of the original german play.    From the liner notes to the album - "the successful Blitzstein version was an adaptation rather than a translation\, and in comparing it to the original\, we were surprised at the extent to which his treatment vitiated the political and sexual thrust which gives the work its relentless power.  Blitzstein sweetened and cleaned up Brecht's unsparing lyrics\, partially in deference to stage censorship...but in doing so he in many instances changed Brecht's meanings around entirely\, and throughout he softened the impact of Brecht's biting ferocity.  He also attempted to make the lyrics more 'singable' by fitting them into conventional musical patterns\, and in this he succeeded admirably."  The translation used for this revival was prepared by Ralph Maheim and John Willett; the full text can be found in their edition of Brecht's Collected Plays\, Volume 2.  A hardcover edition was also published in conjunction with the revival.  This revival was directed by conceptual theater artist Richard Foreman\, and starred Raul Julia and Ellen Greene\, both of whom were nominated for Tony Awards.  It was produced by Joseph Papp and the New York Shakespeare Festival at the Vivian Beaumont Theatre at Lincoln Center.  Additional information regarding the production\, including cast list\, can be found at the Internet Broadway Database's listing for this revival at http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=3835 ...  As of June 2007\, this cast album has not been released or reissued on CD; it was originally made available in 1976 on LP\, and this is an LP transfer.  As such\, the quality is not CD quality  - there will occasionally be noise\, popping\, or hissing.

The dust has only just begun to fall\, Crop circles in the carpet\, sinking\, feeling. Spin me 'round again and rub my eyes. This can't be happening. When busy streets amass with people Would stop to hold their heads heavy.  Hide and seek. Trains and sewing machines. All those years they were here first.  Oily marks appear on walls Where pleasure moments hung before. The takeover\, the sweeping insensitivity of this still life.  Hide and seek. Trains and sewing machines. (Oh\, you won't catch me around here) Blood and tears (hearts)\, They were here first.  Mmm\, what you say? Mm\, that you only meant well? Well\, of course you did. Mmm\, what you say? Mm\, that it's all for the best? Of course it is. Mmm\, what you say? Mm\, that it's just what we need? And you decided this. What you say? Mmm\, what did She say?  Ransom notes keep falling out your mouth. Mid-sweet talk\, newspaper word cut-outs. Speak no feeling\, no I don't believe you. You don't care a bit. You don't care a bit.  (hide and seek) Ransom notes keep falling out your mouth. Mid-sweet talk\, newspaper word cut-outs. (hide and seek) Speak no feeling\, no I don't believe you. You don't care a bit. You don't care a bit.  (hide and seek) You don't care a bit. You don't care a bit. You don't care a bit. (hide and seek) You don't care a bit.

Joey DeFrancesco Composed: Sam Jones Cd: "Like That"\, Recording Date: August 30\, 1995 - August 31\, 1995  Release Date: April 30\, 1996   Subscribe Here: http://www.youtube.com/user/TheSouLighting http://www.facebook.com/thesoulighting  Jimmy Bruno\, born July 22\, 1953 in Philadelphia\, Pennsylvania\, is a master jazz guitarist and jazz educator. He started playing at the age of 7. He began his professional career at the age of 19\, touring with Buddy Rich. Among his many credits\, he is the only guitarist to have ever led Frank Sinatra's band. He played for many years in Los Angeles before returning to the Philadelphia area. He counts Johnny Smith\, Hank Garland\, Joe Pass\, Tal Farlow\, Wes Montgomery\, Howard Roberts\, Jim Hall\, and Pat Martino amongst his influences. In March\, 2011 Jimmy opened up Jimmy Bruno's Guitar Workshop\, a website that allows students to learn directly from Jimmy through video lessons.  For more information: http://jimmybruno.com/biography.php  Although Like That was recorded in New York\, many of the people involved with the project were Philadelphians. The pleasing hard bop date unites Jimmy Bruno's Philly-based trio of the 1990s (which includes bassist Craig Thomas and drummer Steve Holloway) with organist/trumpeter and Philly native Joey DeFrancesco\, Although DeFrancesco plays organ on most of the 11 songs\, he switches to the trumpet and favors a Miles Davis-influenced mute on relaxed versions of "There Is No Greater Love" and "Stars Fell on Alabama."   Ο Jimmy Bruno γεννήθηκε στις 22 Ιουλίου 1953\, στην Πενσυλβάνια και είναι ένας Αμερικανός master κιθαρίστας και διδάσκαλος της τζαζ. Παίζει από ηλικία 7 ετών και ξεκίνησε την επαγγελματική του καριέρα στην ηλικία των 19\, περιοδεύοντας με τον Buddy Rich. Μεταξύ των πολλών του διακρίσεων\, είναι ότι ήταν ο μόνος επικεφαλής κιθαρίστας της μπάντας του Frank Sinatra. Έπαιξε για πολλά χρόνια στο Λος Άντζελες πριν από την επιστροφή στην  Φιλαδέλφεια. Έχει επηρεαστεί\, μεταξύ άλλων\, από τους  Johnny Smith\, Hank Garland\, Joe Pass\, Tal Farlow\, Wes Montgomery\, Howard Roberts\, Jim Hall\, and Pat Martino. Από τον Μάρτιο του 2011\, άνοιξε την ιστοσελίδα: Jimmy Bruno's Guitar Workshop\,  που επιτρέπει στους μαθητές του να εξασκηθούν απευθείας από τον Bruno μέσω βίντεο μαθημάτων. Περισσότερες πληροφορίες: http://jimmybruno.com/biography.php  Το μουσικό κομμάτι “Unit Seven” είναι το από το cd του 1996 με τίτλο “Like That”\, που ηχογραφήθηκε στη Νέα Υόρκη και οι περισσότεροι μουσικοί ήταν από την Φιλαδέλφεια. Στο βασικό του τρίο (με μπάσσο τον Craig Thomas και ντράμμερ τον Steve Holloway) της περιόδου του 1990\, προστέθηκε ο  οργανίστας/τρομπετίστας Joey DeFrancesco (επίσης από την Φιλαδέλφεια).  Ο Joey DeFrancesco παίζει όργανο στα περισσότερα από τα 11 κομμάτια\, αλλά και τρομπέτα βαθειά επηρεασμένος από τον τρόπο του Miles Davis (κυρίως στα "There Is No Greater Love" και "Stars Fell on Alabama.")

COL title VAL It's Getting Better COL performer VAL Bobby Rydell	COL video title VAL VOGUES   IT'S GETTING BETTER 1968 Reprise Records    RS 6314 COL channel name VAL Amnondoowop COL description VAL It's Getting Better is a song written by Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil that was a sunshine pop hit single in 1969 for Cass Elliot.  The song describes the singer's satisfaction with a love relationship that is down-to-earth rather than extravagantly romantic\, a subgenre of love song exemplified by the Jerome Kern/ P. G. Wodehouse composition "Bill". Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil had previously written the similarly themed "He's Sure the Boy I Love"\, a hit for the Crystals in 1963.  "It's Getting Better" was first recorded by the Vogues for inclusion on their Reprise album\, TURN AROUND\, LOOK AT ME\, which was released by August\, 1968. The next version was one by Leonard Nimoy for his Dot Records lp\, THE WAY I FEEL. That was by October\, 1968. It was by March\, 1969 when The Will-O-Bees\, a New York City based trio (Janet Blossom\, Steven Porter\, and Robert Merchanthouse) who recorded a number of Mann-Weil compositions\, also had a single release of "It's Getting Better" on the SGC label (Screen Gems Columbia). The Mama Cass version happened by May\, 1969\, initially as a single advance release and then an album cut\, the single release referencing the album.  1969 saw the release of several single versions of "It's Getting Better" but only Cass Elliot's was by an established artist\, the other versions being by Ronnie Buskirk\, Freddie Gelfand\, and P. K. Limited. [1]  "It's Getting Better" had been recorded by Cass Elliot for inclusion on her June 1969 album release Bubble Gum\, Lemonade\, and... Something for Mama\, which was produced by Steve Barri and arranged by Jimmie Haskell. The Wrecking Crew (James Burton on guitar\, Hal Blaine on drums\, Larry Knechtel on keyboards\, and Joe Osborn on bass) — who'd regularly backed the Mamas & the Papas — were among the instrumentalists on the album.  "It's Getting Better" was issued as the second advance single in May 1969 following the release that March of "Move in a Little Closer\, Baby"\, a single reminiscent of the Mamas & the Papas sound which reached a Billboard Hot 100 peak of #58. Steve Barri says that "Move in a Little Closer\, Baby" was "one [album track] [Elliot] wasn't too thrilled about...but she loved 'It's Getting Better'".[2]  A #13 Easy Listening hit\, "It's Getting Better" reached #30 on the Hot 100.[3] It remained on the U.S. charts for 18 weeks.[4] The single's regional success was staggered\, and it reached the Top Ten in several markets\, ranking as high as #2 in Minneapolis-Saint Paul and San Diego.[5] Its estimated U.S. sales were 500\,000 copies.[4]  "It's Getting Better" had a more pronounced chart impact in the UK\, reaching #8 in October 1969 and selling almost 100\,000 copies\, despite a potential rival version by Paul Jones. The single bested the UK chart performance of Elliot's signature song\, "Dream a Little Dream of Me" (#11)\, which had lost some popularity to a rival version by Anita Harris. [6] [4]  "Dream a Little Dream of Me" and "It's Getting Better" would be Elliot's only two UK chart appearances. In the U.S.\, "It's Getting Better" was the fourth of Elliot's seven solo Billboard Hot 100 appearances and her second Top 40 hit after "Dream a Little Dream of Me".  In Australia "It's Getting Better" by Cass Elliott charted at #53.  In the wake of the success of "It's Getting Better"\, Elliot's next two singles were recordings of Barry Mann-Cynthia Weil compositions: "Make Your Own Kind of Music" — which like "It's Getting Better" had been recorded by the Will-O-Bees in 1968 — and a new song\, "New World Coming". Although both songs are now considered soft rock classics\, their original chart success was fairly mild: "Make Your Own Kind of Music" peaked at #36 (Elliot's third and final solo Top 40 appearance)\, and "New World Coming" peaked at #42.[7]  "It's Getting Better" has also been recorded by Richard Barnes\, New Cactus Band\, Louise Morrissey\, the Popinjays\, Kevin Rowland and John & Anne Ryder. Bobby Rydell made it in 1976 for Born With a Smile\, his sole album released after 1964.[1][7] Jane McDonald's rendition of "It's Getting Better" can be heard on her 2010 concert album Live at the London Palladium. A Swedish rendering of "It's Getting Better" by lyricist Stig Anderson entitled "Det Känns Bara Bättre" was cut by Anna-Lena Löfgren in 1970.  In 2011 Cass Elliot's "It's Getting Better" was employed in a television advertisement for Nestea.	1

Draper (25 enero 1923 hasta 28 marzo 2003)\,  conocido profesionalmente como Rusty Draper \, era un cantante americano de Pop que logró su mayor éxito en la década de 1950.  Nacido en Kirksville\, Missouri (el apodo de "Rusty" era por su pelo rojo) comenzó a actuar en el programa de radio de su tío en Tulsa \, Oklahoma a mediados de la década de 1930. Draper pasó a trabajar en las estaciones de radio en Des Moines \, Iowa  (veces tomando el lugar del locutor deportivo Ronald Reagan) \, y en Illinois antes de instalarse en California . Allí comenzó a cantar en  clubes \, convirtiéndose en el cantante oficial del casino de San Francisco . A principios de la década de 1950 había empezado a aparecer en programas de televisión nacionales\, incluyendo The Ed Sullivan Show (CBS) y Ozark Jubilee (ABC).  En 1952\, Draper firmó con Mercury Records y lanzó su primera grabación  \, "How Could You (ojos azules)". Al año siguiente\, después de una gira nacional de clubes\, su versión de  Jim Lowe's "Gambler's Guitar" 's llegó al N º 6 en las listas de éxitos de todo el paçis\, y vendió un millón de copias\, consiguiendo  un disco de oro.  Tras una serie de éxitos menores\, volvió a lo más alto en 1955 con "Seventeen" (N º 18)\, "El Shifting\, Whispering Sands" (N º 3) y "Are You Satisfied?" (No. 11)\, convirtiéndose en uno de los cantantes  de pop  con más éxito de la época.  En 1962\, firmó con con Monument Records \, con cada vez menos éxito en las listas ya que su estilo se fue quedando anticuado.

Thomas\, Bill Medley\, Chuck Leavell and Judith Hill  Ever since his glorious surprise version of “The Way You Look Tonight” in the 1991 film “Father of The Bride” paved the way for his extraordinary second career as a GRAMMY Award winning vocalist/producer\, Steve Tyrell has been setting A New Standard (the title of his 1999 debut album) for interpreting the Great American Songbook – most notably on Songs of Sinatra (which reached #5 on the Billboard Jazz Albums chart) and his most recent Concord Records release\, It’s Magic: The Songs of Sammy Cahn (#2). On his 11th album\, That Lovin’ Feeling\, he celebrates what he calls “the Great American Songbook 2; the next generation of the Songbook\,” recording seminal rock era classics penned by legendary songwriters (many renowned for hits penned at New York’s famed Brill Building) who are also cherished longtime friends.   While sharing the enduring magic of timeless songs by the songwriting teams of Carole King and Gerry Goffin\, Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller\, Barry Mann & Cynthia Weil and Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich as well as Burt Bacharach\, Neil Sedaka\, Toni Wine and Carole Bayer Sager\, That Lovin’ Feeling sets itself apart from most tribute recordings with spirited guest vocal appearances by Mann\, B.J. Thomas\, Neil Sedaka and Bill Medley in addition to renowned backup singer Judith Hill (featured in the Oscar winning documentary “20 Feet From Stardom”) and Tyrell’s daughter Lauryn Tyrell. The set also includes key instrumental contributions by Stoller\, keyboardist Chuck Leavell\, saxophonist Dave Koz and even playful hand claps by Jeff Barry.	0

COL title VAL Hello Stranger COL performer VAL Carrie Lucas	COL video title VAL 1913 Massacre Ramblin' Jack Elliott COL channel name VAL leanannsidhe COL description VAL 1913 Massacre American Folk Tales Ramblin' Jack Elliot  The 1913 Massacre is based on an event that took place just as the song says in Calumet\, Michigan on December 24\, 1913. It is always known as the Italian Hall Disaster. The strike that led up to this was one of the longest\, most dangerous strikes that took place in Michigan. The song refers to copper country which is the upper peninsula of Michigan.  The miners were striking for better pay\, shortened work days and safer working conditions. Worker's pay was based on the depth of penetration into the mines made by his group that day. The mine was switching to using a one man drill\, the mechanical drill cutting cost for the mines. However it broke up the family groups that worked in the mines together and cut many jobs. Most workers made around $2.75 a day for 10 - 12 hours a day.   The strike had been going on for 5 months. The striking miners and their families had gathered at the Italian Hall for a Christmas party. It is thought that there were five hundred people at the party. The building had a steep staircase and the party was being held on the second floor. There was a fire escape\, however as was common at the time\, it was poorly marked\, poorly lit\, and could only be reached by climbing through the window. Someone yelled "fire" and in the panic that followed 73 people were killed. Over half of the people killed were children between the ages of six and ten.  The investigations that followed produced no culprit. Part of the problem was victims who did not speak English were questioned and forced to answer in English. In other cases witnesses were not questioned at all. It was and still is commonly thought that out of town strike breakers\, funded by mine management\, were the ones that yelled fire.  The Italian Hall has since been demolished\, and only the archway remains from that day. A state historical markers marks the spot and date.	0

In most English versions of the song the basic story is that of a condemned maiden pleading for someone to buy her freedom from the executioner. It is thought the versions collected by Mr. Child were incomplete and that the most extensive complete version is a story and not a song at all. A fairy story called "The Golden Ball" The following link lead to the story and you can compare for yourself.  http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/eng/meft/meft04.htm  This is Lead Belly's rendition. It is a mixture of singing and spoken word\, and amazing guitar picking and playing.	0

I'm adding this to clear up some misinformation about this song....  Clinton "Dusty" Fletcher was an African-American vaudeville performer. He created the "Open The Door Richard" routine. It was Jack McVea who put the routine to music and recorded it. It became a huge hit in the late 1940s and was covered by many different bands.

I am posting "Hello Stranger"\, as it is not one of her bigger chart successes\, but it does showcase her wonderful voice and it is a very seventies take on the 60's Barbara Lewis classic.  35 years ago\, "Love me"\, written by the Bee Gees\, was a breakout hit for Yvonne\, giving her a worldwide hit\, including Australia\, where it would ascend the charts and reach #4 in the late summer of 1977. "Hello Stranger" was discovered by me\, once again courtesy of a Various Artist compile - the sexy styled "Ripper 77" with the curvaceous cheeks of a woman adorned with lipstick writing of the names of the 20 original artists featured on the record.  "Hello Stranger"\, like several of the hits on this compile\, was not a hit in Australia\, but three and a half decades later\, it is a fondly considered musical postcard from the era\, and i am eternally grateful to the record companies for releasing those compilations\, even if some of the inclusions were bizarre and obscure.  Back in the halcyon days of the late 1970's\, radio airplay and tv shows like "Countdown" and "Sounds Unlimited" were the few outlets for songs to receive exposure. So many fine recordings were simply overlooked\, because of the few opportunities for visibility or audibility at the time.   1978 would be the major year for Yvonne with another Gibb brothers extravaganza giving her the biggest success of her career with the #1 smash "If I can't have you"\, from  the pop & disco juggernaut "Saturday Night Fever". Another movie soundtrack "Moment by Moment" also starring John Travolta\, would see another recording by Yvonne Elliman - the title track\, but the gentle ballad could not break through the endless litany of disco hits that monopolised 1979. Her own "Love Pains" was her final hit from that part of her career\, and it is a much loved and much covered anthem from the disco era.  I hope "Hello Stranger" gives whoever hears it\, the joy that it has given me.	0

The record is over 50 years old and has a high amount of surface noise. The extreme detail of the music can be heard\, despite the surface noise.  I've been working to reduce surface noise pickup and have exhausted all the techniques I know of to reduce that noise. That AT92ECD cartridge I use has a .3 X .7 mil stylus and my pre amp system makes no compromises in high frequency response or low noise performance\, so I would especially appreciate suggestions from anyone who may be able to hear and point me to it's cause. Thank you.  UPDATE: 1/14/2012 I've worked up a satisfactory deep-groove cleaning system. I'll be posting very clean records soon and plan to produce a video about my wacky method.

COL title VAL Houston COL performer VAL Dean Martin	COL video title VAL PETER PAUL AND MARY CD Vintage Folk. If I Had A hammer \, 500 Miles \, Lemon Tree COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Peter\, Paul and Mary (también llamado PP&M) fue uno de los grupos musicales estadounidenses de música folk más exitosos de la década de 1960. Estaba compuesto por Peter Yarrow\, Paul Stookey y Mary Travers.  En 1962 iniciaron su carrera musical con su primer disco llamado Peter\,Paul & Mary. En las décadas anteriores de los 60s la música folk fue identificada por artistas como Woody Guthrie o Pete Seeger.Cuando Peter\, Paul y Mary llegaron a la escena\, para la mayoría de América\, folk era visto sólo como una barra lateral a la música pop que empleó instrumentos acústicos.  En esta coyuntura histórica crítica\, con el país todavía se está recuperando de la era de McCarthy\, el Movimiento de los Derechos Civiles a tomar forma\, la guerra fría y calentar un espíritu naciente de activismo en el aire; Peter Yarrow\, Noel Stookey (Paul) y Mary Travers vino junto a yuxtaponer estas corrientes cruzadas y así recuperar la potencia popular como fuerza social\, cultural y político. Pero pocos a la vez podría haber dado cuenta de lo penetrante fervor y el mensaje del grupo de la humanidad\, la esperanza y activismo se abrazaron.  Tener su música asociada con causas y soluciones es tan natural como respirar para Peter\, Paul y Mary. La música y la acción que genera son igualmente importantes para ellos y están en el corazón de su historia. Más recientemente\, sus esfuerzos individuales y colectivos se han centrado en temas tan cruciales como la violencia armada contra los niños\, los derechos de las y los esfuerzos de organización de los recolectores de fresas en California\, la indigencia y el hambre mundial.  Ningún grupo folk americano ha durado más o acumulado muchos seguidores más leales que Peter\, Paul and Mary\, de hecho\, algunos grupos de cualquier género han registrado más años (45) o millas (incontables) gira en directo\, anualmente\, la difusión del mensaje y la participación los siguientes (ahora cuatro) generaciones. Durante su carrera legendaria\, el trío ganó cinco premios Grammy\, produjo 13 Top 40 hits\, 6 de las cuales subió a los Top 10 - así como ocho de oro y cinco discos de platino. Eso PP & M alcanzado tal nivel enrarecido de éxito comercial sin compromiso y sin dejar una tradición centenaria de las personas que levantan sus voces en una canción por el bien de la libertad\, es simplemente una prueba más de su extraordinariamente exitosa carrera tanto una misión cumplida como una carrera musical.

COL title VAL The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald COL performer VAL Gordon Lightfoot	COL video title VAL Ruth Brown - Never Let Me Go COL channel name VAL sanny blues COL description VAL A Good Day For The Blues ....Ruth Brown (1928-2006) was a rhythm & blues singer-songwriter\, record producer\, composer and actress noted for bringing a pop music style to rhythm & blues music. Backed by a bevy of New Orleans jazz and soul vets\, Brown delivers a series of horn-inflected\, indigo ballads like "Never Let Me Go\," "True\," and "The Richest One" that unearth the blues with an unruffled dignity reminiscent of Nina Simone or a less fragile Billie Holiday. On most of the rest of the material\, Brown invokes her Broadway experience to become the archetypal blues mama who "don't take no mess." In that vein\, "H.B.'s Funky Fable" is a humorous talk-sung tale for kids of all ages\, and "Cabbage Head" resurrects the minstrel-vaudeville days of Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith with hilarious aplomb\, as Brown nails the bawdy vernacular and trumpeter Abram Wilson spools out brassy asides that evoke the period perfectly.	0

COL title VAL Everyday Will Be Like a Holiday COL performer VAL Curtis Salgado and The Stilettos	COL video title VAL Joan of Arc (Leonard Cohen) - Allison Crowe w. lyrics COL channel name VAL Allison Crowe COL description VAL On her debut album "secrets" Allison Crowe covers this Leonard Cohen song. Her voice and piano is accompanied by Jo Lundstrom (Rosehip Jam\, Black Velvet Band) on accordion. Crowe engineered the recording\, with production by Rainer Willeke (of Victoria\, B.C.'s Raindog Studios).  http://music.allisoncrowe.com/track/joan-of-arc  The photo of Allison Crowe is by Billie Woods.  MOJO magazine's December '08 issue paid tribute to "Rock's Greatest Poet" Leonard Cohen with a celebration of his "deep and moving music". Of Allison Crowe's contribution of "Joan of Arc" to its 'All Star Tribute"\, (featuring Judy Collins\, Nick Cave\, Katie Melua\, Martha Wainwright\, Dion and others)\, a cover-mount CD titled "Cohen Covered"\, MOJO says: "Once famously described by the Vancouver Courier as possessing a style akin to 'Elton John meets Edith Piaf'\, the Canadian singer-songwriter Allison Crowe is renowned for her ability to blend control and melodrama. Certainly she does so on this spirited cover of Cohen's 'Songs of Love and Hate' classic\, a track which also powerfully showcases her considerable talent as a fine interpreter of song."  "Any album that features a track from Leonard Cohen is certainly heading in the right direction. But when it is covered so beautifully\, it makes you realise what an amazing lyricist Leonard Cohen is. Joan of Arc is the Cohen song covered on this album and it's certainly in my top 10 of Cohen covers. It's also my favorite track on (Secrets)" ~ Colin Meeks\, indielaunchpad.com (USA)  Joan of Arc  Words & Music by Leonard Cohen As performed by Allison Crowe  Now the flames they followed Joan of Arc as she came riding through the dark; no moon to keep her armour bright\, no man to get her through this dark and smoky night.   She said\, "I'm tired of the war\, I want the kind of work I had before\, A wedding dress or something white to wear upon my swollen appetite."  Well\, I'm glad to hear you talk this way\, I've watched you riding every day and there is something in me that yearns to win such a cold\, such a lonesome heroine.  "And who are you?" she sternly spoke to the one beneath the smoke. "Why\, I'm fire\," he replied\, "And I love your solitude\, I love your pride."  "Well\, then\, fire make your body cold\, I'm going to give you mine to hold." And saying this she climbed inside to be his one\, to be his only bride.  Then deep into his fiery heart he took the dust of Joan of Arc\, and high above all these wedding guests he hung the ashes of her lovely wedding dress.  It was deep into his fiery heart he took the dust of Joan of Arc\, and then she clearly understood if he was fire\, oh\, she must be wood.  I saw her wince\, I saw her cry\, I saw the glory in her eye. Myself I long for love and light\, but must it come so cruel\,  must it be so bright?	0

COL title VAL Outer Limits COL performer VAL The Iguanas	COL video title VAL Henry Mancini -   Tiny Bubbles COL channel name VAL Socratess2007 COL description VAL "I think there is a song out there to describe just about any situation."― Criss Jami ▼▼▼  HENRY MANCINI Enrico Nicola "Henry" Mancini was an American composer\, arranger and conductor\, who is best remembered for his film and television scores.  He won a record number of Grammy Awards\, plus a posthumous Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995. His best-known works include the jazz-idiom theme to The Pink Panther film series ("The Pink Panther Theme") and the theme to the Peter Gunn television series.  Mancini had a long collaboration with the film director Blake Edwards and won numerous Academy Awards for the songs in Edwards films\, including "Moon River" from Breakfast at Tiffany's\, "Days of Wine and Roses" and for the score to "Victor Victoria". Entering 1946\, Mancini became a pianist and arranger for the newly re-formed Glenn Miller Orchestra\, led by 'Everyman' Tex Beneke. After World War II\, Mancini broadened his skills in composition\, counterpoint\, harmony and orchestration during studies opening with the composers Ernst Krenek and Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco.  In 1952\, Mancini joined the Universal Pictures music department. During the next six years\, he contributed music to over 100 movies\, most notably The Creature from the Black Lagoon\, It Came from Outer Space\, Tarantula\, This Island Earth\, The Glenn Miller Story (for which he received his first Academy Award nomination)\, The Benny Goodman Story and Orson Welles' Touch of Evil. During this time\, he also wrote some popular songs. His first hit was a single by Guy Lombardo and His Royal Canadians titled I Won't Let You Out of My Heart. Mancini left Universal to work as an independent composer/arranger in 1958. Soon after\, he scored the television series Peter Gunn for writer/producer Blake Edwards. This was the genesis of a relationship in which Edwards and Mancini collaborated on 30 films over 35 years.  Along with Alex North\, Elmer Bernstein\, Leith Stevens and Johnny Mandel\, Henry Mancini was a pioneer of the inclusion of jazz elements in the late romantic orchestral film and TV scoring prevalent at the time. Mancini scored many TV movies\, including The Thorn Birds and The Shadow Box. He wrote many television themes\, including Mr. Lucky (starring John Vivyan and Ross Martin)\, NBC Mystery Movie\, What's Happening\, Tic Tac Dough (1990 version) and Once Is Not Enough. In the 1984--85 television season\, four series featured original Mancini themes: Newhart\, Hotel\, Remington Steele\, and Ripley's Believe It or Not. Mancini also composed the "Viewer Mail" theme for Late Night with David Letterman. Mancini composed the theme for NBC Nightly News used beginning in 1975\, and a different theme by him\, titled Salute to the President was used by NBC News for its election coverage (including primaries and conventions) from 1976 to 1992. Salute to the President was only published in a school-band arrangement\, although Mancini performed it frequently with symphony orchestras on his concert tours. Songs with music by Mancini were staples of the easy listening genre from the 1960s to the 1980s. Some of the artists who have recorded Mancini songs include Andy Williams\, Paul Anka\, Pat Boone\, Anita Bryant\, Jack Jones\, Frank Sinatra\, Perry Como\, Connie Francis\, Eydie Gorme\, Steve Lawrence\, Trini Lopez\, George Maharis\, Johnny Mathis\, Jerry Vale and Ray Conniff\, to name just a few.... Mancini recorded over 90 albums\, in styles ranging from big band to light classical to pop. Eight of these albums were certified gold by The Recording Industry Association of America. He had a 20-year contract with RCA Records\, resulting in 60 commercial record albums that made him a household name among artists of easy-listening music.  TINY BUBBLES "Tiny Bubbles" is a song written by Martin Denny and Leon Pober. It was released in 1966 by Don Ho.  It is widely considered to be Denny's most famous song.  MHO "Tiny Bubbles" is -\, with all due respect for Mr Denny\, a rather "simple" song but... hand the notes to a top arranger like Henry Mancini and .... what you get is a fabulous orchestral arrangement that\, in a way\, transforms the song into an easy floating ballad.  A particularly rich instrumentation with strings\, brass\, and all the other "standard" instruments of a large orchestra\, completed with the sound of the ukelele and harp\, so typical for the Hawaiian style music.  The Mancini chorus adds some warmth and "body" to the recording\, so\, in the end\, we get to hear a splendid version of this well known theme.   Have a great (musical) trip to "Aloha country" :) !  Enjoy.	0

COL title VAL Since You Been Gone COL performer VAL Rainbow	COL video title VAL Maddox Brothers & Rose - No Help Wanted COL channel name VAL HillbillyBoogie1 COL description VAL The Maddox Brothers and Rose\, known as America's Most Colorful Hillbilly Band from the 1930s to the 1950s\, consisted of four brothers\, Fred\, Cal\, Cliff and Don Maddox\, along with their sister Rose. Cliff died in 1949 and was replaced by brother Henry. The group disbanded in 1956.  The family hailed from Boaz\, Alabama\, but rode the rails and hitch hiked to California in 1933 when the band members were still children\, following the failed efforts of their sharecropper parents during the early part of the Depression. They were a little in advance of the flood of Okies who were to flood the state in the 30s. They struggled to make a living as intinerant fruit and vegetable pickers following the harvest as far north as Washington state\, and as far east as Arizona\, as well as in the San Joaquin Valley. They often worked from dawn to dusk\, sleeping and eating on the ground.  Having settled in Modesto\, the family developed their musical ability and\, in 1937 performed on the radio\, sponsored by a local furniture store. In 1939 they entered a hillbilly band competition at the centenial Sacramento State Fair after driving to Sacramento in their Model A. When they took the stage they tore through "Sally Let Your Bangs Hang Down" with rocking rhythms and risque lyrics. They became\, officially\, California's best hillbilly band.  The brothers and Rose appeared at places such as the 97th Street Corral in Los Angles.  From 1946-1951 the group recorded for 4 Star Records (Hollywood)\, then for Columbia Records. Some 4 Star masters were leased and released by US.-Decca Records at the beginning of the 1950s. The following quotes are from Rose Maddox. "We were called hillbilly singers - not country - then. No\, none of this country music then. People just called us hillbilly... People tell me that I was one of the first women to sing what I sang - country boogie. I guess I was. There was no rock 'n' roll in those early days\, before 1955. Only country boogie. My brothers also played that way. We called it country then.  The Maddox's material ranged from the country standards of Hank Williams and Merle Travis\, cowboy songs\, to the Western swing of Bob Wills\, to old-time\, folk\, and church singing\, to jazz\, swing\, boogie woogie and even a taste of early rock and roll.  Fred Maddox played upright bass using the "slap bass" technique as early as 1937.[5] This trademark backbeat\, a slapping bass style\, helped drive a broad change in popular music\, sporting a faster\, immediately discernible rhythm that came to be known as rockabilly.  Fred Maddox's bass is displayed at the Experience Music Project in Seattle. "They wanted his bass because they believe he might have hit the first note of rock 'n' roll on it.	0

COL title VAL Love Is Stronger Far Than We COL performer VAL Lana Cantrell	COL video title VAL ELIO PACE - I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues (from the album 'Come And Get It' 2002) 8of 16 COL channel name VAL rosarecordsonline COL description VAL 'I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues' was written by Elton John\, Bernie Taupin and Davey Johnstone and was originally recorded by Elton John.  _________________________  A message from Elio...  The original concept behind 'Come And Get It'\, was to produce a high quality demo for me and my band to use as promotion with a view to attracting bigger and better corporate work as a 'covers band'. It was never intended for commercial release. Proving this point\, the original two-thousand CDs pressed in February 2002\, had no barcode on the artwork.  In fact\, the idea (going into the first day of recording) was to record only segments of 10 or 12 songs and to create a five-minute showreel. It was only just as recording was about to commence that Darren Loveday (one of two guitarists in the band at the time and my co-producer on the project) suggested that for the time it took to decide which segment of each song should be recorded\, we may as well play the whole song from start to finish\, especially as we all knew the songs so well\, having played them so many times. It was only when listening back the following day to the 13-tracks we'd recorded\, that Darren and I decided to create a full album of the material.  It was also decided that along with the 13 'new' songs\, we should make use of the 74-minutes available on CD (at the time) and include; a previous demo we'd made in 1998 of Billy Joel's 'My Life'; a live stereo recording (off MiniDisc\, with a few overdubs) of Jerry Lee Lewis' 'Great Balls Of Fire' from August 2000; and demos of three original songs I'd written (Addicted To The Phone\, Got The Bug Back and Katy Likes House) which would eventually be re-recorded and released on my 2009 'debut' album\, 'A Seat At My Table.  The last item that we decided to include on this original 19-track album was a 1998 demo we had recorded of Delbert McClinton's 'Two More Bottles Of Wine'. Ironically\, it was THIS little track (with just myself on piano\, Darren on guitar and the both of us doing the backing vocals and hand-claps) that realised the original concept for this album and opened a huge door for me in my career. Sir Terry Wogan and the late Paul Walters\, working together on BBC Radio 2's 'Wake Up To Wogan'\, played my version of 'Two More Bottles Of Wine' on their show\, once a week for six-months\, from August 2003. It was the first time that one of my recordings had been played on national radio in the UK. I really wasn't prepared for it as I didn't even have a website at the time.  I eventually got my act together and although casually stocked in a hand-full of small record shops\, 'Come And Get It' (on my own label\, Rosa Records) became available to buy in 2005 on CD via my website and then released to the general public as a download in 2007. This digital release and the subsequent CD pressings does not include the three demos of my songs... for obvious reasons. Now discontinued\, you would have to hunt down one of the original batch of those two-thousand CDs pressed in February 2002.  By the way\, the billing as 'The Elio Pace Band' was purely to guarantee that prospective clients knew that they were not booking just an individual at a piano and to differentiate between my two 'hats' as a performer; a) playing 'dance party' covers and b) playing my own material\, for which I would simply be known as Elio Pace. Interestingly\, Terry Wogan never once announced my record as 'The Elio Pace Band'. Instead he always referred to me as "Elio Pace and his band". 'Come And Get It' was the first and only album that will have 'The Elio Pace Band' as the artist name although I fully expect to record another album of covers sometime in the future.  _________________________  Track listing:  1.

With very different vocal tones and style\, Beccy and Melinda do great justice to a generous amount of iconic tracks on their duet album. I chose this recording\, as the best known (although not the original) version by Juice Newton is pretty hard to top. but these two ladies give it a red hot go! I love the unique qualities they bring to this set\, and they seem to be having a great old time doing it\, as well. They filmed a very cute vid for their version of '9 to 5' - check it out - it gives people a sense of the performers and their great approach. Melinda is the daughter of yodelling superstar Mary Schneider\, and Beccy's mum Carole Sturtzel was regarded as the Queen of Country Music in South Australia. For me it is a lovely opportunity here to be able to post a clip of these two wonderful daughters and celebrate the terrific careers they have both carved out for themselves. Both have multiple Golden Guitar awards (Australia's Country Music Prizes) and have scored many hits from their already prolific catalogues.   Happy Mother's Day to all the wonderful Mums out there.	0

He performed in a range of music genres\, including pop\, rock'n'roll\, folk\, and country.    He started as a songwriter for Connie Francis\, and recorded his own first million-seller "Splish Splash" in 1958.

In 1962\, he won a Golden Globe for his first film Come September\, co-starring his first wife\, Sandra Dee.    Throughout the 1960s\, he became more politically active and worked on Robert Kennedy's Democratic presidential campaign. He was present on the night of June 4/5\, 1968\, at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles at the time of Kennedy's assassination. The same year\, he discovered that he had been brought up by his grandmother\, not his mother\, and that the girl he had thought to be his sister was actually his mother.

COL title VAL Jardin d'hiver COL performer VAL Ima	COL video title VAL Bill Keith Homestead on The Farm COL channel name VAL Marcus Brazil COL description VAL William Bradford Keith was born in Boston\, Massachusetts. He attended Amherst College and graduated in 1961. In 1963 he became a member of Bill Monroe's Bluegrass Boys.   Keith's recordings and performances during these nine months with Monroe permanently altered banjo playing\, and his style has become an important part of the playing styles of many banjoists. After leaving the Bluegrass Boys\, he joined "Jim Kweskin Jug Band" playing plectrum banjo. He began playing the steel guitar and soon after 1968\, found himself working together with Ian and Sylvia and Jonathan Edwards. In the 1970s Keith recorded for Rounder Records. Over the years he has performed with several other musicians\, such as Clarence White and David Grisman in Muleskinner\, Tony Trischka\, Jim Rooney and Jim Collier. Today\, Keith style is still regarded as modern or progressive in the context of bluegrass banjo playing.    Keith made a mechanical contribution to the banjo\, as well. He designed a specialized type of banjo tuning peg that facilitates changing quickly from one open tuning to another\, while playing. Earlier famed banjoist Earl Scruggs had designed a set of cams which were added to the banjo to perform this task. Keith's invention made the extra hardware unnecessary\, replacing two of the tuning machines already on the banjo — a more elegant solution. Scruggs himself became a partner in the venture for a while\, and the product was known as "Scruggs-Keith Pegs". Known today simply as Keith Pegs\, they remain the state of the art\, and Bill Keith continues to manufacture and market them personally as the primary product of his own company\, the Beacon Banjo Company.	0

The dust has only just begun to fall\, Crop circles in the carpet\, sinking\, feeling. Spin me 'round again and rub my eyes. This can't be happening. When busy streets amass with people Would stop to hold their heads heavy.  Hide and seek. Trains and sewing machines. All those years they were here first.  Oily marks appear on walls Where pleasure moments hung before. The takeover\, the sweeping insensitivity of this still life.  Hide and seek. Trains and sewing machines. (Oh\, you won't catch me around here) Blood and tears (hearts)\, They were here first.  Mmm\, what you say? Mm\, that you only meant well? Well\, of course you did. Mmm\, what you say? Mm\, that it's all for the best? Of course it is. Mmm\, what you say? Mm\, that it's just what we need? And you decided this. What you say? Mmm\, what did She say?  Ransom notes keep falling out your mouth. Mid-sweet talk\, newspaper word cut-outs. Speak no feeling\, no I don't believe you. You don't care a bit. You don't care a bit.  (hide and seek) Ransom notes keep falling out your mouth. Mid-sweet talk\, newspaper word cut-outs. (hide and seek) Speak no feeling\, no I don't believe you. You don't care a bit.

Lê plays in the tradition of Hendrix without directly copying him\, being creative and stretching himself. The occasional vocals by drummer Terri Lyne Carrington\, Aïda Khann\, and Corin Curschellas (which are sometimes spoken as much as sung) are unfortunately not as interesting and are mostly distracting. Bassist Michel Alibo is excellent during his solos and Lê shows originality in his improvisations\, but the music overall is more heartfelt than essential\, particularly since Hendrix's own records are easily available.  Recorded at Studio Davout\, Studio Louxor\, Paris\, France and Systems Two\, New York\, New York between May & June 2002.  Personnel: Nguyên Lê (guitar\, guitar synthesizer); Terri Lyne Carrington (vocals\, drums); Michel Alibo (electric bass).

COL title VAL One Dance COL performer VAL Travis Atreo	COL video title VAL PETER PAUL AND MARY CD Vintage Folk. If I Had A hammer \, 500 Miles \, Lemon Tree COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Peter\, Paul and Mary (también llamado PP&M) fue uno de los grupos musicales estadounidenses de música folk más exitosos de la década de 1960. Estaba compuesto por Peter Yarrow\, Paul Stookey y Mary Travers.  En 1962 iniciaron su carrera musical con su primer disco llamado Peter\,Paul & Mary. En las décadas anteriores de los 60s la música folk fue identificada por artistas como Woody Guthrie o Pete Seeger.Cuando Peter\, Paul y Mary llegaron a la escena\, para la mayoría de América\, folk era visto sólo como una barra lateral a la música pop que empleó instrumentos acústicos.  En esta coyuntura histórica crítica\, con el país todavía se está recuperando de la era de McCarthy\, el Movimiento de los Derechos Civiles a tomar forma\, la guerra fría y calentar un espíritu naciente de activismo en el aire; Peter Yarrow\, Noel Stookey (Paul) y Mary Travers vino junto a yuxtaponer estas corrientes cruzadas y así recuperar la potencia popular como fuerza social\, cultural y político. Pero pocos a la vez podría haber dado cuenta de lo penetrante fervor y el mensaje del grupo de la humanidad\, la esperanza y activismo se abrazaron.  Tener su música asociada con causas y soluciones es tan natural como respirar para Peter\, Paul y Mary. La música y la acción que genera son igualmente importantes para ellos y están en el corazón de su historia. Más recientemente\, sus esfuerzos individuales y colectivos se han centrado en temas tan cruciales como la violencia armada contra los niños\, los derechos de las y los esfuerzos de organización de los recolectores de fresas en California\, la indigencia y el hambre mundial.  Ningún grupo folk americano ha durado más o acumulado muchos seguidores más leales que Peter\, Paul and Mary\, de hecho\, algunos grupos de cualquier género han registrado más años (45) o millas (incontables) gira en directo\, anualmente\, la difusión del mensaje y la participación los siguientes (ahora cuatro) generaciones. Durante su carrera legendaria\, el trío ganó cinco premios Grammy\, produjo 13 Top 40 hits\, 6 de las cuales subió a los Top 10 - así como ocho de oro y cinco discos de platino. Eso PP & M alcanzado tal nivel enrarecido de éxito comercial sin compromiso y sin dejar una tradición centenaria de las personas que levantan sus voces en una canción por el bien de la libertad\, es simplemente una prueba más de su extraordinariamente exitosa carrera tanto una misión cumplida como una carrera musical.

COL title VAL Unforgiven COL performer VAL Iron Horse [1]	COL video title VAL Nancy Sinatra & Lee Hazlewood: Some Velvet Morning COL channel name VAL calicomoonchild COL description VAL The second song I ever really loved.   I have loved & lived with this song all my life and it is one of my favourite top 10 tracks of all time.   Track Meaning:  One day when the male character in the song is sober and has his head "straight"\, he will impart something of significance to his current love about his earliest & deepest love\, a woman named "pheadra" whose memory he is still haunted by.  Hence the repetition of the Pheadra/ Nancy portion of the song . . .  her section symbolising the "haunting" and struggle inside his head as he tries to gain "closure" from this past relationship with a mysterious former love Pheadra . . . his part of the song being directed to his new lover in the present.    His present lack of sobriety (drunkeness) describing his vain attempts to drown out the all consuming memory of this mysterious former love\, a memory that he is aware is annoying his present lover and describes his fear that she may leave him as a result of his "haunting" by his old (first)love.  Note:  At the point in history this song was written the labels of "straight" (meaning hetrosexual) and "gay" (meaning homosexual) did not yet exist.  In fact by the late sixties the term "gay" was just another word for "happy".	0

COL title VAL Love Supreme COL performer VAL Harry Manx	COL video title VAL TIME OUT FOR TEARS -Bill Lawrence COL channel name VAL montanarecordhunter COL description VAL Columbia 39029   I ended up with about 100 vintage old LP's and while they have little if any monetary or collector value given condition and storage issues yet I couldn't bear to get rid of them.  I am going through the whole collection and putting all of them online.  I started this channel because posting all of this music on my main mining and carpentry channel was driving subscribers away.  Some of the stuff is kind of rare and a bunch of it will be the only copy on youtube.  In theory all of these records are for sale if you want them.  Message me in the comments.   All of the records are being played on Zenith 6R-668 tube type radio and record player.  When I picked it up from the leftovers pile at the estate it was not working.  While not a record player expert by any means\, I was able to get it operable.  The needle is rough but after carefully reshaping it on a diamond stone I got it to play much better.  So far no replacement needle can be located.  I found one that fit the holder but it was the newer style and didn't work with 78's.  You can get a look at the player by following this link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YCtwrOdGb8 We have no intention of fighting any content challenges; even the bogus ones and so will simply acknowledge and move on.  My only goal is to put it out there before it is gone.  In theory any of these records is for sale and you need but drop me a line in the comments.  I do intend to monetize but understand we are talking a predicted whole channel income of less than $5 a month.  Anything helps and this take a lot of times so please don't hate me for that. --Ken	0

COL title VAL Crazy for You COL performer VAL Me First and The Gimme Gimmes	COL video title VAL ♥ "She Loves Me" - by Jack Jones COL channel name VAL 65Seasons COL description VAL Song: She Loves Me Singer: Jack Jones  "She Loves Me" is a musical with a book by Joe Masteroff\, lyrics by Sheldon Harnick\, and music by Jerry Bock.  The musical is the fifth adaptation of the play Parfumerie by Hungarian playwright Miklos Laszlo\, following the 1940 James Stewart-Margaret Sullavan film The Shop around the Corner and the 1949 Judy Garland-Van Johnson musical version In the Good Old Summertime.   The 1978 BBC version starring Robin Ellis and Gemma Craven is worth watching too.  It would surface yet again in 1998 as the Tom Hanks-Meg Ryan feature You've Got Mail. The plot revolves around Budapest shop employees Georg Nowack and Amalia Balash who\, despite being consistently at odds with each other at work\, are unaware that each is the other's secret pen pal met through lonely-hearts ads. The musical premiered on Broadway in 1963\, and subsequently had productions in the West End in 1964 and award-winning revivals on each side of the Atlantic in the 1990s\, as well as regional productions. ***	0

Blige	COL video title VAL ELIO PACE - I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues (from the album 'Come And Get It' 2002) 8of 16 COL channel name VAL rosarecordsonline COL description VAL 'I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues' was written by Elton John\, Bernie Taupin and Davey Johnstone and was originally recorded by Elton John.  _________________________  A message from Elio...  The original concept behind 'Come And Get It'\, was to produce a high quality demo for me and my band to use as promotion with a view to attracting bigger and better corporate work as a 'covers band'. It was never intended for commercial release. Proving this point\, the original two-thousand CDs pressed in February 2002\, had no barcode on the artwork.  In fact\, the idea (going into the first day of recording) was to record only segments of 10 or 12 songs and to create a five-minute showreel. It was only just as recording was about to commence that Darren Loveday (one of two guitarists in the band at the time and my co-producer on the project) suggested that for the time it took to decide which segment of each song should be recorded\, we may as well play the whole song from start to finish\, especially as we all knew the songs so well\, having played them so many times. It was only when listening back the following day to the 13-tracks we'd recorded\, that Darren and I decided to create a full album of the material.  It was also decided that along with the 13 'new' songs\, we should make use of the 74-minutes available on CD (at the time) and include; a previous demo we'd made in 1998 of Billy Joel's 'My Life'; a live stereo recording (off MiniDisc\, with a few overdubs) of Jerry Lee Lewis' 'Great Balls Of Fire' from August 2000; and demos of three original songs I'd written (Addicted To The Phone\, Got The Bug Back and Katy Likes House) which would eventually be re-recorded and released on my 2009 'debut' album\, 'A Seat At My Table.  The last item that we decided to include on this original 19-track album was a 1998 demo we had recorded of Delbert McClinton's 'Two More Bottles Of Wine'. Ironically\, it was THIS little track (with just myself on piano\, Darren on guitar and the both of us doing the backing vocals and hand-claps) that realised the original concept for this album and opened a huge door for me in my career. Sir Terry Wogan and the late Paul Walters\, working together on BBC Radio 2's 'Wake Up To Wogan'\, played my version of 'Two More Bottles Of Wine' on their show\, once a week for six-months\, from August 2003. It was the first time that one of my recordings had been played on national radio in the UK. I really wasn't prepared for it as I didn't even have a website at the time.  I eventually got my act together and although casually stocked in a hand-full of small record shops\, 'Come And Get It' (on my own label\, Rosa Records) became available to buy in 2005 on CD via my website and then released to the general public as a download in 2007. This digital release and the subsequent CD pressings does not include the three demos of my songs... for obvious reasons. Now discontinued\, you would have to hunt down one of the original batch of those two-thousand CDs pressed in February 2002.  By the way\, the billing as 'The Elio Pace Band' was purely to guarantee that prospective clients knew that they were not booking just an individual at a piano and to differentiate between my two 'hats' as a performer; a) playing 'dance party' covers and b) playing my own material\, for which I would simply be known as Elio Pace. Interestingly\, Terry Wogan never once announced my record as 'The Elio Pace Band'. Instead he always referred to me as "Elio Pace and his band". 'Come And Get It' was the first and only album that will have 'The Elio Pace Band' as the artist name although I fully expect to record another album of covers sometime in the future.  _________________________  Track listing:  1.

Rob Ivey (Batching It)  http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#!/pages/Batching-It/141041665946741 http://www.myspace.com/batchingit09 http://www.twitter.com/batching_it  From Batching It's debut album "Homage".  The Unforgiven as originally performed by Metallica.  Batching It is a one-man punk-rock cover band featuring Rob Ivey\, a San Francisco East Bay musician. Hailing from Vallejo\, CA\, Rob was previously in Vallejo bands Bottomdawg and The V-Town Have-Nots \, and also played drums in Diabolical Exploits with veteran punk-rock producer Andy Ernst\, who has produced such notable bands as Green Day\, Rancid\, and AFI.  The name 'Batching It' is short for 'batcheloring it'\, or 'going it alone'\, which perfectly describes the philosophy behind the project. After many years of not being in a band\, Rob's nostalgia kicked in and he decided that it was time to make a cover album of influential bands/songs\, songs and bands that inspired him to become a musician in his teenage years. The first Batching It project\, due out in the Fall of 2009 on Leficit Records\, is called 'Homage' - a self-explanatory title. Rob wanted to pay tribute to these bands and songs by reintroducing them to the new generation\, and covered in Rob's personal favorite styles.  Recorded at the legendary Art of Ears studio in Hayward\, CA by Andy Ernst\, and produced by Mike Lawson of Leficit Records\, 'Homage' is a 15-track nod to\, in Rob's opinion\, 15 awesome bands: NOFX\, Skankin' Pickle\, Swingin' Utters\, Pearl Jam\, Rancid\, Lagwagon\, Metallica\, Sublime\, No Use For a Name\, Smashing Pumpkins\, Weezer\, No Doubt\, The Descendents\, Less Than Jake\, and Operation Ivy. Crossing rock genres\, just like Rob's personal tastes\, 'Homage' should have something for everyone.	0

COL title VAL If I Had My Way COL performer VAL Karl Denver	COL video title VAL PETER PAUL AND MARY CD Vintage Folk. If I Had A hammer \, 500 Miles \, Lemon Tree COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Peter\, Paul and Mary (también llamado PP&M) fue uno de los grupos musicales estadounidenses de música folk más exitosos de la década de 1960. Estaba compuesto por Peter Yarrow\, Paul Stookey y Mary Travers.  En 1962 iniciaron su carrera musical con su primer disco llamado Peter\,Paul & Mary. En las décadas anteriores de los 60s la música folk fue identificada por artistas como Woody Guthrie o Pete Seeger.Cuando Peter\, Paul y Mary llegaron a la escena\, para la mayoría de América\, folk era visto sólo como una barra lateral a la música pop que empleó instrumentos acústicos.  En esta coyuntura histórica crítica\, con el país todavía se está recuperando de la era de McCarthy\, el Movimiento de los Derechos Civiles a tomar forma\, la guerra fría y calentar un espíritu naciente de activismo en el aire; Peter Yarrow\, Noel Stookey (Paul) y Mary Travers vino junto a yuxtaponer estas corrientes cruzadas y así recuperar la potencia popular como fuerza social\, cultural y político. Pero pocos a la vez podría haber dado cuenta de lo penetrante fervor y el mensaje del grupo de la humanidad\, la esperanza y activismo se abrazaron.  Tener su música asociada con causas y soluciones es tan natural como respirar para Peter\, Paul y Mary. La música y la acción que genera son igualmente importantes para ellos y están en el corazón de su historia. Más recientemente\, sus esfuerzos individuales y colectivos se han centrado en temas tan cruciales como la violencia armada contra los niños\, los derechos de las y los esfuerzos de organización de los recolectores de fresas en California\, la indigencia y el hambre mundial.  Ningún grupo folk americano ha durado más o acumulado muchos seguidores más leales que Peter\, Paul and Mary\, de hecho\, algunos grupos de cualquier género han registrado más años (45) o millas (incontables) gira en directo\, anualmente\, la difusión del mensaje y la participación los siguientes (ahora cuatro) generaciones. Durante su carrera legendaria\, el trío ganó cinco premios Grammy\, produjo 13 Top 40 hits\, 6 de las cuales subió a los Top 10 - así como ocho de oro y cinco discos de platino. Eso PP & M alcanzado tal nivel enrarecido de éxito comercial sin compromiso y sin dejar una tradición centenaria de las personas que levantan sus voces en una canción por el bien de la libertad\, es simplemente una prueba más de su extraordinariamente exitosa carrera tanto una misión cumplida como una carrera musical.

COL title VAL That Will Never Do COL performer VAL Freddie King	COL video title VAL Joan of Arc (Leonard Cohen) - Allison Crowe w. lyrics COL channel name VAL Allison Crowe COL description VAL On her debut album "secrets" Allison Crowe covers this Leonard Cohen song. Her voice and piano is accompanied by Jo Lundstrom (Rosehip Jam\, Black Velvet Band) on accordion. Crowe engineered the recording\, with production by Rainer Willeke (of Victoria\, B.C.'s Raindog Studios).  http://music.allisoncrowe.com/track/joan-of-arc  The photo of Allison Crowe is by Billie Woods.  MOJO magazine's December '08 issue paid tribute to "Rock's Greatest Poet" Leonard Cohen with a celebration of his "deep and moving music". Of Allison Crowe's contribution of "Joan of Arc" to its 'All Star Tribute"\, (featuring Judy Collins\, Nick Cave\, Katie Melua\, Martha Wainwright\, Dion and others)\, a cover-mount CD titled "Cohen Covered"\, MOJO says: "Once famously described by the Vancouver Courier as possessing a style akin to 'Elton John meets Edith Piaf'\, the Canadian singer-songwriter Allison Crowe is renowned for her ability to blend control and melodrama. Certainly she does so on this spirited cover of Cohen's 'Songs of Love and Hate' classic\, a track which also powerfully showcases her considerable talent as a fine interpreter of song."  "Any album that features a track from Leonard Cohen is certainly heading in the right direction. But when it is covered so beautifully\, it makes you realise what an amazing lyricist Leonard Cohen is. Joan of Arc is the Cohen song covered on this album and it's certainly in my top 10 of Cohen covers. It's also my favorite track on (Secrets)" ~ Colin Meeks\, indielaunchpad.com (USA)  Joan of Arc  Words & Music by Leonard Cohen As performed by Allison Crowe  Now the flames they followed Joan of Arc as she came riding through the dark; no moon to keep her armour bright\, no man to get her through this dark and smoky night.   She said\, "I'm tired of the war\, I want the kind of work I had before\, A wedding dress or something white to wear upon my swollen appetite."  Well\, I'm glad to hear you talk this way\, I've watched you riding every day and there is something in me that yearns to win such a cold\, such a lonesome heroine.  "And who are you?" she sternly spoke to the one beneath the smoke. "Why\, I'm fire\," he replied\, "And I love your solitude\, I love your pride."  "Well\, then\, fire make your body cold\, I'm going to give you mine to hold." And saying this she climbed inside to be his one\, to be his only bride.  Then deep into his fiery heart he took the dust of Joan of Arc\, and high above all these wedding guests he hung the ashes of her lovely wedding dress.  It was deep into his fiery heart he took the dust of Joan of Arc\, and then she clearly understood if he was fire\, oh\, she must be wood.  I saw her wince\, I saw her cry\, I saw the glory in her eye. Myself I long for love and light\, but must it come so cruel\,  must it be so bright?	0

COL title VAL Scorpio Rising COL performer VAL Death in Vegas	COL video title VAL Hall & Oates - Everyday Will Be Like A Holiday COL channel name VAL thatMimosaGrove COL description VAL 4th track from "Home For Christmas" (2006). The grammarian in me wants to change the spelling from "Everyday" to "Every Day." But who cares\, right? All that really matters is that the biggest-selling duo in Yacht Rock history has made a Christmas album!  On this track\, Hall and Oates cover William Bell and Booker T. Jones' classic R&B tune\, retaining not only the original spelling of the title but the warm vibe as well. But while the original song doesn't actually mention Christmas by name\, in typical Daryl Hall fashion\, the lyrics have been altered slightly and now leave no doubt about the holiday in question. In addition\, the duo gives this song—like all the others on the album—a smooth\, slick veneer that's nevertheless earthy\, friendly\, and comforting.   "Every day will be like a holiday / When my baby\, when my baby comes home Here she comes / I think I see her right now..."  They've really got my believing it!   ~thatMimosaGrove  P.S. – I plan to upload\, if not all\, at least a few more songs from this excellent album (which\, btw\, is weighted on the side of the sacred and reverential—a definite plus in my book). I started with this particular song because I couldn't find the album version on YouTube.

Squee~  I love this song so so so so so so so so much. And very few people seem to know about it\, so I thought I'd make this.

This is proven true\, given the fact that I recently discovered her albums—and I just haven't had my fill. I've searched and purchased everything I could find from such a gifted songstress. Lorez crafts each lyric with such grace and tonality that could easily match (if not surpass) the reigning jazz stylists of the bop/jazz/pop age. She gives each standard a new sense of evocative meaning as far as lyrics are concerned\, and reinvents the wheel each time she unleashes her enthralling voice. As she once said "A lyric is dead\, until you breathe life into it." This is exactly what she does. Enjoy and listen in HD\, to the lovely—Lorez Alexandria.	0

COL title VAL Coconut COL performer VAL Sprung Monkey	COL video title VAL Henry Mancini -   Tiny Bubbles COL channel name VAL Socratess2007 COL description VAL "I think there is a song out there to describe just about any situation."― Criss Jami ▼▼▼  HENRY MANCINI Enrico Nicola "Henry" Mancini was an American composer\, arranger and conductor\, who is best remembered for his film and television scores.  He won a record number of Grammy Awards\, plus a posthumous Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995. His best-known works include the jazz-idiom theme to The Pink Panther film series ("The Pink Panther Theme") and the theme to the Peter Gunn television series.  Mancini had a long collaboration with the film director Blake Edwards and won numerous Academy Awards for the songs in Edwards films\, including "Moon River" from Breakfast at Tiffany's\, "Days of Wine and Roses" and for the score to "Victor Victoria". Entering 1946\, Mancini became a pianist and arranger for the newly re-formed Glenn Miller Orchestra\, led by 'Everyman' Tex Beneke. After World War II\, Mancini broadened his skills in composition\, counterpoint\, harmony and orchestration during studies opening with the composers Ernst Krenek and Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco.  In 1952\, Mancini joined the Universal Pictures music department. During the next six years\, he contributed music to over 100 movies\, most notably The Creature from the Black Lagoon\, It Came from Outer Space\, Tarantula\, This Island Earth\, The Glenn Miller Story (for which he received his first Academy Award nomination)\, The Benny Goodman Story and Orson Welles' Touch of Evil. During this time\, he also wrote some popular songs. His first hit was a single by Guy Lombardo and His Royal Canadians titled I Won't Let You Out of My Heart. Mancini left Universal to work as an independent composer/arranger in 1958. Soon after\, he scored the television series Peter Gunn for writer/producer Blake Edwards. This was the genesis of a relationship in which Edwards and Mancini collaborated on 30 films over 35 years.  Along with Alex North\, Elmer Bernstein\, Leith Stevens and Johnny Mandel\, Henry Mancini was a pioneer of the inclusion of jazz elements in the late romantic orchestral film and TV scoring prevalent at the time. Mancini scored many TV movies\, including The Thorn Birds and The Shadow Box. He wrote many television themes\, including Mr. Lucky (starring John Vivyan and Ross Martin)\, NBC Mystery Movie\, What's Happening\, Tic Tac Dough (1990 version) and Once Is Not Enough. In the 1984--85 television season\, four series featured original Mancini themes: Newhart\, Hotel\, Remington Steele\, and Ripley's Believe It or Not. Mancini also composed the "Viewer Mail" theme for Late Night with David Letterman. Mancini composed the theme for NBC Nightly News used beginning in 1975\, and a different theme by him\, titled Salute to the President was used by NBC News for its election coverage (including primaries and conventions) from 1976 to 1992. Salute to the President was only published in a school-band arrangement\, although Mancini performed it frequently with symphony orchestras on his concert tours. Songs with music by Mancini were staples of the easy listening genre from the 1960s to the 1980s. Some of the artists who have recorded Mancini songs include Andy Williams\, Paul Anka\, Pat Boone\, Anita Bryant\, Jack Jones\, Frank Sinatra\, Perry Como\, Connie Francis\, Eydie Gorme\, Steve Lawrence\, Trini Lopez\, George Maharis\, Johnny Mathis\, Jerry Vale and Ray Conniff\, to name just a few.... Mancini recorded over 90 albums\, in styles ranging from big band to light classical to pop. Eight of these albums were certified gold by The Recording Industry Association of America. He had a 20-year contract with RCA Records\, resulting in 60 commercial record albums that made him a household name among artists of easy-listening music.  TINY BUBBLES "Tiny Bubbles" is a song written by Martin Denny and Leon Pober. It was released in 1966 by Don Ho.  It is widely considered to be Denny's most famous song.  MHO "Tiny Bubbles" is -\, with all due respect for Mr Denny\, a rather "simple" song but... hand the notes to a top arranger like Henry Mancini and .... what you get is a fabulous orchestral arrangement that\, in a way\, transforms the song into an easy floating ballad.  A particularly rich instrumentation with strings\, brass\, and all the other "standard" instruments of a large orchestra\, completed with the sound of the ukelele and harp\, so typical for the Hawaiian style music.  The Mancini chorus adds some warmth and "body" to the recording\, so\, in the end\, we get to hear a splendid version of this well known theme.   Have a great (musical) trip to "Aloha country" :) !  Enjoy.	0
COL title VAL Seven Nights to Rock COL performer VAL Rockin' the Joint	COL video title VAL Alf Cranner - Sjømannsvise - 1966 COL channel name VAL Cauldron20 COL description VAL Sjømannsvise av Harald Sverdrup ble tonesatt av visekunstneren Alf Cranner.   Visa ble presentert under turneen «Vers og viiiiiiser. Lyriske utskeielser ved Harald Sverdrup og Alf Cranner» i 1966\, og utgitt på LP året samme høst.   Sjømannsvise har blitt en av Cranners mest folkekjære viser\, og den har kommet på flere plateinnspillinger siden.   Den svenske trubaduren Cornelis Vreeswijk lagde en egen tekstversjon av Sjømannsvise som han kalt Ågren.   Han oppgav opprinnelig melodien som «norsk folketone»\, men førte opp Cranner som komponist da han gav ut visa på plata Poem\, ballader och lite blues i 1970.  En sjømannsvise er en vise om sjømenn og livet ombord\, eller en vise som er populær blant sjømenn.   Sjømannsviser kan deles i to grupper. Sjantier som var arbeidssangen ombord på seilskutene og frivaktsviser som var populære sanger blant sjømenn.	0

Versjon fra albumet "Velvalgte viser".  Dette er en sang som jeg liker veldig godt og som betyr veldig mye for meg. ___________________________________  Ja fysst så vil je nevne min stilling og min stæinn\, je står og svarver hatter i Salomo sitt læinn. Sjøl bær je navnet Jørgen\, så skilnaden er stor\, men både je og Salomo kom nakne tel vår jord.  Refr.:  Sola skin på deg så skuggen fell på meg men graset er grønt for æille.  Når liljene på marken i fager blomstring står\, og alle himlens fugler sin glade trille slår\, je nynne såmmå strofa i hattemakergrenn\, og morgendagen\, Salomo\, hva vet vel vi om den?  Refr.  Har Salomo sitt måltid med vin og fylte fat\, je sug på harde skorper og kæille det for mat\, men det vi gir ifrå øss di vi i lønndom går blir gras til hyrdens hvite lam og Sarons sorte får.  Refr.  Når dronningen av Saba gjør Salomo visitt\, je ser a "Lea Lettvint" og hu har tenkt seg hit. Om leiet blir forskjellig frå silkeseng tel strå\, vi går mot såmmå paradis og hører harper slå.  Refr.  Når sola synk og dale bak slottets tårn og tind\, så kjæm den mørke natta med drøm og tankespinn\, der blir je sjøl Kong Salomo og hæin blir kænskje den som står og svarver hatter uti hattemakergrenn.

Squee~  I love this song so so so so so so so so much. And very few people seem to know about it\, so I thought I'd make this.  If the lyrics sound familiar\, it's because this is actually a partial cover (?) to Head Like A Hole by Nine Inch Nails. The melody is different.  I modified the lyrics for this video from http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/2508/ and the beautiful picture is from http://snakeplaya24.deviantart.com/art/space-67540954. The font used is Little Sparrow. Hope you enjoy this! ♥  P.S. Forgot to mention\, this video is heavily inspired by Platypiz/ Platypizz/ Platypiz1/ Platypiz2/ any other incarnations this person may have. If you don't know this channel\, it's a channel with lovely lyric videos to Korean songs. So go check it out if you like Korean songs! That's all for now! ♥	0

COL title VAL Cruel to Be Kind COL performer VAL Letters to Cleo	COL video title VAL cruel to be kind\, cover\, pitwork\, 1999\, clover records COL channel name VAL pitworkwork COL description VAL review by Mike DaRonco  Pitwork can be easily compared to a warm summer day on a playground: innocent\, bouncy\, and full of energy. Cheesy metaphors aside\, this Japanese duo minimally incorporates playful pop and an eclectic use of instruments: from the basic structure of drums\, bass\, and guitar to drum machines and harmonica to even a canned audience. Happy-go-lucky all the way through\, this self-titled EP manages to cover some new ground in indie pop without being overly sentimental or experimental. Fans of Tiger Trap\, the Softies and Stereolab should take notice.	1

COL title VAL The End COL performer VAL Days of the New	COL video title VAL VOGUES   IT'S GETTING BETTER 1968 Reprise Records    RS 6314 COL channel name VAL Amnondoowop COL description VAL It's Getting Better is a song written by Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil that was a sunshine pop hit single in 1969 for Cass Elliot.  The song describes the singer's satisfaction with a love relationship that is down-to-earth rather than extravagantly romantic\, a subgenre of love song exemplified by the Jerome Kern/ P. G. Wodehouse composition "Bill". Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil had previously written the similarly themed "He's Sure the Boy I Love"\, a hit for the Crystals in 1963.  "It's Getting Better" was first recorded by the Vogues for inclusion on their Reprise album\, TURN AROUND\, LOOK AT ME\, which was released by August\, 1968. The next version was one by Leonard Nimoy for his Dot Records lp\, THE WAY I FEEL. That was by October\, 1968. It was by March\, 1969 when The Will-O-Bees\, a New York City based trio (Janet Blossom\, Steven Porter\, and Robert Merchanthouse) who recorded a number of Mann-Weil compositions\, also had a single release of "It's Getting Better" on the SGC label (Screen Gems Columbia). The Mama Cass version happened by May\, 1969\, initially as a single advance release and then an album cut\, the single release referencing the album.  1969 saw the release of several single versions of "It's Getting Better" but only Cass Elliot's was by an established artist\, the other versions being by Ronnie Buskirk\, Freddie Gelfand\, and P. K. Limited. [1]  "It's Getting Better" had been recorded by Cass Elliot for inclusion on her June 1969 album release Bubble Gum\, Lemonade\, and... Something for Mama\, which was produced by Steve Barri and arranged by Jimmie Haskell. The Wrecking Crew (James Burton on guitar\, Hal Blaine on drums\, Larry Knechtel on keyboards\, and Joe Osborn on bass) — who'd regularly backed the Mamas & the Papas — were among the instrumentalists on the album.  "It's Getting Better" was issued as the second advance single in May 1969 following the release that March of "Move in a Little Closer\, Baby"\, a single reminiscent of the Mamas & the Papas sound which reached a Billboard Hot 100 peak of #58. Steve Barri says that "Move in a Little Closer\, Baby" was "one [album track] [Elliot] wasn't too thrilled about...but she loved 'It's Getting Better'".[2]  A #13 Easy Listening hit\, "It's Getting Better" reached #30 on the Hot 100.[3] It remained on the U.S. charts for 18 weeks.[4] The single's regional success was staggered\, and it reached the Top Ten in several markets\, ranking as high as #2 in Minneapolis-Saint Paul and San Diego.[5] Its estimated U.S. sales were 500\,000 copies.[4]  "It's Getting Better" had a more pronounced chart impact in the UK\, reaching #8 in October 1969 and selling almost 100\,000 copies\, despite a potential rival version by Paul Jones. The single bested the UK chart performance of Elliot's signature song\, "Dream a Little Dream of Me" (#11)\, which had lost some popularity to a rival version by Anita Harris. [6] [4]  "Dream a Little Dream of Me" and "It's Getting Better" would be Elliot's only two UK chart appearances. In the U.S.\, "It's Getting Better" was the fourth of Elliot's seven solo Billboard Hot 100 appearances and her second Top 40 hit after "Dream a Little Dream of Me".  In Australia "It's Getting Better" by Cass Elliott charted at #53.  In the wake of the success of "It's Getting Better"\, Elliot's next two singles were recordings of Barry Mann-Cynthia Weil compositions: "Make Your Own Kind of Music" — which like "It's Getting Better" had been recorded by the Will-O-Bees in 1968 — and a new song\, "New World Coming". Although both songs are now considered soft rock classics\, their original chart success was fairly mild: "Make Your Own Kind of Music" peaked at #36 (Elliot's third and final solo Top 40 appearance)\, and "New World Coming" peaked at #42.[7]  "It's Getting Better" has also been recorded by Richard Barnes\, New Cactus Band\, Louise Morrissey\, the Popinjays\, Kevin Rowland and John & Anne Ryder. Bobby Rydell made it in 1976 for Born With a Smile\, his sole album released after 1964.[1][7] Jane McDonald's rendition of "It's Getting Better" can be heard on her 2010 concert album Live at the London Palladium. A Swedish rendering of "It's Getting Better" by lyricist Stig Anderson entitled "Det Känns Bara Bättre" was cut by Anna-Lena Löfgren in 1970.  In 2011 Cass Elliot's "It's Getting Better" was employed in a television advertisement for Nestea.	0

Purchase from the label: http://www.paradiseofbachelors.com/shop/pob-21 Purchase from Bandcamp: https://paradiseofbachelors.bandcamp.com/album/ambsace Other options: http://lnk.to/PoB21  The second album of astonishing duets by guitarists James Elkington (who has toured and/or recorded with Jeff Tweedy\, Richard Thompson\, and Steve Gunn\, among others) and Nathan Salsburg (an accomplished soloist deemed by NPR “one of those names we’ll all associate with American folk guitar”) is a sublime suite of nimble\, filigreed compositions by two singular stylists.

COL title VAL My Heart Would Know COL performer VAL Hank Williams\, Jr. & Lois Johnson	COL video title VAL TIME OUT FOR TEARS -Bill Lawrence COL channel name VAL montanarecordhunter COL description VAL Columbia 39029   I ended up with about 100 vintage old LP's and while they have little if any monetary or collector value given condition and storage issues yet I couldn't bear to get rid of them.  I am going through the whole collection and putting all of them online.  I started this channel because posting all of this music on my main mining and carpentry channel was driving subscribers away.  Some of the stuff is kind of rare and a bunch of it will be the only copy on youtube.  In theory all of these records are for sale if you want them.  Message me in the comments.   All of the records are being played on Zenith 6R-668 tube type radio and record player.  When I picked it up from the leftovers pile at the estate it was not working.  While not a record player expert by any means\, I was able to get it operable.  The needle is rough but after carefully reshaping it on a diamond stone I got it to play much better.  So far no replacement needle can be located.  I found one that fit the holder but it was the newer style and didn't work with 78's.  You can get a look at the player by following this link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YCtwrOdGb8 We have no intention of fighting any content challenges; even the bogus ones and so will simply acknowledge and move on.  My only goal is to put it out there before it is gone.  In theory any of these records is for sale and you need but drop me a line in the comments.  I do intend to monetize but understand we are talking a predicted whole channel income of less than $5 a month.  Anything helps and this take a lot of times so please don't hate me for that. --Ken	0

Some day you'll return to  Your valleys and your farms  And you'll no longer burn  To be brothers in arms.    Through these fields of destruction  Baptism of fire  I've witnessed your suffering  As the battle raged higher.  And though they did hurt me so bad  In my fear and alarm  You did not desert me  My brothers in arms.    There's so many different worlds  So many different suns  And we have just one world  But we live in different ones.    Now the sun's gone to hell  And the moon's riding high  Let me bid you farewell  Every man has to die.  But it's written in the starlight  And every line in your palm  We're fools to make war  On our brothers in arms...	0

His first recordings were in the Cool Jazz style and after his collaboration with Martin Denny he finally created his very own style \, excelling in moody  Vibraphone /Marimba dominated modern Hawaiian Jazz.. Adventures was originally composed by Lionel Newman \, a member of a great  composers dynasty . It was created as TV theme for the popular TV series \, wich is introduced in this video at the first 17 seconds .The first series ran from 1958 till 1961. Lyman recorded "Adventures " in 1961  on the Ryckodisc label.It was part of the  famous Yellow Bird album. Starring in this video are also some guest stars from the TV series back then. The eclectic sound of Lyman's music justifys a good audiosystem \, or the use of headphones.These records were produced by the sound engineer Richard Vaughn in the beginning day's of stereo recording \, and were quite inventive in those day's.

Between 1921 and 1935 many musicians joined and left the California Ramblers including the famous Dorsey Brothers and the very eccentric\, Jack Purvis (trombone and trumpet)\, who is said to have trashed and burned hotel rooms\, flown as a soldier of fortune\, played 52nd St.\, scored music for full orchestra\, and eventually led a prison band. Other members included Adrian Rollini (bass sax and xylophone)\, Fud Livingston and Bobby Davis (saxophones)\, and Chelsea Quealey.     During the 1920s the band was so in demand that they purchased a hotel on Pelham Parkway in the Bronx where they lived\, practiced\, and performed\, and dubbed it the Ramblers Inn. They went on to play some of the greatest clubs in New York City including the Rainbow Room at the top of the Rockefeller Center.     The original recordings made here were all “acoustical” 78s and interestingly\, recorded prior to the introduction of the microphone in 1925.     Although the music has been all but lost in our modern society\, it is my hope that these remastered jewels plucked from of our early American traditions will now live on into the 21st century and beyond.

COL title VAL Walk Between the Raindrops COL performer VAL John Pizzarelli	COL video title VAL Hoagy Carmichael - Little Old Lady COL channel name VAL 2ndviolinist COL description VAL From www.hoagy.com  Hoagland Howard Carmichael was born in 1899 in Bloomington. His father was an itinerant laborer who moved his family throughout the Midwest looking for steady work\, always returning to Indiana. "Home" was back in Bloomington\, where they'd left his wife Lida's golden oak piano. She helped support the family by playing at the local movie house and for university dances. "Ragtime was my lullaby\," Hoagy said\, and though his mother was thrilled when he picked out a tune on the golden oak\, she warned him: "Music is fun\, Hoagland\, but it don't buy you cornpone."  Lida Carmichael thought her son might grow up to be president of a railroad. He might have\, too\, because ambition burned hot in him\, but in 1919 he heard Louie Jordan's band (not to be confused with Louis Jordan who had a popular band in the thirties) in Indianapolis and this black ensemble of early jazz players "exploded in me almost more music than I could consume." Hoagy went on to study law at Indiana University but he was already a "jazz maniac" and his own band\, The Carmichael Syringe Orchestra\, was made up of a gang of loose cannons whose spiritual leader was a Dada-inspired poet named Monk. "There are other things in this world besides hot music\," Monk advised Hoagy in a serious moment\, "I forget what they are--but they're around." Those 'other things' were named Dorothy Kelly\, and to Hoagy she was more than first love. Dorothy was a secure respectable life in one of those big houses up on the hill in Bloomington he'd dreamt of as a boy\, and when he held her in his arms\, that was what he wanted more than anything else.  Then Hoagy heard a young white cornetist named Bix Beiderbecke and\, "it threw my judgment out of kilter." This was a sound like nothing he'd heard before and when Hoagy played an improvised tune for Bix\, the strange young man with a magical horn said\, "Whyn't you write music\, Hoagy?" The rest of his life was the answer to Bix's question.  Many years later\, when an audience saw the mature Hoagy sitting at the piano singing "Lazybones" or "Ole Buttermilk Sky" in what he called his 'native wood-note and flatsy- through-the-nose voice\,' it looked so natural and relaxed that it was easy to assume he'd led a charmed life. But Hoagy's road to success was just as bumpy and lurching as his friend Bix's was smooth and quick.After a modest but deceptive early success with "Washboard Blues" and "Riverboat Shuffle\," Hoagy packed a bag and went to New York. But he soon found himself scuffling around the cold\, lonely town\, not selling anything but bonds in a bottom-end job at a Wall St. brokerage house. "I'm singing the music publisher's theme song-it ain't a commercial\," he wrote back to Monk. He tried to give up--more than once--but the words of another old friend kept him going. Reggie Duval\, a black barber and dance hall pianist in Indianapolis\, was the only teacher Hoagy ever had besides his mother. Reggie had taught Hoagy how to make music 'jump' and also gave him a creed to live by: "Never play anything that don't sound right. You might not make any money--but at least you won't get hostile with yourself."  Hoagy kept writing what sounded 'right' and in 1930 made recordings of "Georgia On My Mind\," "Rockin' Chair\," and "Lazy River." Other artists heard the new songs and within a year Louis Armstrong\, Duke Ellington and the Dorsey brothers had recorded their own versions and were performing them on the new hot medium\, radio. Hoagy Carmichael himself was still barely known to the public\, but they were hearing and singing his songs\, and in 1936 Hoagy went to Hollywood where "the rainbow hits the ground for composers."  During the next decade\, Hoagy moved from backstage into the spotlight. He worked with lyricists Johnny Mercer\, Frank Loesser and Mitchell Parish. He became a star performer on records\, radio and stage with a signature style\, and began appearing in movies\, most memorably in "To Have and Have Not" and "The Best Years of Our Lives". He got married and fathered two sons. In one year\, 1946\, he had three of the top four songs on the Hit Parade\, and in 1951 he and Mercer won an Oscar for "In the Cool\, Cool\, Cool of the Evening." He hosted his own television show\, "The Saturday Night Review."  'Hoagy' was no longer a peculiar name\, he was a star\, even an American icon. He was also someone you knew\, a guy you wished you could have a drink and share a laugh with. He had the same joys and desires\, disappointments and fears you had\, and some of his songs--"Lazy River\," "Heart and Soul"-- became so familiar they sounded as if no one had written them\, they'd just always been there.	0

COL title VAL Lady in Black COL performer VAL Dorsetshire	COL video title VAL Uriah Heep - Lady in Black COL channel name VAL TheDeZyx COL description VAL http://www.discogs.com/artist/Uriah+Heep http://www.myspace.com/uriaheep  Uriah Heep's by-the-books progressive heavy metal made the British band one of the most popular hard rock groups of the early '70s. Formed by vocalist David Byron and guitarist Mick Box in the late '60s\, the group went through an astonishing number of members over the next two decades — nearly 30 different musicians passed through the band over the years. Byron and Box were members of the mid-'60s rock band called the Stalkers; once that band broke up\, the duo formed another group called Spice. Spice would eventually turn into Uriah Heep in the late '60s\, once Ken Hensley (guitar\, keyboards\, vocals) and bassist Paul Newton joined the pair. Former Spice drummer Alex Napier was the band's drummer for a brief time; he was quickly replaced by Nigel Olsson. Uriah Heep released their debut album Very 'eavy...Very 'umble (called Uriah Heep in the U.S.) in 1970. After its release\, Keith Baker became the group's drummer; he recorded Salisbury\, the group's second album\, before deciding he couldn't keep up with the band's extensive touring and was replaced by Ian Clarke. Salisbury\, featuring a 16-minute title track recorded with a 26-piece orchestra\, showcased the band's more progressive tendencies. Later that year\, Ian Clarke was replaced by Lee Kerslake and Mark Clarke replaced Newton; Mark Clarke quickly left the band and Gary Thain became the group's bassist. This lineup of Uriah Heep was its most stable and popular; beginning with 1972's Demons and Wizards\, they released five albums between 1972 and 1975. After 1975\, the band's popularity began to slip. Byron left the band in 1977 and was replaced by John Lawton\, yet the group's fortunes kept declining right into the early '80s. However\, Uriah Heep soldiered on\, continuing to release albums into the '90s and 2000s. The album roster included Different World (1994)\, Sea of Light (1995)\, Sonic Origami (1998)\, and Spellbinder (1999).	1

Huh?  They've got to insult us to sway others Because they're missin' the missin' links Get God removed from the situation They've got to prove these other theories  They should've learned they're playin' with fire They could get burned\, but they get numb Look at that drama they got from trickin' us with Java Man  Ain't that guy handsome?

(Brown's Sex Machine double album\, also released in 1970\, contains a different\, 11-minute-long performance of the song rather than the version released as a single.)  "Sex Machine" was one of the first songs Brown recorded with his new band\, The J.B.'s. In comparison with his 1960s funk hits such as "Papa's Got A Brand New Bag" and "Cold Sweat"\, it is notable for the de-emphasis of the horn section. Instead\, the song centers on the insistent riff played by brothers Bootsy and Catfish Collins on bass and guitar and Jabo Starks on drums\, along with the call and response interplay between Brown and Bobby Byrd's vocals.  The original single version of "Sex Machine" begins with a brief spoken dialogue between Brown and the members of his band\, which was recreated (with minor variations) in live performances: Fellas\, I'm ready to get up and do my thing! (Yeah! That's right! Do it!) I want to get into it\, man\, you know? (Go ahead! Yeah!) Like a\, like a sex machine\, man\, (Yeah!) movin'\, doin' it\, y'know? (Yeah!) Can I count it off? (Okay! Alright!) One\, two\, three\, four!  The song's freeform lyrics consist mostly of Brown's exhortations to "Get up / stay on the scene / like a sex machine" along with Byrd's regular shouts of "Get on up." The piece is harmonically static\, aside from a move to the subdominant on the bridge.  In 2004\, "Sex Machine" was ranked number 326 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest songs of all time.  Other versions  Brown recorded a reworking of the original song for his 1975 album Sex Machine Today.  The Flying Lizards recorded a successful cover of "Sex Machine" in 1984 which appeared on their album Top Ten.  In 1986 the Japanese musician Haruomi Hosono and his band F.O.E. recorded vocal and instrumental cover versions of "Sex Machine" for the album F.O.E. #1: Sex\, Energy and Star. The instrumental version featured a guest solo by Brown's longtime saxophonist Maceo Parker.  German comedian and jazz musician Helge Schneider recorded a comedic version of the song for his 1995 album Es rappelt im Karton. It was also released as a single with an accompanying video that features Schneider walking around a metro station making faces.  The rock band Widespread Panic covered the song on their 2004 live album Jackassolantern.  Jazz fusion/Blues guitarist Larry Coryell covered the song on his album Electric.  Sampling  Sy Smith and her back-up singer LeJon Walker sampled the song during their performance of "Think (About It)"\, which is featured on her DVD Sy Smith Live: Worship at the Temple.  Appearances in other media  "Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine" has appeared in a number of feature films\, including City of God\, Twisted\, Legally Blonde\, Lock\, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\, Friday and The Tuxedo (in which it is performed by Jackie Chan). It has also been used in an episode of the television sitcom Scrubs and in commercials for the Renault Clio and Tassimo. The song was featured on the Pontiac commercial.  The song figures prominently in the 2003 Japanese film Get Up!\, a comedy about a James Brown-obsessed yakuza gangster. The film's title (which transliterates into Japanese as Geroppa!) is taken from the song's lyrics.  British satirical puppet show Spitting Image ended an episode with an opera-style cover of the song\, starring Luciano Pavarotti.  Part 1 of "Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine" is available as downloadable content for the Rock Band series of video games.	0

With very different vocal tones and style\, Beccy and Melinda do great justice to a generous amount of iconic tracks on their duet album. I chose this recording\, as the best known (although not the original) version by Juice Newton is pretty hard to top. but these two ladies give it a red hot go! I love the unique qualities they bring to this set\, and they seem to be having a great old time doing it\, as well. They filmed a very cute vid for their version of '9 to 5' - check it out - it gives people a sense of the performers and their great approach. Melinda is the daughter of yodelling superstar Mary Schneider\, and Beccy's mum Carole Sturtzel was regarded as the Queen of Country Music in South Australia. For me it is a lovely opportunity here to be able to post a clip of these two wonderful daughters and celebrate the terrific careers they have both carved out for themselves. Both have multiple Golden Guitar awards (Australia's Country Music Prizes) and have scored many hits from their already prolific catalogues.   Happy Mother's Day to all the wonderful Mums out there.	0

We recorded it analogue to tape in the wonderful AGM studio. So nice to work with Christoffer there it was two wonderful days. Thanks Hannes\, Charlie\, Lefvande Bilder and Christoffer for all this! / Wintergatan  About the occasion: The Swedish charity magazine Faktum asked several artists to record a song each for the compilation album "Det ordnar sig" meaning "it will be OK" in english. Wintergatan was asked to record Visa Från Utanmyra\, a swedish folksong made famous by late swedish piano player Jan Johansson. Don´t miss out on listening to his wonderful version of the song\, we wanted to capture that same feeling without doing it in the exact same way. The album is being sold by Faktum street sellers in Gothenburg and Malmö.  If you want to support what we do:  If you want to support: The fact that you are watching the videos and care about the music and future of Wintergatan is the best support anyone can have\, I want to thank everyone who is here for that kind of support\, it is really the fuel for the Wintergatan Engine.  Why do we accept support in this way? I\, Martin\, can already sustain myself 100% doing what I love to do. If you want to support artists/organisations who have not yet reached that privileged position\, please consider supporting other artists/organisations who need the support more. With that said\, I have too many ideas and too little time and with your support I can get more help from people around me to execute the ideas better and bring them out in the world faster.

Thomas\, Bill Medley\, Chuck Leavell and Judith Hill  Ever since his glorious surprise version of “The Way You Look Tonight” in the 1991 film “Father of The Bride” paved the way for his extraordinary second career as a GRAMMY Award winning vocalist/producer\, Steve Tyrell has been setting A New Standard (the title of his 1999 debut album) for interpreting the Great American Songbook – most notably on Songs of Sinatra (which reached #5 on the Billboard Jazz Albums chart) and his most recent Concord Records release\, It’s Magic: The Songs of Sammy Cahn (#2). On his 11th album\, That Lovin’ Feeling\, he celebrates what he calls “the Great American Songbook 2; the next generation of the Songbook\,” recording seminal rock era classics penned by legendary songwriters (many renowned for hits penned at New York’s famed Brill Building) who are also cherished longtime friends.   While sharing the enduring magic of timeless songs by the songwriting teams of Carole King and Gerry Goffin\, Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller\, Barry Mann & Cynthia Weil and Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich as well as Burt Bacharach\, Neil Sedaka\, Toni Wine and Carole Bayer Sager\, That Lovin’ Feeling sets itself apart from most tribute recordings with spirited guest vocal appearances by Mann\, B.J. Thomas\, Neil Sedaka and Bill Medley in addition to renowned backup singer Judith Hill (featured in the Oscar winning documentary “20 Feet From Stardom”) and Tyrell’s daughter Lauryn Tyrell.

His first recordings were in the Cool Jazz style and after his collaboration with Martin Denny he finally created his very own style \, excelling in moody  Vibraphone /Marimba dominated modern Hawaiian Jazz.. Adventures was originally composed by Lionel Newman \, a member of a great  composers dynasty . It was created as TV theme for the popular TV series \, wich is introduced in this video at the first 17 seconds .The first series ran from 1958 till 1961. Lyman recorded "Adventures " in 1961  on the Ryckodisc label.It was part of the  famous Yellow Bird album. Starring in this video are also some guest stars from the TV series back then. The eclectic sound of Lyman's music justifys a good audiosystem \, or the use of headphones.These records were produced by the sound engineer Richard Vaughn in the beginning day's of stereo recording \, and were quite inventive in those day's.

COL title VAL One Dance COL performer VAL Travis Atreo	COL video title VAL Crosby\, Stills & Nash - Helplessly Hoping (With Lyrics) COL channel name VAL Hoodoo You Love? COL description VAL "Helplessly Hoping" is the 8th track off of their debut self titled album\, "Crosby\, Stills & Nash" from 1969. This song is one of my favorites by CSN and the harmonies are particularly good. Just sit back\, listen and enjoy a truly beautiful song with great lyrics.  Lyrics:  Helplessly hoping Her harlequin hovers nearby Awaiting a word Gasping at glimpses Of gentle true spirit He runs\, wishing he could fly Only to trip at the sound of good-bye  Wordlessly watching He waits by the window And wonders  At the empty place inside Heartlessly helping himself to her bad dreams He worries Did he hear a good-bye? Or even hello?  They are one person They are two alone They are three together They are for each other  Stand by the stairway You'll see something Certain to tell you confusion has its cost Love isn't lying It's loose in a lady who lingers Saying she is lost And choking on hello  They are one person They are two alone They are three together They are for each other	0

Draper (25 enero 1923 hasta 28 marzo 2003)\,  conocido profesionalmente como Rusty Draper \, era un cantante americano de Pop que logró su mayor éxito en la década de 1950.  Nacido en Kirksville\, Missouri (el apodo de "Rusty" era por su pelo rojo) comenzó a actuar en el programa de radio de su tío en Tulsa \, Oklahoma a mediados de la década de 1930. Draper pasó a trabajar en las estaciones de radio en Des Moines \, Iowa  (veces tomando el lugar del locutor deportivo Ronald Reagan) \, y en Illinois antes de instalarse en California . Allí comenzó a cantar en  clubes \, convirtiéndose en el cantante oficial del casino de San Francisco . A principios de la década de 1950 había empezado a aparecer en programas de televisión nacionales\, incluyendo The Ed Sullivan Show (CBS) y Ozark Jubilee (ABC).  En 1952\, Draper firmó con Mercury Records y lanzó su primera grabación  \, "How Could You (ojos azules)". Al año siguiente\, después de una gira nacional de clubes\, su versión de  Jim Lowe's "Gambler's Guitar" 's llegó al N º 6 en las listas de éxitos de todo el paçis\, y vendió un millón de copias\, consiguiendo  un disco de oro.  Tras una serie de éxitos menores\, volvió a lo más alto en 1955 con "Seventeen" (N º 18)\, "El Shifting\, Whispering Sands" (N º 3) y "Are You Satisfied?" (No. 11)\, convirtiéndose en uno de los cantantes  de pop  con más éxito de la época.  En 1962\, firmó con con Monument Records \, con cada vez menos éxito en las listas ya que su estilo se fue quedando anticuado. Sin embargo\, él continuó teniendo éxitos menores durante la década de 1960.  Apareció en musicales de teatro y en la televisión\,  Draper murió de neumonía \, en Bellevue\, Washington \, a la edad de 80 años.

COL title VAL Just a Dream COL performer VAL The William Clarke Band	COL video title VAL Ken Griffin – I Need You Nou COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Ken Griffin  Kenneth W. "Ken" Griffin (December 28\, 1909 – March 11\, 1956) was an American organist. Griffin was born in Columbia\, Missouri. His biggest hit was "You Can't Be True\, Dear" (1948)\, which was first released as an instrumental\, and later that year re-released with a vocal by Jerry Wayne dubbed in. Both versions became popular\, selling over 3.5 million copies. He also starred in a 1954-55 syndicated television series\, 67 Melody Lane. He recorded on a variety of record labels including Columbia and Rondo. It was in the 1940s in Aurora\, Illinois that Griffin broke into the nightclub circuit\, playing at the Rivoli Cafe nightly. The sessions at the Rivoli cafe were broadcast on the radio station\, WMRO\, and the program became popular. Griffin died on March 11\, 1956 in Chicago\, Illinois at the age of 46\, of a heart attack and was buried at Lincoln Memorial Park in Aurora. Columbia had many hours of Griffin's unreleased recordings on tape\, and continued to release "new" recordings of Griffin's music for a number of years after his death.

COL title VAL Ain't That Loving COL performer VAL Dennis Brown	COL video title VAL cruel to be kind\, cover\, pitwork\, 1999\, clover records COL channel name VAL pitworkwork COL description VAL review by Mike DaRonco  Pitwork can be easily compared to a warm summer day on a playground: innocent\, bouncy\, and full of energy. Cheesy metaphors aside\, this Japanese duo minimally incorporates playful pop and an eclectic use of instruments: from the basic structure of drums\, bass\, and guitar to drum machines and harmonica to even a canned audience. Happy-go-lucky all the way through\, this self-titled EP manages to cover some new ground in indie pop without being overly sentimental or experimental. Fans of Tiger Trap\, the Softies and Stereolab should take notice.	0

The dust has only just begun to fall\, Crop circles in the carpet\, sinking\, feeling. Spin me 'round again and rub my eyes. This can't be happening. When busy streets amass with people Would stop to hold their heads heavy.  Hide and seek. Trains and sewing machines. All those years they were here first.  Oily marks appear on walls Where pleasure moments hung before. The takeover\, the sweeping insensitivity of this still life.  Hide and seek. Trains and sewing machines.

Rob Ivey (Batching It)  http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#!/pages/Batching-It/141041665946741 http://www.myspace.com/batchingit09 http://www.twitter.com/batching_it  From Batching It's debut album "Homage".  The Unforgiven as originally performed by Metallica.  Batching It is a one-man punk-rock cover band featuring Rob Ivey\, a San Francisco East Bay musician. Hailing from Vallejo\, CA\, Rob was previously in Vallejo bands Bottomdawg and The V-Town Have-Nots \, and also played drums in Diabolical Exploits with veteran punk-rock producer Andy Ernst\, who has produced such notable bands as Green Day\, Rancid\, and AFI.  The name 'Batching It' is short for 'batcheloring it'\, or 'going it alone'\, which perfectly describes the philosophy behind the project. After many years of not being in a band\, Rob's nostalgia kicked in and he decided that it was time to make a cover album of influential bands/songs\, songs and bands that inspired him to become a musician in his teenage years. The first Batching It project\, due out in the Fall of 2009 on Leficit Records\, is called 'Homage' - a self-explanatory title. Rob wanted to pay tribute to these bands and songs by reintroducing them to the new generation\, and covered in Rob's personal favorite styles.  Recorded at the legendary Art of Ears studio in Hayward\, CA by Andy Ernst\, and produced by Mike Lawson of Leficit Records\, 'Homage' is a 15-track nod to\, in Rob's opinion\, 15 awesome bands: NOFX\, Skankin' Pickle\, Swingin' Utters\, Pearl Jam\, Rancid\, Lagwagon\, Metallica\, Sublime\, No Use For a Name\, Smashing Pumpkins\, Weezer\, No Doubt\, The Descendents\, Less Than Jake\, and Operation Ivy. Crossing rock genres\, just like Rob's personal tastes\, 'Homage' should have something for everyone.	1

COL title VAL Head Like a Hole COL performer VAL Justin McRoberts	COL video title VAL Betty Johnson -- I Need You Now (VintageMusic.es) COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Betty Johnson 16 de marzo 1929 (otras fuentes dicen 1931)  es una cantante norteamericana que alcanzó su pico de carrera en la década de 1950. Cuando era adolescente\, fue contratada por Columbia Records e hizo algunas grabaciones\, ninguna de las cuales tuvieron éxito. En 1951\, Percy Faith \, que la había conocido por sus grabaciones de Columbia\, trató de convencer a Mitch Miller ( A & R\, el director de Columbia) para firmar con ella\, pero Miller\, que incluye Doris Day y Rosemary Clooney \, entre los artistas que habían firmado\, no veía la necesidad firmar con ella.  Johnson lanzó el álbum para niños\, con Eddy Arnold producido por Simon and Schuster \, que posteriormente la contrató para su propio sello discográfico\, Bell Records en 1954. En el mismo año firmó un contrato con Csida-Grean\, una sociedad de gestión que había manejado la carrera de Arnold. Charles Grean\, miembro  de esa compañía\,  produjo muchas de sus grabaciones posteriores. En 1955\, firmó un contrato con RCA Victor Records \, que la envió a Chicago\, Illinois .  En Chicago\, Johnson trabajó con Arnold de nuevo en su  serie\, Eddy Arnold Time\, respaldado por un grupo que había trabajado con su familia en el Grand Ole Opry\, The Jordanaires . Este grupo más tarde fue conocido como un grupo de apoyo de Elvis Presley .  En 1957 se casó con Grean\, aunque el matrimonio sólo duraría hasta 1961\, la relación profesional continuó. Luego fue contratada por Jack Paar para su programa de televisión\, Tonight . Esto condujo a un contrato discográfico con Atlantic Records en 1957\, para el que tuvo su próximo gran éxito\, "Little Blue Man".  Johnson continuó en Tonight hasta 1962 cuando Jack Paar fue reemplazado por Johnny Carson.

Purchase from the label: http://www.paradiseofbachelors.com/shop/pob-21 Purchase from Bandcamp: https://paradiseofbachelors.bandcamp.com/album/ambsace Other options: http://lnk.to/PoB21  The second album of astonishing duets by guitarists James Elkington (who has toured and/or recorded with Jeff Tweedy\, Richard Thompson\, and Steve Gunn\, among others) and Nathan Salsburg (an accomplished soloist deemed by NPR “one of those names we’ll all associate with American folk guitar”) is a sublime suite of nimble\, filigreed compositions by two singular stylists. Belying its title—“ambsace” is the lowest throw of dice; snake eyes—the record thrives on a gentle empathy and generosity of spirit\, sitting sneakily protean original compositions alongside gorgeous arrangements of songs by Duke Ellington and The Smiths at the same big hand-hewn table.

COL title VAL Better Luck Next Time COL performer VAL Perry Como with Russ Case and His Orchestra	COL video title VAL Lorez Alexandria -- Better Luck Next Time (1959) COL channel name VAL JazzyRNA COL description VAL Continuing with saga of America's most gifted\, and underrated jazz vocalists—this particular artist takes the cake—not meaning the particular term in a negative connotation\, but it's such a pity that a remarkable songstress—the incomparable\, Lorez Alexandria is not afforded the recognition that she so deserves. This is proven true\, given the fact that I recently discovered her albums—and I just haven't had my fill. I've searched and purchased everything I could find from such a gifted songstress. Lorez crafts each lyric with such grace and tonality that could easily match (if not surpass) the reigning jazz stylists of the bop/jazz/pop age. She gives each standard a new sense of evocative meaning as far as lyrics are concerned\, and reinvents the wheel each time she unleashes her enthralling voice. As she once said "A lyric is dead\, until you breathe life into it." This is exactly what she does. Enjoy and listen in HD\, to the lovely—Lorez Alexandria. All right(s) to 1959 King Records\, Inc.	1

COL title VAL Carry Me Back to the Lone Prairie COL performer VAL Milton Brown and His Brownies	COL video title VAL Nancy Sinatra & Lee Hazlewood: Some Velvet Morning COL channel name VAL calicomoonchild COL description VAL The second song I ever really loved.   I have loved & lived with this song all my life and it is one of my favourite top 10 tracks of all time.   Track Meaning:  One day when the male character in the song is sober and has his head "straight"\, he will impart something of significance to his current love about his earliest & deepest love\, a woman named "pheadra" whose memory he is still haunted by.  Hence the repetition of the Pheadra/ Nancy portion of the song . . .  her section symbolising the "haunting" and struggle inside his head as he tries to gain "closure" from this past relationship with a mysterious former love Pheadra . . . his part of the song being directed to his new lover in the present.    His present lack of sobriety (drunkeness) describing his vain attempts to drown out the all consuming memory of this mysterious former love\, a memory that he is aware is annoying his present lover and describes his fear that she may leave him as a result of his "haunting" by his old (first)love.  Note:  At the point in history this song was written the labels of "straight" (meaning hetrosexual) and "gay" (meaning homosexual) did not yet exist.  In fact by the late sixties the term "gay" was just another word for "happy".	0

COL title VAL Everyday Will Be Like a Holiday COL performer VAL Daryl Hall & John Oates	COL video title VAL Ruby Wright - Bimbo COL channel name VAL AFantasticVoyage COL description VAL VARIOUS: THEN 1954  1954 -- now\, that's what we call an exceptional year! Perhaps best remembered in Britain for the end of rationing after 14 years\, 1954 also saw the marriage of Marilyn Monroe to Joe Di Maggio\, the first royal tour of Australia\, the breaking of the four-minute mile by runner Roger Bannister\, and the first World Cup to be televised.  Much memorable music was also made that year\, and you can hear many of the most popular hits from back then right now on THEN 1954\, continuing the new series from Fantastic Voyage\, the label that brings you the highly popular British Hit Parade compilations. Unlike that series\, which provides two multi-disc sets per year intended for the serious chart completists out there\, the THEN series has the more casual music buyer in mind.  Although THEN 1953 includes many UK and US chart-toppers\, the series is not constrained by chart position or label in its aim of presenting the most memorable sounds of each year. Successive volumes of THEN will follow over the coming months. Each one is compiled and annotated by eminent chartwatcher Dave McAleer\, the former chief consultant and contributor to the now defunct Guinness Book Of British Hit Singles\, who is currently devising pop quiz books for the Official Charts Company and assisting with the Virgin Book Of British Hit Albums.  Dave's sleeve notes spend as much time recalling the news events of the year as they do exploring the musical highlights. If you are looking to build up a library of the most enduring British hits from each year\, THEN is the series for you. If you are looking for a souvenir of a particular year -- to remember a birth\, a first kiss\, or a wedding -- THEN will provide the soundtrack to those memories.	0

Purchase from the label: http://www.paradiseofbachelors.com/shop/pob-21 Purchase from Bandcamp: https://paradiseofbachelors.bandcamp.com/album/ambsace Other options: http://lnk.to/PoB21  The second album of astonishing duets by guitarists James Elkington (who has toured and/or recorded with Jeff Tweedy\, Richard Thompson\, and Steve Gunn\, among others) and Nathan Salsburg (an accomplished soloist deemed by NPR “one of those names we’ll all associate with American folk guitar”) is a sublime suite of nimble\, filigreed compositions by two singular stylists. Belying its title—“ambsace” is the lowest throw of dice; snake eyes—the record thrives on a gentle empathy and generosity of spirit\, sitting sneakily protean original compositions alongside gorgeous arrangements of songs by Duke Ellington and The Smiths at the same big hand-hewn table.

COL title VAL Little Old Lady COL performer VAL Hoagy Carmichael with Glen Gray and The Casa Loma Orchestra	COL video title VAL Uriah Heep - Lady in Black COL channel name VAL TheDeZyx COL description VAL http://www.discogs.com/artist/Uriah+Heep http://www.myspace.com/uriaheep  Uriah Heep's by-the-books progressive heavy metal made the British band one of the most popular hard rock groups of the early '70s. Formed by vocalist David Byron and guitarist Mick Box in the late '60s\, the group went through an astonishing number of members over the next two decades — nearly 30 different musicians passed through the band over the years. Byron and Box were members of the mid-'60s rock band called the Stalkers; once that band broke up\, the duo formed another group called Spice. Spice would eventually turn into Uriah Heep in the late '60s\, once Ken Hensley (guitar\, keyboards\, vocals) and bassist Paul Newton joined the pair. Former Spice drummer Alex Napier was the band's drummer for a brief time; he was quickly replaced by Nigel Olsson. Uriah Heep released their debut album Very 'eavy...Very 'umble (called Uriah Heep in the U.S.) in 1970. After its release\, Keith Baker became the group's drummer; he recorded Salisbury\, the group's second album\, before deciding he couldn't keep up with the band's extensive touring and was replaced by Ian Clarke. Salisbury\, featuring a 16-minute title track recorded with a 26-piece orchestra\, showcased the band's more progressive tendencies. Later that year\, Ian Clarke was replaced by Lee Kerslake and Mark Clarke replaced Newton; Mark Clarke quickly left the band and Gary Thain became the group's bassist. This lineup of Uriah Heep was its most stable and popular; beginning with 1972's Demons and Wizards\, they released five albums between 1972 and 1975. After 1975\, the band's popularity began to slip. Byron left the band in 1977 and was replaced by John Lawton\, yet the group's fortunes kept declining right into the early '80s. However\, Uriah Heep soldiered on\, continuing to release albums into the '90s and 2000s. The album roster included Different World (1994)\, Sea of Light (1995)\, Sonic Origami (1998)\, and Spellbinder (1999).	0

COL title VAL You're a Grand Old Flag COL performer VAL Del Wood	COL video title VAL You're A Grand Old Flag - Billy Murray and The American Quartet (Victor)1917 COL channel name VAL althazarr's good time oldies COL description VAL Recorded June 4\, 1917.  "You're a Grand Old Flag" is a patriotic song of the United States. The song\, a spirited march written by George M. Cohan\, is a tribute to the U.S. flag. In addition to obvious references to the flag\, it incorporates snippets of other popular songs\, including one of his own. Cohan wrote it in 1906 for George Washington\, Jr.\, his stage musical.  The song was first publicly performed on February 6\, the play's opening night\, at Herald Square Theater in New York City. "You're a Grand Old Flag" quickly became the first song from a musical to sell over a million copies of sheet music. The title and first lyric comes from someone Cohan once met; the Library of Congress website notes:  The original lyric for this perennial George M. Cohan favorite came\, as Cohan later explained\, from an encounter he had with a Civil War veteran who fought at Gettysburg. The two men found themselves next to each other and Cohan noticed the vet held a carefully folded but ragged old flag. The man reportedly then turned to Cohan and said\, "She's a grand old rag." Cohan thought it was a great line and originally named his tune "You're a Grand Old Rag." So many groups and individuals objected to calling the flag a "rag\," however\, that he "gave 'em what they wanted" and switched words\, renaming the song "You're a Grand Old Flag." — Library of Congress	1

He performed in a range of music genres\, including pop\, rock'n'roll\, folk\, and country.    He started as a songwriter for Connie Francis\, and recorded his own first million-seller "Splish Splash" in 1958. This was followed by "Dream Lover"\, "Mack the Knife"\, and "Beyond the Sea"\, which brought him world fame. In 1962\, he won a Golden Globe for his first film Come September\, co-starring his first wife\, Sandra Dee.    Throughout the 1960s\, he became more politically active and worked on Robert Kennedy's Democratic presidential campaign. He was present on the night of June 4/5\, 1968\, at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles at the time of Kennedy's assassination. The same year\, he discovered that he had been brought up by his grandmother\, not his mother\, and that the girl he had thought to be his sister was actually his mother. These events deeply affected Darin and sent him into a long period of seclusion	0

I lay there in the sun And felt it caressing my face As I fell asleep And dreamed. I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie And that I was the star of the movie. This really blew my mind\, The fact that me\, An overfed\, long-haired\, leaping gnome\, Should be the star of a Hollywood movie. Hmm\, but there I was. I was taken to a place\, The hall of the mountain king. I stood high upon a mountain top\, Naked to the world\, In front of every kind of girl. There was long ones\, tall ones\, short ones\, brown ones\, Black ones\, round ones\, big ones\, crazy ones. Out of the middle Came a lady. She whispered in my ear Something crazy. She said\, Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl." I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back As she disappeared\, But soon she returned. In her hand was a bottle of wine\, In the other\, a glass. She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass And raised it to her lips And\, just before she drank it\, She said\, Take the wine\, take that girl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl." Take that pearl\, yeah. It's on girl\, all you gotta do is spill that wine\, spill that wine. Let me feel\, let me feel fine\, yeah\, yeah. Spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, take that pearl.	0

Griffin died on March 11\, 1956 in Chicago\, Illinois at the age of 46\, of a heart attack and was buried at Lincoln Memorial Park in Aurora. Columbia had many hours of Griffin's unreleased recordings on tape\, and continued to release "new" recordings of Griffin's music for a number of years after his death.

It was released in Australia in mid 1975 on a Bootleg 45\, BL-249. It charted in Adelaide (# 37)\, but failed to find much favour anywhere else in Australia.

A good Jack Jones take   but then did Jones do otherwise than good interpretations  .. What can you say about Sarah Vaughan apart from " the best" The dispute is less active but thirty plus  years ago   you could  get a conversation about who is the greatest jazz singer  or even what is a jazz singer. it encouraged many into print  with aspirants spreading themselves on the   quidditas of singing.  Louis  Armstrong for whom some flew a flag as greatest jazz  singer. may I respectfully dissent. The  big  three  for  me and  seemingly many ~ . Operatic voiced Sarah   Vaughan ~Virtuoso  scat  singer  but also excellent straight ballad singer  Ella Fitzgerald ~and for those with a yen for tragedy Billie Holiday.  but many many more  ~  some not getting respect deserved.Some skirting jazz~  a Raincheck ~ In the 1960s or a little later  I had an album by a singer since died but underlining the cross border nature of music from show tunes   to jazz.  singer  Carol Ventura . Nowadays  a name  sadly  for a pub quiz  but Ventura was a skilled singer especially remembered Everybody says Dont (musical Anyone can Whistle) and another number Bye Bye Just checked U Tube and its not there  so  quite a deal  of music still missing from internet  but lets pay tribute to 87 year old veteran jazz arranger  saxist  Benny Golson who scored Ventura's albums a talent in the vicinity of Quincy Jones.  I have some live Golson visuals from 1965( at least i hope I still jhave from  a  BBC session   featuring Tubby Hayes in the saxes.   The great thing the  aforementioned  female trio   Vaughan Fitzgerald Holiday don t clash ~ each with unique  vocal   attributes  True  Ella and Sarah   have similarities both possessed of phenomenal  vocal virtuosity  and quite obviously rejoicing in their    special vocal gifts.  and  that white heat art creativity   led to   prolific  legacies  A time when skill in musical art was paramount  in performance. something that nosedived or perhaps simply changed  as the years passed   but that's another story . Unlike the greats of yore  todays  pop music  depends   less on  interpretative skills. Although her voice was ragged  by that   time ( comparatively speaking   but always musical ) Ella late in her career did a live Basie Album  that still swings like billy~o.Ella's  1950s   1960s  songbooks  with voice in full loom  are   a treasure of popular music.  I know rockers and latterday musos want to protect their music as special but  another prejudice? For me the best  popular music   of 20th  century     starts and ends with George Gershwin Harold Arlen Cole Porter Richard Rodgers  and  other  mid century  songwriters   with  songs  marked   by many things not least versatility  in interpretation not just in a jazz way..  An attractive understated I Will say Goodbye   on  U Tube  from 1972  but then Lena Horne  could   easily  do  linear  understated  interpretations  amidst her blitzing  up tempos numbers. The arrangement seems Legrand and better for it.  Pity   Everybody says Dont  is less heard nowadays Barbra Streisand also had her  say on that show tune . Not one to say boo about Streisand and her vocal technique  but I probably prefer Ventura on the song. Theres a lot of  vocal  exertion in the Streisand version ~ Ifcopod thats what the song is about a sort of patter song going like the clappers .Nonetheless~(  IIfcopods desperate bid for credibility  as the ship sinks) ~I prefer the   more deliberate gait of Ventura  version.  But if there is an implicit agenda  to this  erudite spiel Consider the numerous( literally) singers who  like Ventura  just  got one stab at success. Luckily we have the CDs or more likely vinyls.   This has nothing to do with anything just wanted to share the thought. In the 1970s I had a great live Buddy Greco album  recorded in the UK  doing among other things   youve guessed it  his party piece  Thats why Thats  why  the  Lady is a Tramp. the album~ vinyl disappeared but not memories  of Buddy  swinging like crazy  doing what he did so well. A great version.	0

COL title VAL Thy Burdens Are Greater Than Mine COL performer VAL Hank Williams and His Guitar	COL video title VAL Bob Wills & His Texas Playboys - Yearning Just for You (1938) COL channel name VAL ASACurator COL description VAL Bob Wills was the driving force behind Western Swing\, a form of Country & Western that fuses Jazz\, Hillbilly\, Blues\, Big Band Swing\, and many more rhythm forms together creating a  truly Unique\, Diverse and Unforgettable sound. Wills' shrewd mix of horns\, fiddles and steel guitar made for a swinging sound that grabbed the public's ear during the mid 1930s and 1940s. Bob Wills was born into a family of fiddlers on March 6\, 1905. His father\, John Wills  regularly won Texas fiddling competitions. Bob learned how to play fiddle and mandolin from his father. As a young man\, Wills performed at house dances\, medicine shows and in 1929 made his debut on the radio.  With commercial sponsorship\, Wills' bands performed on radio in the early 1930s as "Aladdin's Laddies" (for the Aladdin Lamp Co.) and "The Light Crust Doughboys" (for Light Crust Flour). Following a salary dispute\, Wills renamed his band the Texas Playboys and relocated to Tulsa\, Oklahoma\, where he had a live radio show. This exposure led to a contract with the American Recording Corporation - later absorbed into Columbia Records. In September 1935\, Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys recorded their first songs in a makeshift  recording studio in an old Dallas Warehouse. From that point on\, The Texas Playboys became an overnight sensation and recorded prolifically and made such classics as "Steel Guitar Rag"\, "Maiden's Prayer"\, "Take Me Back to Tulsa" and Wills' signature song\, "San Antonio Rose".  Their biggest hit\, was "New Spanish Two Step"\, which topped the country charts for 16 weeks in 1946. The Texas Playboys always had fine singers like Tommy Duncan and Leon McAuliffe\, and Wills punctuated the tunes with jive talking\, falsetto asides and cries of "Ah-ha!" He'd call out soloists by name and instrument\, good-naturedly goading them on to rollicking solo performances. In terms of personnel\, The Texas Playboys expanded and contracted over the years\, according to Wills' desires and the whims of the market. At one point the Texas Playboys were 22 pieces strong\, although the band more typically numbered between 9 and 18 members. There were personnel changes and musical shifts as Wills struggled to adapt to the changing face of  America in the postwar era. Nonetheless\, there was always a solid core of loyal regulars in The Texas Playboys. After leaving Columbia in 1947\, Wills continued to record prolifically for such labels as MGM\, Decca\, Longhorn and Kapp. The group also toured the country and often performed  at a Wills-owned dancehall in Sacramento\, California. In 1968\, Wills was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. A year later\, he suffered a debilitating stroke. There were reunions and recording sessions with many of the old Texas Playboys in 1971 and 1973. Wills' final stroke came in his sleep following the first day of a recording session in December 1973 that resulted in the double album "For the Last Time". Confined to a wheelchair\, he'd reprised his role as bandleader that day with a group of musicians that included former Texas Playboys. He never regained consciousness and died 18 months later on May 13\, 1975. Wills has been revered by such country-music legends as Waylon Jennings\, Willie Nelson\, George Straight\, and Merle Haggard who made a 1976 remake of Bob's 1941 hit "Cherokee Maiden". The contemporary Western Swing group\, Asleep at the Wheel has also cut a pair of tribute albums that have kept Wills' name before the public. Every year\, Bob Wills Day is celebrated on the last Saturday in April in Turkey\, Texas.	0

With very different vocal tones and style\, Beccy and Melinda do great justice to a generous amount of iconic tracks on their duet album. I chose this recording\, as the best known (although not the original) version by Juice Newton is pretty hard to top. but these two ladies give it a red hot go! I love the unique qualities they bring to this set\, and they seem to be having a great old time doing it\, as well. They filmed a very cute vid for their version of '9 to 5' - check it out - it gives people a sense of the performers and their great approach. Melinda is the daughter of yodelling superstar Mary Schneider\, and Beccy's mum Carole Sturtzel was regarded as the Queen of Country Music in South Australia. For me it is a lovely opportunity here to be able to post a clip of these two wonderful daughters and celebrate the terrific careers they have both carved out for themselves. Both have multiple Golden Guitar awards (Australia's Country Music Prizes) and have scored many hits from their already prolific catalogues.   Happy Mother's Day to all the wonderful Mums out there.	0

COL title VAL My Attorney Bernie COL performer VAL Blossom Dearie	COL video title VAL IRENE REID I wonder where our love has gone (1965) COL channel name VAL OubaelPhoumet COL description VAL album : Room for one more.  Room for One More pairs singer Irene Reid with arranger Oliver Nelson and a sprawling who's who of session players including Thad Jones\, Charlie Mariano\, Kenny Burrell\, Phil Woods\, and J.J. Johnson. The title's more than a bit tongue in cheek\, of course\, but given the stature of her collaborators\, Reid no doubt felt some pressure to prove herself worthy of occupying the same studio space\, let alone to claim top billing\, but she does so admirably\, rendering classics like "Save Your Love for Me" and "I Wonder Where Our Love Has Gone" with extraordinary emotional potency. Although best suited for ballads\, most notably a breathtaking reading of "Who Can I Turn To?\," Reid is such a nimble stylist that even a throwaway number like the Bewitched theme still makes its mark. Nelson's spacious arrangements are sublime\, and it almost goes without saying that the band is exemplary. In short\, a wonderful if little-known LP in desperate need of reissue.	0

Purchase from the label: http://www.paradiseofbachelors.com/shop/pob-21 Purchase from Bandcamp: https://paradiseofbachelors.bandcamp.com/album/ambsace Other options: http://lnk.to/PoB21  The second album of astonishing duets by guitarists James Elkington (who has toured and/or recorded with Jeff Tweedy\, Richard Thompson\, and Steve Gunn\, among others) and Nathan Salsburg (an accomplished soloist deemed by NPR “one of those names we’ll all associate with American folk guitar”) is a sublime suite of nimble\, filigreed compositions by two singular stylists. Belying its title—“ambsace” is the lowest throw of dice; snake eyes—the record thrives on a gentle empathy and generosity of spirit\, sitting sneakily protean original compositions alongside gorgeous arrangements of songs by Duke Ellington and The Smiths at the same big hand-hewn table.

"Ken" Griffin (December 28\, 1909 – March 11\, 1956) was an American organist. Griffin was born in Columbia\, Missouri. His biggest hit was "You Can't Be True\, Dear" (1948)\, which was first released as an instrumental\, and later that year re-released with a vocal by Jerry Wayne dubbed in. Both versions became popular\, selling over 3.5 million copies. He also starred in a 1954-55 syndicated television series\, 67 Melody Lane. He recorded on a variety of record labels including Columbia and Rondo. It was in the 1940s in Aurora\, Illinois that Griffin broke into the nightclub circuit\, playing at the Rivoli Cafe nightly. The sessions at the Rivoli cafe were broadcast on the radio station\, WMRO\, and the program became popular. Griffin died on March 11\, 1956 in Chicago\, Illinois at the age of 46\, of a heart attack and was buried at Lincoln Memorial Park in Aurora. Columbia had many hours of Griffin's unreleased recordings on tape\, and continued to release "new" recordings of Griffin's music for a number of years after his death.

Now stop your whistle blowin' 'Cause I got ways of knowin' Your bringin' other people's lovers But my own keeps goin' Train of love's deceivin' When she's not gone she's leavin'  Every so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam But everybody's baby but mine's comin' home.  Train of love's now hastin' Sweethearts standin' waitin' Here and there and everywhere They're gonna be embracin' Trainman tell me maybe Ain't you got my baby  Every so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam But everybody's baby but mine's comin' home.  Train of love is leavin' Leavin' my heart grievin' Bur early or late\, I sit and wait Because I'm still believin' We'll walk away together Though I may wait forever  Every so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam But everybody's baby but mine's comin' home.	0

COL title VAL Never Let Me Go COL performer VAL William Bell	COL video title VAL Ruth Brown - Never Let Me Go COL channel name VAL sanny blues COL description VAL A Good Day For The Blues ....Ruth Brown (1928-2006) was a rhythm & blues singer-songwriter\, record producer\, composer and actress noted for bringing a pop music style to rhythm & blues music. Backed by a bevy of New Orleans jazz and soul vets\, Brown delivers a series of horn-inflected\, indigo ballads like "Never Let Me Go\," "True\," and "The Richest One" that unearth the blues with an unruffled dignity reminiscent of Nina Simone or a less fragile Billie Holiday. On most of the rest of the material\, Brown invokes her Broadway experience to become the archetypal blues mama who "don't take no mess." In that vein\, "H.B.'s Funky Fable" is a humorous talk-sung tale for kids of all ages\, and "Cabbage Head" resurrects the minstrel-vaudeville days of Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith with hilarious aplomb\, as Brown nails the bawdy vernacular and trumpeter Abram Wilson spools out brassy asides that evoke the period perfectly.	1

Eindringlich\, lasziv\, ganz nah."   Elly Lapp liebt die Brückenschläge. Für sie sind UFA-Schlager und Popmusik keine  unarrangierbaren Gegensätze\, sondern interpretatorische Herausforderung. Dabei ist eine sehr moderne CD entstanden\,  die gleichzeitig sehr intensiv und sehr persönlich ist. Viel näher geht`s nicht.   Es waren große Songs -- es sind große Songs. Dazu leistet eine interessante Interpretin ihren Beitrag. Elly Lapp. Die studierte Schauspielerin und Sängerin tourt mit eigenen Programmen durch Deutschland -- und sie war die Stimme des Titelsongs der erfolgreichen ARD-Fernsehserie „Kir Royal".  „Der Wind hat mir ein Lied erzählt" - gleichzeitig erste Single - und „Ich steh` im Regen" sind Versuche einer ungewöhnlichen Verbindung von UFA - HIT und POPSOUND. Zarah Leander machte einst diese Songs zu Welterfolgen. Damals hatten die Autoren wohl nie eine Umsetzung mit rockigen Gitarren oder Saxophon im Auge. Hier geben die modernen Instrumente\, wie das gesamte Pop- Arrangement\, eine ganz neue Farbe -- voller Intensität.  Doch die CD von Elly Lapp zeigt die großen Filmhits nicht nur im Popgewand\, sondern auch sehr sparsam\, kunstvoll arrangiert\, als Chansons mit großer interpretatorischer Tiefe.  z.B."

COL title VAL Jesse COL performer VAL Scott Matthew	COL video title VAL IRENE REID I wonder where our love has gone (1965) COL channel name VAL OubaelPhoumet COL description VAL album : Room for one more.  Room for One More pairs singer Irene Reid with arranger Oliver Nelson and a sprawling who's who of session players including Thad Jones\, Charlie Mariano\, Kenny Burrell\, Phil Woods\, and J.J. Johnson. The title's more than a bit tongue in cheek\, of course\, but given the stature of her collaborators\, Reid no doubt felt some pressure to prove herself worthy of occupying the same studio space\, let alone to claim top billing\, but she does so admirably\, rendering classics like "Save Your Love for Me" and "I Wonder Where Our Love Has Gone" with extraordinary emotional potency. Although best suited for ballads\, most notably a breathtaking reading of "Who Can I Turn To?\," Reid is such a nimble stylist that even a throwaway number like the Bewitched theme still makes its mark. Nelson's spacious arrangements are sublime\, and it almost goes without saying that the band is exemplary. In short\, a wonderful if little-known LP in desperate need of reissue.	0

Rob Ivey (Batching It)  http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#!/pages/Batching-It/141041665946741 http://www.myspace.com/batchingit09 http://www.twitter.com/batching_it  From Batching It's debut album "Homage".  The Unforgiven as originally performed by Metallica.  Batching It is a one-man punk-rock cover band featuring Rob Ivey\, a San Francisco East Bay musician. Hailing from Vallejo\, CA\, Rob was previously in Vallejo bands Bottomdawg and The V-Town Have-Nots \, and also played drums in Diabolical Exploits with veteran punk-rock producer Andy Ernst\, who has produced such notable bands as Green Day\, Rancid\, and AFI.  The name 'Batching It' is short for 'batcheloring it'\, or 'going it alone'\, which perfectly describes the philosophy behind the project. After many years of not being in a band\, Rob's nostalgia kicked in and he decided that it was time to make a cover album of influential bands/songs\, songs and bands that inspired him to become a musician in his teenage years. The first Batching It project\, due out in the Fall of 2009 on Leficit Records\, is called 'Homage' - a self-explanatory title. Rob wanted to pay tribute to these bands and songs by reintroducing them to the new generation\, and covered in Rob's personal favorite styles.  Recorded at the legendary Art of Ears studio in Hayward\, CA by Andy Ernst\, and produced by Mike Lawson of Leficit Records\, 'Homage' is a 15-track nod to\, in Rob's opinion\, 15 awesome bands: NOFX\, Skankin' Pickle\, Swingin' Utters\, Pearl Jam\, Rancid\, Lagwagon\, Metallica\, Sublime\, No Use For a Name\, Smashing Pumpkins\, Weezer\, No Doubt\, The Descendents\, Less Than Jake\, and Operation Ivy. Crossing rock genres\, just like Rob's personal tastes\, 'Homage' should have something for everyone.	1

COL title VAL The Big Hurt COL performer VAL Scott Walker	COL video title VAL Lorez Alexandria -- Better Luck Next Time (1959) COL channel name VAL JazzyRNA COL description VAL Continuing with saga of America's most gifted\, and underrated jazz vocalists—this particular artist takes the cake—not meaning the particular term in a negative connotation\, but it's such a pity that a remarkable songstress—the incomparable\, Lorez Alexandria is not afforded the recognition that she so deserves. This is proven true\, given the fact that I recently discovered her albums—and I just haven't had my fill. I've searched and purchased everything I could find from such a gifted songstress. Lorez crafts each lyric with such grace and tonality that could easily match (if not surpass) the reigning jazz stylists of the bop/jazz/pop age. She gives each standard a new sense of evocative meaning as far as lyrics are concerned\, and reinvents the wheel each time she unleashes her enthralling voice. As she once said "A lyric is dead\, until you breathe life into it." This is exactly what she does. Enjoy and listen in HD\, to the lovely—Lorez Alexandria. All right(s) to 1959 King Records\, Inc.	0

Other members included Adrian Rollini (bass sax and xylophone)\, Fud Livingston and Bobby Davis (saxophones)\, and Chelsea Quealey.     During the 1920s the band was so in demand that they purchased a hotel on Pelham Parkway in the Bronx where they lived\, practiced\, and performed\, and dubbed it the Ramblers Inn. They went on to play some of the greatest clubs in New York City including the Rainbow Room at the top of the Rockefeller Center.     The original recordings made here were all “acoustical” 78s and interestingly\, recorded prior to the introduction of the microphone in 1925.     Although the music has been all but lost in our modern society\, it is my hope that these remastered jewels plucked from of our early American traditions will now live on into the 21st century and beyond.

Was the singer for several different bands in the 1920s\, including the Colonial Club Orchestra and The Regents Club Orchestra. He disappeared from public view in 1934 when he was laid off from work in the record industry as an executive and then genuinely disappeared for good\, because no one knows what happened to him after that. This was one of his biggest hits\, charting at #25 in 1930 for the year. Also a big(ger) hit for Nat Skrillet in the same year.  Photo is of the Regents Club Dance Hall In Brighton\, England. It was converted to a bingo hall in 1967 and then bulldozed in 1974\, a victim of changing taste in dance music.  50 hits on 9/26/11 100 hits on 11/10/11 250 hits on 3/16/12 500 htis on 9/6/12	0

COL title VAL Ain't No Way COL performer VAL Cheryl "Pepsii" Riley	COL video title VAL Nancy Sinatra & Lee Hazlewood: Some Velvet Morning COL channel name VAL calicomoonchild COL description VAL The second song I ever really loved.   I have loved & lived with this song all my life and it is one of my favourite top 10 tracks of all time.   Track Meaning:  One day when the male character in the song is sober and has his head "straight"\, he will impart something of significance to his current love about his earliest & deepest love\, a woman named "pheadra" whose memory he is still haunted by.  Hence the repetition of the Pheadra/ Nancy portion of the song . . .  her section symbolising the "haunting" and struggle inside his head as he tries to gain "closure" from this past relationship with a mysterious former love Pheadra . . . his part of the song being directed to his new lover in the present.    His present lack of sobriety (drunkeness) describing his vain attempts to drown out the all consuming memory of this mysterious former love\, a memory that he is aware is annoying his present lover and describes his fear that she may leave him as a result of his "haunting" by his old (first)love.  Note:  At the point in history this song was written the labels of "straight" (meaning hetrosexual) and "gay" (meaning homosexual) did not yet exist.  In fact by the late sixties the term "gay" was just another word for "happy".	0

So walk me back home\, my darling\, Tell me dreams really come true. Whistling\, whistling\, Here in the dark with you. So walk me back home\, my darling\, Tell me dreams really come true.

COL title VAL The Son of Hickory Holler's Tramp COL performer VAL Merle Haggard and The Strangers	COL video title VAL Simon & Garfunkel - The Only Living Boy In New York COL channel name VAL kylecrazyford COL description VAL "The Only Living Boy in New York" is a song written by Paul Simon and performed by Simon and Garfunkel. It is the eighth track from the American pop duo's fifth and final studio album\, Bridge Over Troubled Water. The song was also issued as the B-Side to the duo's "Cecilia" single.  Simon wrote this as a thinly-veiled message to Art Garfunkel\, referring to a specific incident where Garfunkel went to Mexico to act in the film Catch-22. Simon was left alone in New York writing songs for Bridge over Troubled Water\, hence the lonely feelings of "The Only Living Boy In New York." Simon refers to Garfunkel in the song as Tom\, referring to their early days when they were called Tom and Jerry\, and encourages him to "let your honesty shine...like it shines on me". The background vocals feature both Garfunkel and Simon recorded together in an echo chamber\, multi-tracked around eight times.	0

COL title VAL I Don't Care (Just As Long As You Love Me) COL performer VAL John Fogerty	COL video title VAL 1913 Massacre Ramblin' Jack Elliott COL channel name VAL leanannsidhe COL description VAL 1913 Massacre American Folk Tales Ramblin' Jack Elliot  The 1913 Massacre is based on an event that took place just as the song says in Calumet\, Michigan on December 24\, 1913. It is always known as the Italian Hall Disaster. The strike that led up to this was one of the longest\, most dangerous strikes that took place in Michigan. The song refers to copper country which is the upper peninsula of Michigan.  The miners were striking for better pay\, shortened work days and safer working conditions. Worker's pay was based on the depth of penetration into the mines made by his group that day. The mine was switching to using a one man drill\, the mechanical drill cutting cost for the mines. However it broke up the family groups that worked in the mines together and cut many jobs. Most workers made around $2.75 a day for 10 - 12 hours a day.   The strike had been going on for 5 months. The striking miners and their families had gathered at the Italian Hall for a Christmas party. It is thought that there were five hundred people at the party. The building had a steep staircase and the party was being held on the second floor. There was a fire escape\, however as was common at the time\, it was poorly marked\, poorly lit\, and could only be reached by climbing through the window. Someone yelled "fire" and in the panic that followed 73 people were killed. Over half of the people killed were children between the ages of six and ten.  The investigations that followed produced no culprit. Part of the problem was victims who did not speak English were questioned and forced to answer in English. In other cases witnesses were not questioned at all. It was and still is commonly thought that out of town strike breakers\, funded by mine management\, were the ones that yelled fire.  The Italian Hall has since been demolished\, and only the archway remains from that day. A state historical markers marks the spot and date.	0

COL title VAL Talk to Me Baby COL performer VAL Johnny Mercer	COL video title VAL Denny Reed - I'm Comin' Home COL channel name VAL TopshelfTom COL description VAL Man what a killer record this is. This was Denny's 3rd release\, from 1961\, on the United Artists label (after two singles for Trey\, including A Teenager Feels It Too\, which was first issued by MCI Records). Denny was close to signing with Columbia records when he decided to sign with United Artists instead\, which in the long run seems like that may have been a mistake on his part. However\, without signing to United Artists\, this single wouldn't have happened. The guitarist on this session is the legendary Al Caiola\, who was signed to United Artists as well\, which is how he came to be a part of the session\, I guess...and they cut this single in just two takes. This single was written by Charlie Rich and was also cut by Elvis Presely. This recording makes the song sound an awful lot like Carl Mann's version of Mona Lisa\, if you ask me.

COL title VAL Drop down Mama COL performer VAL Tom Rush	COL video title VAL Bill Keith Homestead on The Farm COL channel name VAL Marcus Brazil COL description VAL William Bradford Keith was born in Boston\, Massachusetts. He attended Amherst College and graduated in 1961. In 1963 he became a member of Bill Monroe's Bluegrass Boys.   Keith's recordings and performances during these nine months with Monroe permanently altered banjo playing\, and his style has become an important part of the playing styles of many banjoists. After leaving the Bluegrass Boys\, he joined "Jim Kweskin Jug Band" playing plectrum banjo. He began playing the steel guitar and soon after 1968\, found himself working together with Ian and Sylvia and Jonathan Edwards. In the 1970s Keith recorded for Rounder Records. Over the years he has performed with several other musicians\, such as Clarence White and David Grisman in Muleskinner\, Tony Trischka\, Jim Rooney and Jim Collier. Today\, Keith style is still regarded as modern or progressive in the context of bluegrass banjo playing.    Keith made a mechanical contribution to the banjo\, as well. He designed a specialized type of banjo tuning peg that facilitates changing quickly from one open tuning to another\, while playing. Earlier famed banjoist Earl Scruggs had designed a set of cams which were added to the banjo to perform this task. Keith's invention made the extra hardware unnecessary\, replacing two of the tuning machines already on the banjo — a more elegant solution.

COL title VAL Run Like Hell COL performer VAL Crippled Black Phoenix	COL video title VAL Eiffel 65 - Blue (Da Ba Dee) COL channel name VAL malawolf85 COL description VAL Eiffel 65 is a three man (Gianfranco Randone\, Maurizio Lobina\, and Gabriele Ponte) Italian eurodance group. Best know for their international hit "Blue (Da Ba Dee)" Eiffel 65's debut album "Europop" sold over two million units in the US\, making them the best selling Italian eurodance group ever in the United States. The origin of the group's name is an interesting sequence of chance. The name "Eiffel" was chosen randomly by a computer program and the "65" was scribbled onto their name on a demo by mistake; it was actually part of a phone number. The group Eiffel 65 is also known for their many remixes of songs from other artists\, with over thirty of them to their name. In 2005 Gabriele Ponte left the group to focus on his solo career and in 2006 the reminding members left the Bliss Corporation to form their own duo called Bloom 06. The Bliss Corporation\, who owns the name Eiffel 65\, had announced a new line up for the group would be debuting in the summer of 2007 however the debut was postponed until further notice.	0

The track was a no. 1 hit in the UK Singles Chart for three weeks in May 1979\, but despite this was not released as a single in the United States.  Song information  The song was written by Chris Stein and was the fourth single to be taken from the album\, Parallel Lines\, in the UK and most other parts of the world. The single had an unusual release in Australia\, with some dispute among fans as to whether it reached no. 1 there or failed to chart. This is because of its initial release as the lead single from Parallel Lines\, due to its being reminiscent of "In The Flesh"\, Blondie's first hit in Australia. "Sunday Girl" failed to chart\, however\, and was later re-released as a double A-side with "Heart of Glass"\, on the back of its UK success. As a result\, it was eclipsed by the disco track\, and is rarely recognised as having charted in its own right.  A French-language version of the track was released in the UK on the "Sunday Girl" 12" single; in France and the Netherlands\, it was the B-side of the 7". It also appears on the cassette release of Eat to the Beat. For Blondie's first greatest hits album The Best of Blondie in 1981\, producer Mike Chapman created a special mix which incorporated one verse sung in French. The bilingual version appears on the 2002 compilation Greatest Hits.  In 2010 a remake of this song was made by the English performer Florrie. It had slightly different lyrics and was used for a Nina Ricci perfume commercial. The song was covered in 2013 by the band She & Him on the album Volume 3.  In 2013 Blondie themselves re-recorded the song and offered it to be included in the CBGB's film soundtrack. This version was included on their 2014 compilation album Greatest Hits Deluxe Redux. The compilation was part of a 2-disc set called Blondie 4(0) Ever which included their 10th studio album Ghosts of Download and marked the 40th anniversary of the forming of the band.

Thomas\, Bill Medley\, Chuck Leavell and Judith Hill  Ever since his glorious surprise version of “The Way You Look Tonight” in the 1991 film “Father of The Bride” paved the way for his extraordinary second career as a GRAMMY Award winning vocalist/producer\, Steve Tyrell has been setting A New Standard (the title of his 1999 debut album) for interpreting the Great American Songbook – most notably on Songs of Sinatra (which reached #5 on the Billboard Jazz Albums chart) and his most recent Concord Records release\, It’s Magic: The Songs of Sammy Cahn (#2). On his 11th album\, That Lovin’ Feeling\, he celebrates what he calls “the Great American Songbook 2; the next generation of the Songbook\,” recording seminal rock era classics penned by legendary songwriters (many renowned for hits penned at New York’s famed Brill Building) who are also cherished longtime friends.   While sharing the enduring magic of timeless songs by the songwriting teams of Carole King and Gerry Goffin\, Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller\, Barry Mann & Cynthia Weil and Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich as well as Burt Bacharach\, Neil Sedaka\, Toni Wine and Carole Bayer Sager\, That Lovin’ Feeling sets itself apart from most tribute recordings with spirited guest vocal appearances by Mann\, B.J. Thomas\, Neil Sedaka and Bill Medley in addition to renowned backup singer Judith Hill (featured in the Oscar winning documentary “20 Feet From Stardom”) and Tyrell’s daughter Lauryn Tyrell. The set also includes key instrumental contributions by Stoller\, keyboardist Chuck Leavell\, saxophonist Dave Koz and even playful hand claps by Jeff Barry.	0

Mae'r term 'hen ferchetan' yn golygu dynes sydd heb briodi. Traditional Welsh folk song. The term 'hen ferchetan' means a woman who has never married.  The translation 'old maid' doesn't mean that the maid in question is actually old of age :-)  Geiriau: Hen ferchetan wedi colli'i chariad\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. Cael un arall\, dyna oedd ei bwriad\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Ond nid oedd un o lancie'r pentre\, ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, am briodi Lisa fach yr Hendre\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Hen ferchetan sydd yn dal i drio\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. Gwisgo lase sidan ac ymbincio\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Ond os oes brân i frân yn rhywle\, ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, nid oes neb i Lisa fach yr Hendre\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Hen ferchetan bron â thorri'i chalon\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. Mynd i'r llan mae pawb o'r hen gariadon\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Bydd tatws newydd ar bren 'fale\, ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, cyn briodith Lisa fach yr Hendre\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Hen ferchetan aeth i Ffair y Bala\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. Gweld Siôn Prys yn fachgen digon smala\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Gair a ddywedodd wrth fynd adre'\, ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, gododd calon Lisa fach yr Hendre\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Gododd calon Lisa fach yr Hendre\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  English Translation Lyrics: An old maid lost her lover\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. To get another\, that was her intention\,  ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  But none of the village boys\,  ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, wanted to marry Lisa fach yr Hendre\,  ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  An old maid keeps on trying\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. Wore satin lace and make up\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  But if there's someone for everyone somewhere\, ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, there is no one for Lisa fach yr Hendre\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  The old maid's heart is almost broken\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. All of her old lovers have married\,  ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  There'll be new potatoes on apple trees\, ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, before Lisa fach yr Hendre will marry\,  ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  The old maid went to Fair in Bala\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. Saw Siôn Prys an attractive lad\,  ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  A word he spoke as he went home\, ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, lifted Lisa fach yr Hendre's heavy heart \, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Lifted Lisa fach yr Hendre's heavy heart \, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.	0

Which is why Elektric Music had such a strong Kraftwerk flavour\, but with a lighter\, poppier touch. This track in particular is a rather silly\, frivolous take on Eddy Grant's hit.	0

El álbum fue grabado con bajo presupuesto y es casi inconseguible\, pero hay unos LPs a las vueltas y un gran disco para todos... Recomiendo explorar "Snow Queen"\, "I wasn't born to follow" y la canción que da nombre al álbum\, así como los demás trabajos de King\, como "Tapestry" y "Rhymes and Reasons".	1

Squee~  I love this song so so so so so so so so much. And very few people seem to know about it\, so I thought I'd make this.  If the lyrics sound familiar\, it's because this is actually a partial cover (?) to Head Like A Hole by Nine Inch Nails. The melody is different.  I modified the lyrics for this video from http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/2508/ and the beautiful picture is from http://snakeplaya24.deviantart.com/art/space-67540954. The font used is Little Sparrow. Hope you enjoy this! ♥  P.S. Forgot to mention\, this video is heavily inspired by Platypiz/ Platypizz/ Platypiz1/ Platypiz2/ any other incarnations this person may have.

COL title VAL Black Sabbath COL performer VAL Thou	COL video title VAL Ruth Brown - Never Let Me Go COL channel name VAL sanny blues COL description VAL A Good Day For The Blues ....Ruth Brown (1928-2006) was a rhythm & blues singer-songwriter\, record producer\, composer and actress noted for bringing a pop music style to rhythm & blues music. Backed by a bevy of New Orleans jazz and soul vets\, Brown delivers a series of horn-inflected\, indigo ballads like "Never Let Me Go\," "True\," and "The Richest One" that unearth the blues with an unruffled dignity reminiscent of Nina Simone or a less fragile Billie Holiday. On most of the rest of the material\, Brown invokes her Broadway experience to become the archetypal blues mama who "don't take no mess." In that vein\, "H.B.'s Funky Fable" is a humorous talk-sung tale for kids of all ages\, and "Cabbage Head" resurrects the minstrel-vaudeville days of Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith with hilarious aplomb\, as Brown nails the bawdy vernacular and trumpeter Abram Wilson spools out brassy asides that evoke the period perfectly.	0

COL title VAL Backstabbers COL performer VAL Lyn Collins	COL video title VAL Damita Jo - He Loves Me COL channel name VAL Scott Lilly COL description VAL Damita Jo DeBlanc (5 August 1930 -- 25 December 1998)\,[1] a.k.a. Damita Jo\, was an American actress\, comedian\, and lounge music performer. DeBlanc was born in Austin\, Texas\,[2] the featured vocalist on recordings from Steve Gibson and the Red Caps during the 1950s.[3] She later went on to marry Gibson\, but they parted ways professionally and personally in 1959.   Credited as simply Damita Jo\, DeBlanc had some chart success in the early 1960s with two answer songs: 1960's "I'll Save the Last Dance for You" (an answer to "Save the Last Dance for Me") and 1961's "I'll Be There" (an answer to "Stand By Me"). Both songs were originally sung by Ben E. King and made the R&B top 20\, and "I'll Be There" also reached number 12 on the pop chart. In 1962 she recorded "Dance With a Dolly (With a Hole in her Stocking"\, previously made famous by The Andrews Sisters and Bill Haley\, for Mercury Records. In 1966 she had a minor hit with a cover of the Jacques Brel song "If You Go Away."   She worked with Ray Charles\, Count Basie\, and Lionel Hampton. And\, in 1963\, she released a recording for Mercury Records with Billy Eckstine and Bobby Tucker Orchestra.   Damita Jo was later involved in comedy and toured with Redd Foxx. In 1998\, she suffered a respiratory illness and died on Christmas Day[2] in Baltimore\, Maryland.	0

COL title VAL Blue (Da Ba Dee) COL performer VAL Jonathan Young feat. ToxicxEternity & Travis Carte	COL video title VAL Eiffel 65 - Blue (Da Ba Dee) COL channel name VAL malawolf85 COL description VAL Eiffel 65 is a three man (Gianfranco Randone\, Maurizio Lobina\, and Gabriele Ponte) Italian eurodance group. Best know for their international hit "Blue (Da Ba Dee)" Eiffel 65's debut album "Europop" sold over two million units in the US\, making them the best selling Italian eurodance group ever in the United States. The origin of the group's name is an interesting sequence of chance. The name "Eiffel" was chosen randomly by a computer program and the "65" was scribbled onto their name on a demo by mistake; it was actually part of a phone number. The group Eiffel 65 is also known for their many remixes of songs from other artists\, with over thirty of them to their name. In 2005 Gabriele Ponte left the group to focus on his solo career and in 2006 the reminding members left the Bliss Corporation to form their own duo called Bloom 06. The Bliss Corporation\, who owns the name Eiffel 65\, had announced a new line up for the group would be debuting in the summer of 2007 however the debut was postponed until further notice.	1

COL title VAL Mister Magic COL performer VAL Kellee Patterson	COL video title VAL YVONNE ELLIMAN Hello Stranger COL channel name VAL daveinprogress3 COL description VAL Hawaiian beauty\, Yvonne Elliman\, was not on the pop landscape all that long\, but she made her impact\, and her gorgeous face and sweet but powerful vocals graced the 1970's with a distinctive air. I am posting "Hello Stranger"\, as it is not one of her bigger chart successes\, but it does showcase her wonderful voice and it is a very seventies take on the 60's Barbara Lewis classic.  35 years ago\, "Love me"\, written by the Bee Gees\, was a breakout hit for Yvonne\, giving her a worldwide hit\, including Australia\, where it would ascend the charts and reach #4 in the late summer of 1977. "Hello Stranger" was discovered by me\, once again courtesy of a Various Artist compile - the sexy styled "Ripper 77" with the curvaceous cheeks of a woman adorned with lipstick writing of the names of the 20 original artists featured on the record.  "Hello Stranger"\, like several of the hits on this compile\, was not a hit in Australia\, but three and a half decades later\, it is a fondly considered musical postcard from the era\, and i am eternally grateful to the record companies for releasing those compilations\, even if some of the inclusions were bizarre and obscure.  Back in the halcyon days of the late 1970's\, radio airplay and tv shows like "Countdown" and "Sounds Unlimited" were the few outlets for songs to receive exposure. So many fine recordings were simply overlooked\, because of the few opportunities for visibility or audibility at the time.   1978 would be the major year for Yvonne with another Gibb brothers extravaganza giving her the biggest success of her career with the #1 smash "If I can't have you"\, from  the pop & disco juggernaut "Saturday Night Fever". Another movie soundtrack "Moment by Moment" also starring John Travolta\, would see another recording by Yvonne Elliman - the title track\, but the gentle ballad could not break through the endless litany of disco hits that monopolised 1979. Her own "Love Pains" was her final hit from that part of her career\, and it is a much loved and much covered anthem from the disco era.  I hope "Hello Stranger" gives whoever hears it\, the joy that it has given me.	0

In retrospect\, it would have appeared that the Souls  may have been a decade ahead of time\, b'cos head today\, Live On sounds amazingly current with it's mix of roots\, funk\, soul\, jazz and pop \, and while it is true that it might be the least Jamaicans sounding of their albums\, with pedigree of crack island session players like Sly & Robbie\, Dwight Pinkney\, Sticky Thompson and Earl Lindo all over the tracks..."	0

At the dawn of the new millennium\, songwriter\, producer\, and multi- instrumentalist Klayton created Celldweller\, a ground-breaking aural entity for the next age. Thriving on originality\, Celldweller cross-bred electronic styles such as Drum'n'Bass and Psy-Trance with modern Alternative Rock and Metal on his self-titled debut\, released independently in 2003.  The Celldweller album met with critical acclaim while climbing to #17 on the Billboard Internet Sales Chart. Celldweller gained Top 40 Metal Radio charting with the track "I Believe You" pulling into a solid 11th place on the R&R Alternative Specialty Show Chart. Achieving a feat shared by only an elite handful of albums\, every song on Celldweller was eventually licensed for use in popular media. These songs were heard in movie trailers\, TV shows\, and games such as Spider Man 2\, Constantine\, Crackdown\, Need for Speed: Most Wanted\, Enter the Matrix\, CSI\, UFC\, The Shield\, and more.  Now\, Celldweller has been reissued to celebrate the tenth anniversary of its release with updated artwork and a second disc of remixes\, demos\, and previously unheard rarities (all remastered for this release). While Klayton busies himself in his Detroit studio preparing the future of Celldweller for 2013\, celebrate the past with this monumental work.  Want to use FiXT music in your YouTube videos?

Nur ein Spiel war fuer mich die Welt. Ueberall hatt' ich Freunde und doch war ich so allein.  Dann kamst Du und mit Dir kam die Liebe\, eine Liebe fuer's ganze Leben. Nie zuvor wollt' ich glauben\, dass es sowas je fuer mich gibt. Dann kamst Du; und dann hab' ich fuer immer\, Dir fuer immer mein Herz gegeben. Nun weiss ich\, dass das Leben erst schoen ist\, wirklich schoen ist\, wenn man sich liebt.  Frage nicht nach vergang'ner Zeit? Fast schon hab' ich vergessen\, wie es war\, bevor ich Dich gekannt. Ohne Ziel lebte ich dahin\, meinte wohl\, ich waer gluecklich\, weil ich nichts vom Glueck verstand.  Dann kamst Du und mit Dir kam die Liebe\, eine Liebe fuer's ganze Leben. Nie zuvor wollt' ich glauben\, dass es sowas je fuer mich gibt. Dann kamst Du; und dann hab' ich fuer immer\, Dir fuer immer mein Herz gegeben. Nun weiss ich\, dass das Leben erst schoen ist\, wirklich schoen ist\, wenn man sich liebt.	1

COL title VAL Půl párku COL performer VAL Jiří Suchý	COL video title VAL Open the Door\, Richard (#1 hit version) - The Three Flames COL channel name VAL geofbrit59 COL description VAL Another version of "Open the Door Richard" by the Three Flames. A very popular late 1940's vocal group. They hosted their own TV show on NBC in 1949. One of only two #1 versions of "Open the Door Richard" it charted Feb. 1947. I'm adding this to clear up some misinformation about this song....  Clinton "Dusty" Fletcher was an African-American vaudeville performer. He created the "Open The Door Richard" routine. It was Jack McVea who put the routine to music and recorded it. It became a huge hit in the late 1940s and was covered by many different bands. Dusty Fletcher even released his own two sided disc of it.	0

At the dawn of the new millennium\, songwriter\, producer\, and multi- instrumentalist Klayton created Celldweller\, a ground-breaking aural entity for the next age. Thriving on originality\, Celldweller cross-bred electronic styles such as Drum'n'Bass and Psy-Trance with modern Alternative Rock and Metal on his self-titled debut\, released independently in 2003.  The Celldweller album met with critical acclaim while climbing to #17 on the Billboard Internet Sales Chart. Celldweller gained Top 40 Metal Radio charting with the track "I Believe You" pulling into a solid 11th place on the R&R Alternative Specialty Show Chart. Achieving a feat shared by only an elite handful of albums\, every song on Celldweller was eventually licensed for use in popular media. These songs were heard in movie trailers\, TV shows\, and games such as Spider Man 2\, Constantine\, Crackdown\, Need for Speed: Most Wanted\, Enter the Matrix\, CSI\, UFC\, The Shield\, and more.  Now\, Celldweller has been reissued to celebrate the tenth anniversary of its release with updated artwork and a second disc of remixes\, demos\, and previously unheard rarities (all remastered for this release). While Klayton busies himself in his Detroit studio preparing the future of Celldweller for 2013\, celebrate the past with this monumental work.  Want to use FiXT music in your YouTube videos?

COL title VAL Let's Talk About Us COL performer VAL Billy Riley	COL video title VAL Bill Keith Homestead on The Farm COL channel name VAL Marcus Brazil COL description VAL William Bradford Keith was born in Boston\, Massachusetts. He attended Amherst College and graduated in 1961. In 1963 he became a member of Bill Monroe's Bluegrass Boys.   Keith's recordings and performances during these nine months with Monroe permanently altered banjo playing\, and his style has become an important part of the playing styles of many banjoists. After leaving the Bluegrass Boys\, he joined "Jim Kweskin Jug Band" playing plectrum banjo. He began playing the steel guitar and soon after 1968\, found himself working together with Ian and Sylvia and Jonathan Edwards. In the 1970s Keith recorded for Rounder Records. Over the years he has performed with several other musicians\, such as Clarence White and David Grisman in Muleskinner\, Tony Trischka\, Jim Rooney and Jim Collier. Today\, Keith style is still regarded as modern or progressive in the context of bluegrass banjo playing.    Keith made a mechanical contribution to the banjo\, as well. He designed a specialized type of banjo tuning peg that facilitates changing quickly from one open tuning to another\, while playing. Earlier famed banjoist Earl Scruggs had designed a set of cams which were added to the banjo to perform this task. Keith's invention made the extra hardware unnecessary\, replacing two of the tuning machines already on the banjo — a more elegant solution. Scruggs himself became a partner in the venture for a while\, and the product was known as "Scruggs-Keith Pegs". Known today simply as Keith Pegs\, they remain the state of the art\, and Bill Keith continues to manufacture and market them personally as the primary product of his own company\, the Beacon Banjo Company.	0

Damita Jo\, was an American actress\, comedian\, and lounge music performer. DeBlanc was born in Austin\, Texas\,[2] the featured vocalist on recordings from Steve Gibson and the Red Caps during the 1950s.[3] She later went on to marry Gibson\, but they parted ways professionally and personally in 1959.  Credited as simply Damita Jo\, DeBlanc had some chart success in the early 1960s with two answer songs: 1960's "I'll Save the Last Dance for You" (an answer to "Save the Last Dance for Me") and 1961's "I'll Be There" (an answer to "Stand By Me"). Both songs were originally sung by Ben E. King and made the R&B top 20\, and "I'll Be There" also reached number 12 on the pop chart. In 1962 she recorded "Dance With a Dolly (With a Hole in her Stocking)"\, previously made famous by The Andrews Sisters and Bill Haley\, for Mercury Records. In 1966 she had a minor hit with a cover of the Jacques Brel song "If You Go Away."  She worked with Ray Charles\, Count Basie\, and Lionel Hampton. And\, in 1963\, she released a recording for Mercury Records with Billy Eckstine and Bobby Tucker Orchestra.  Damita Jo was later involved in comedy and toured with Redd Foxx. In 1998\, she suffered a respiratory illness and died on Christmas Day[2] in Baltimore\, Maryland.	1

COL title VAL Dear God COL performer VAL Friend Slash Lover	COL video title VAL ELIO PACE - I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues (from the album 'Come And Get It' 2002) 8of 16 COL channel name VAL rosarecordsonline COL description VAL 'I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues' was written by Elton John\, Bernie Taupin and Davey Johnstone and was originally recorded by Elton John.  _________________________  A message from Elio...  The original concept behind 'Come And Get It'\, was to produce a high quality demo for me and my band to use as promotion with a view to attracting bigger and better corporate work as a 'covers band'. It was never intended for commercial release. Proving this point\, the original two-thousand CDs pressed in February 2002\, had no barcode on the artwork.  In fact\, the idea (going into the first day of recording) was to record only segments of 10 or 12 songs and to create a five-minute showreel. It was only just as recording was about to commence that Darren Loveday (one of two guitarists in the band at the time and my co-producer on the project) suggested that for the time it took to decide which segment of each song should be recorded\, we may as well play the whole song from start to finish\, especially as we all knew the songs so well\, having played them so many times. It was only when listening back the following day to the 13-tracks we'd recorded\, that Darren and I decided to create a full album of the material.  It was also decided that along with the 13 'new' songs\, we should make use of the 74-minutes available on CD (at the time) and include; a previous demo we'd made in 1998 of Billy Joel's 'My Life'; a live stereo recording (off MiniDisc\, with a few overdubs) of Jerry Lee Lewis' 'Great Balls Of Fire' from August 2000; and demos of three original songs I'd written (Addicted To The Phone\, Got The Bug Back and Katy Likes House) which would eventually be re-recorded and released on my 2009 'debut' album\, 'A Seat At My Table.  The last item that we decided to include on this original 19-track album was a 1998 demo we had recorded of Delbert McClinton's 'Two More Bottles Of Wine'. Ironically\, it was THIS little track (with just myself on piano\, Darren on guitar and the both of us doing the backing vocals and hand-claps) that realised the original concept for this album and opened a huge door for me in my career. Sir Terry Wogan and the late Paul Walters\, working together on BBC Radio 2's 'Wake Up To Wogan'\, played my version of 'Two More Bottles Of Wine' on their show\, once a week for six-months\, from August 2003. It was the first time that one of my recordings had been played on national radio in the UK. I really wasn't prepared for it as I didn't even have a website at the time.  I eventually got my act together and although casually stocked in a hand-full of small record shops\, 'Come And Get It' (on my own label\, Rosa Records) became available to buy in 2005 on CD via my website and then released to the general public as a download in 2007. This digital release and the subsequent CD pressings does not include the three demos of my songs... for obvious reasons. Now discontinued\, you would have to hunt down one of the original batch of those two-thousand CDs pressed in February 2002.  By the way\, the billing as 'The Elio Pace Band' was purely to guarantee that prospective clients knew that they were not booking just an individual at a piano and to differentiate between my two 'hats' as a performer; a) playing 'dance party' covers and b) playing my own material\, for which I would simply be known as Elio Pace. Interestingly\, Terry Wogan never once announced my record as 'The Elio Pace Band'. Instead he always referred to me as "Elio Pace and his band". 'Come And Get It' was the first and only album that will have 'The Elio Pace Band' as the artist name although I fully expect to record another album of covers sometime in the future.  _________________________  Track listing:  1.

Når dronningen av Saba gjør Salomo visitt\, je ser a "Lea Lettvint" og hu har tenkt seg hit. Om leiet blir forskjellig frå silkeseng tel strå\, vi går mot såmmå paradis og hører harper slå.  Refr.  Når sola synk og dale bak slottets tårn og tind\, så kjæm den mørke natta med drøm og tankespinn\, der blir je sjøl Kong Salomo og hæin blir kænskje den som står og svarver hatter uti hattemakergrenn.

COL title VAL Oon sun mies COL performer VAL Matti Esko	COL video title VAL YVONNE ELLIMAN Hello Stranger COL channel name VAL daveinprogress3 COL description VAL Hawaiian beauty\, Yvonne Elliman\, was not on the pop landscape all that long\, but she made her impact\, and her gorgeous face and sweet but powerful vocals graced the 1970's with a distinctive air. I am posting "Hello Stranger"\, as it is not one of her bigger chart successes\, but it does showcase her wonderful voice and it is a very seventies take on the 60's Barbara Lewis classic.  35 years ago\, "Love me"\, written by the Bee Gees\, was a breakout hit for Yvonne\, giving her a worldwide hit\, including Australia\, where it would ascend the charts and reach #4 in the late summer of 1977. "Hello Stranger" was discovered by me\, once again courtesy of a Various Artist compile - the sexy styled "Ripper 77" with the curvaceous cheeks of a woman adorned with lipstick writing of the names of the 20 original artists featured on the record.  "Hello Stranger"\, like several of the hits on this compile\, was not a hit in Australia\, but three and a half decades later\, it is a fondly considered musical postcard from the era\, and i am eternally grateful to the record companies for releasing those compilations\, even if some of the inclusions were bizarre and obscure.  Back in the halcyon days of the late 1970's\, radio airplay and tv shows like "Countdown" and "Sounds Unlimited" were the few outlets for songs to receive exposure. So many fine recordings were simply overlooked\, because of the few opportunities for visibility or audibility at the time.   1978 would be the major year for Yvonne with another Gibb brothers extravaganza giving her the biggest success of her career with the #1 smash "If I can't have you"\, from  the pop & disco juggernaut "Saturday Night Fever". Another movie soundtrack "Moment by Moment" also starring John Travolta\, would see another recording by Yvonne Elliman - the title track\, but the gentle ballad could not break through the endless litany of disco hits that monopolised 1979. Her own "Love Pains" was her final hit from that part of her career\, and it is a much loved and much covered anthem from the disco era.  I hope "Hello Stranger" gives whoever hears it\, the joy that it has given me.	0

COL title VAL Walk on the Wild Side COL performer VAL Elmer Bernstein	COL video title VAL Michel Legrand Orchestra I Will Say Goodbye featuring - Sarah Vaughan COL channel name VAL ifcopod COL description VAL Adding  to U Tube's embarrassment of riches  a  Legrand song and  version  already posted. A good Jack Jones take   but then did Jones do otherwise than good interpretations  .. What can you say about Sarah Vaughan apart from " the best" The dispute is less active but thirty plus  years ago   you could  get a conversation about who is the greatest jazz singer  or even what is a jazz singer. it encouraged many into print  with aspirants spreading themselves on the   quidditas of singing.  Louis  Armstrong for whom some flew a flag as greatest jazz  singer. may I respectfully dissent. The  big  three  for  me and  seemingly many ~ . Operatic voiced Sarah   Vaughan ~Virtuoso  scat  singer  but also excellent straight ballad singer  Ella Fitzgerald ~and for those with a yen for tragedy Billie Holiday.  but many many more  ~  some not getting respect deserved.Some skirting jazz~  a Raincheck ~ In the 1960s or a little later  I had an album by a singer since died but underlining the cross border nature of music from show tunes   to jazz.  singer  Carol Ventura . Nowadays  a name  sadly  for a pub quiz  but Ventura was a skilled singer especially remembered Everybody says Dont (musical Anyone can Whistle) and another number Bye Bye Just checked U Tube and its not there  so  quite a deal  of music still missing from internet  but lets pay tribute to 87 year old veteran jazz arranger  saxist  Benny Golson who scored Ventura's albums a talent in the vicinity of Quincy Jones.  I have some live Golson visuals from 1965( at least i hope I still jhave from  a  BBC session   featuring Tubby Hayes in the saxes.   The great thing the  aforementioned  female trio   Vaughan Fitzgerald Holiday don t clash ~ each with unique  vocal   attributes  True  Ella and Sarah   have similarities both possessed of phenomenal  vocal virtuosity  and quite obviously rejoicing in their    special vocal gifts.  and  that white heat art creativity   led to   prolific  legacies  A time when skill in musical art was paramount  in performance. something that nosedived or perhaps simply changed  as the years passed   but that's another story . Unlike the greats of yore  todays  pop music  depends   less on  interpretative skills. Although her voice was ragged  by that   time ( comparatively speaking   but always musical ) Ella late in her career did a live Basie Album  that still swings like billy~o.Ella's  1950s   1960s  songbooks  with voice in full loom  are   a treasure of popular music.  I know rockers and latterday musos want to protect their music as special but  another prejudice? For me the best  popular music   of 20th  century     starts and ends with George Gershwin Harold Arlen Cole Porter Richard Rodgers  and  other  mid century  songwriters   with  songs  marked   by many things not least versatility  in interpretation not just in a jazz way..  An attractive understated I Will say Goodbye   on  U Tube  from 1972  but then Lena Horne  could   easily  do  linear  understated  interpretations  amidst her blitzing  up tempos numbers. The arrangement seems Legrand and better for it.  Pity   Everybody says Dont  is less heard nowadays Barbra Streisand also had her  say on that show tune . Not one to say boo about Streisand and her vocal technique  but I probably prefer Ventura on the song. Theres a lot of  vocal  exertion in the Streisand version ~ Ifcopod thats what the song is about a sort of patter song going like the clappers .Nonetheless~(  IIfcopods desperate bid for credibility  as the ship sinks) ~I prefer the   more deliberate gait of Ventura  version.  But if there is an implicit agenda  to this  erudite spiel Consider the numerous( literally) singers who  like Ventura  just  got one stab at success. Luckily we have the CDs or more likely vinyls.   This has nothing to do with anything just wanted to share the thought. In the 1970s I had a great live Buddy Greco album  recorded in the UK  doing among other things   youve guessed it  his party piece  Thats why Thats  why  the  Lady is a Tramp. the album~ vinyl disappeared but not memories  of Buddy  swinging like crazy  doing what he did so well. A great version.	0

Recorded in the early 1960s\, "Funnel of Love" was released as the B-side to Jackson's major country-pop single\, "Right or Wrong". Although the song never became a hit independently from the A-side\, it has received notable critical acclaim and attention. The song's unique combination of country\, rock\, and blues have made it a favorite of fans and critics. Many also consider "Funnel of Love" to be one of Jackson's best vocal performances.  Background  Charlie McCoy\, a country musician\, and Kent Westbury\, a country songwriter\, wrote the lyrics and melody to "Funnel of Love". The song came to the attention of Jackson while recording for Capitol Records in the early 1960s\, under the direction of producer Ken Nelson. Up to this point\, Jackson had been known as a country performer and more significantly as a rock and roll performer. She had previously enjoyed both country and rock hits\, including "You Can't Have My Love" (1954) and "Let's Have a Party" (1960). In an interview with Philadelphia Weekly\, Jackson recounted that it was difficult identifying "Funnel of Love" with a specific musical genre\, stating that its style was not like that of a typical country or rock recording: "It wasn't country\, it wasn't rock\, but we knew it was a good song. So we made a good record on it."  Regardless\, the song was well-received by both Jackson and Ken Nelson\, leading to the song's initial recording. "Funnel of Love" was recorded at the Bradley Film and Recording Studio in Nashville\, Tennessee\, United States on October 28\, 1960. The session was Jackson's third recording session in Nashville. Jackson and Nelson had been recording material in Hollywood\, California since the early 1950s. Also cut at the session was the eventual A-side to "Funnel of Love" entitled "Right or Wrong"\, as well as "Riot in Cell Black #9" and "Little Charm Bracelet". The latter was the precessing single to "Right or Wrong". Included in the recording session was The Nashville A-Team of musicians\, which appeared on most country recording sessions in the late 1950s and 1960s. The song's guitar solo is performed by Roy Clark\, who was a member of Jackson's band "The Party Timers" and would later have a successful country music career.  Release and reception  "Funnel of Love" was released as B-side of the "Right or Wrong" single in April 1961. The songs were released on Capitol Records. The A-side became Wanda Jackson's second top-ten hit on the Billboard Hot Country and Western Sides chart\, peaking at number nine. It also became her second top-forty single on the Billboard Hot 100\, reaching number twenty nine. "Funnel of Love" however\, failed to chart any Billboard lists.  "Funnel of Love" was never released via an album during Jackson's time at Capitol Records. The song went unreleased on an album until Bear Family Records released the Wanda Jackson box set Right or Wrong in 1992. "Funnel of Love" was then released onto various compilations during the 1990s and 2000s. The song has since received vast critical acclaim from multiple music critics. Adam Gold of Rolling Stone called Jackson's song a "greasy classic" and Tim Sendra of Allmusic explained that although "Funnel of Love" is not associated with the "girl group" sound of the sixties\, it "adds historical interest" and is "really quite good too". Chris Parker of Philadelphia Weekly stated that "Funnel of Love" was one of his favorite songs by Wanda Jackson.  With the renewal of interest in Jackson's career since the 1990s\, "Funnel of Love" has become a favorite of Wanda Jackson fans. Many were surprised that the B-side did not become more successful. It has since been covered by various musical artists. In 2001\, foreign music group Velvetone released a single version of "Funnel of Love"\, featuring Jackson herself. Jackson revisited "Funnel of Love" on her 2003 studio album\, Heart Trouble. The new version featured the punk rock band The Cramps as guest performers.  "Funnel of Love" has also served as an inspiration for new musical artists\, most notably British soul artist Adele.  The song is used at the opeing scene of the 2013 Jim Jarmusch's film ''Only Lovers Left Alive''. It is also included in the soundtrack of the movie.	0

The dust has only just begun to fall\, Crop circles in the carpet\, sinking\, feeling. Spin me 'round again and rub my eyes. This can't be happening. When busy streets amass with people Would stop to hold their heads heavy.  Hide and seek. Trains and sewing machines. All those years they were here first.  Oily marks appear on walls Where pleasure moments hung before. The takeover\, the sweeping insensitivity of this still life.  Hide and seek. Trains and sewing machines. (Oh\, you won't catch me around here) Blood and tears (hearts)\, They were here first.  Mmm\, what you say? Mm\, that you only meant well? Well\, of course you did. Mmm\, what you say? Mm\, that it's all for the best? Of course it is. Mmm\, what you say? Mm\, that it's just what we need? And you decided this. What you say? Mmm\, what did She say?  Ransom notes keep falling out your mouth. Mid-sweet talk\, newspaper word cut-outs. Speak no feeling\, no I don't believe you. You don't care a bit. You don't care a bit.  (hide and seek) Ransom notes keep falling out your mouth. Mid-sweet talk\, newspaper word cut-outs. (hide and seek) Speak no feeling\, no I don't believe you. You don't care a bit. You don't care a bit.  (hide and seek) You don't care a bit. You don't care a bit. You don't care a bit. (hide and seek) You don't care a bit. You don't care a bit.  #imogenheap #hideandseek #normalpeople #hulu #bbc #imogenheaphideandseek	1

I am going through the whole collection and putting all of them online.  I started this channel because posting all of this music on my main mining and carpentry channel was driving subscribers away.  Some of the stuff is kind of rare and a bunch of it will be the only copy on youtube.  In theory all of these records are for sale if you want them.  Message me in the comments.   All of the records are being played on Zenith 6R-668 tube type radio and record player.  When I picked it up from the leftovers pile at the estate it was not working.  While not a record player expert by any means\, I was able to get it operable.  The needle is rough but after carefully reshaping it on a diamond stone I got it to play much better.  So far no replacement needle can be located.  I found one that fit the holder but it was the newer style and didn't work with 78's.  You can get a look at the player by following this link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YCtwrOdGb8 We have no intention of fighting any content challenges; even the bogus ones and so will simply acknowledge and move on.  My only goal is to put it out there before it is gone.  In theory any of these records is for sale and you need but drop me a line in the comments.  I do intend to monetize but understand we are talking a predicted whole channel income of less than $5 a month.  Anything helps and this take a lot of times so please don't hate me for that. --Ken	0

They said you came this way  The eyes of the people who passed him by Were cold and hard as stone The poor boy whimpered and began to cry Because he was all alone  Brother\, where are you? They told me that you came this way Brother\, where are you? They said you came this way  Now there are many Who will swear that it's true That brothers are we all Yet it seems there are very few Who will answer a brother's call  Brother\, where are you?

His first recordings were in the Cool Jazz style and after his collaboration with Martin Denny he finally created his very own style \, excelling in moody  Vibraphone /Marimba dominated modern Hawaiian Jazz.. Adventures was originally composed by Lionel Newman \, a member of a great  composers dynasty . It was created as TV theme for the popular TV series \, wich is introduced in this video at the first 17 seconds .The first series ran from 1958 till 1961. Lyman recorded "Adventures " in 1961  on the Ryckodisc label.It was part of the  famous Yellow Bird album. Starring in this video are also some guest stars from the TV series back then. The eclectic sound of Lyman's music justifys a good audiosystem \, or the use of headphones.These records were produced by the sound engineer Richard Vaughn in the beginning day's of stereo recording \, and were quite inventive in those day's.

Belying its title—“ambsace” is the lowest throw of dice; snake eyes—the record thrives on a gentle empathy and generosity of spirit\, sitting sneakily protean original compositions alongside gorgeous arrangements of songs by Duke Ellington and The Smiths at the same big hand-hewn table.

COL title VAL Because COL performer VAL Lettermen	COL video title VAL ELIO PACE - I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues (from the album 'Come And Get It' 2002) 8of 16 COL channel name VAL rosarecordsonline COL description VAL 'I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues' was written by Elton John\, Bernie Taupin and Davey Johnstone and was originally recorded by Elton John.  _________________________  A message from Elio...  The original concept behind 'Come And Get It'\, was to produce a high quality demo for me and my band to use as promotion with a view to attracting bigger and better corporate work as a 'covers band'. It was never intended for commercial release. Proving this point\, the original two-thousand CDs pressed in February 2002\, had no barcode on the artwork.  In fact\, the idea (going into the first day of recording) was to record only segments of 10 or 12 songs and to create a five-minute showreel. It was only just as recording was about to commence that Darren Loveday (one of two guitarists in the band at the time and my co-producer on the project) suggested that for the time it took to decide which segment of each song should be recorded\, we may as well play the whole song from start to finish\, especially as we all knew the songs so well\, having played them so many times. It was only when listening back the following day to the 13-tracks we'd recorded\, that Darren and I decided to create a full album of the material.  It was also decided that along with the 13 'new' songs\, we should make use of the 74-minutes available on CD (at the time) and include; a previous demo we'd made in 1998 of Billy Joel's 'My Life'; a live stereo recording (off MiniDisc\, with a few overdubs) of Jerry Lee Lewis' 'Great Balls Of Fire' from August 2000; and demos of three original songs I'd written (Addicted To The Phone\, Got The Bug Back and Katy Likes House) which would eventually be re-recorded and released on my 2009 'debut' album\, 'A Seat At My Table.  The last item that we decided to include on this original 19-track album was a 1998 demo we had recorded of Delbert McClinton's 'Two More Bottles Of Wine'. Ironically\, it was THIS little track (with just myself on piano\, Darren on guitar and the both of us doing the backing vocals and hand-claps) that realised the original concept for this album and opened a huge door for me in my career. Sir Terry Wogan and the late Paul Walters\, working together on BBC Radio 2's 'Wake Up To Wogan'\, played my version of 'Two More Bottles Of Wine' on their show\, once a week for six-months\, from August 2003. It was the first time that one of my recordings had been played on national radio in the UK. I really wasn't prepared for it as I didn't even have a website at the time.  I eventually got my act together and although casually stocked in a hand-full of small record shops\, 'Come And Get It' (on my own label\, Rosa Records) became available to buy in 2005 on CD via my website and then released to the general public as a download in 2007. This digital release and the subsequent CD pressings does not include the three demos of my songs... for obvious reasons. Now discontinued\, you would have to hunt down one of the original batch of those two-thousand CDs pressed in February 2002.  By the way\, the billing as 'The Elio Pace Band' was purely to guarantee that prospective clients knew that they were not booking just an individual at a piano and to differentiate between my two 'hats' as a performer; a) playing 'dance party' covers and b) playing my own material\, for which I would simply be known as Elio Pace. Interestingly\, Terry Wogan never once announced my record as 'The Elio Pace Band'. Instead he always referred to me as "Elio Pace and his band". 'Come And Get It' was the first and only album that will have 'The Elio Pace Band' as the artist name although I fully expect to record another album of covers sometime in the future.  _________________________  Track listing:  1.

COL title VAL Ooh La La COL performer VAL Faces	COL video title VAL 1913 Massacre Ramblin' Jack Elliott COL channel name VAL leanannsidhe COL description VAL 1913 Massacre American Folk Tales Ramblin' Jack Elliot  The 1913 Massacre is based on an event that took place just as the song says in Calumet\, Michigan on December 24\, 1913. It is always known as the Italian Hall Disaster. The strike that led up to this was one of the longest\, most dangerous strikes that took place in Michigan. The song refers to copper country which is the upper peninsula of Michigan.  The miners were striking for better pay\, shortened work days and safer working conditions. Worker's pay was based on the depth of penetration into the mines made by his group that day. The mine was switching to using a one man drill\, the mechanical drill cutting cost for the mines. However it broke up the family groups that worked in the mines together and cut many jobs. Most workers made around $2.75 a day for 10 - 12 hours a day.   The strike had been going on for 5 months. The striking miners and their families had gathered at the Italian Hall for a Christmas party. It is thought that there were five hundred people at the party. The building had a steep staircase and the party was being held on the second floor. There was a fire escape\, however as was common at the time\, it was poorly marked\, poorly lit\, and could only be reached by climbing through the window. Someone yelled "fire" and in the panic that followed 73 people were killed. Over half of the people killed were children between the ages of six and ten.  The investigations that followed produced no culprit. Part of the problem was victims who did not speak English were questioned and forced to answer in English. In other cases witnesses were not questioned at all. It was and still is commonly thought that out of town strike breakers\, funded by mine management\, were the ones that yelled fire.  The Italian Hall has since been demolished\, and only the archway remains from that day. A state historical markers marks the spot and date.	0

The record is over 50 years old and has a high amount of surface noise. The extreme detail of the music can be heard\, despite the surface noise.  I've been working to reduce surface noise pickup and have exhausted all the techniques I know of to reduce that noise. That AT92ECD cartridge I use has a .3 X .7 mil stylus and my pre amp system makes no compromises in high frequency response or low noise performance\, so I would especially appreciate suggestions from anyone who may be able to hear and point me to it's cause. Thank you.  UPDATE: 1/14/2012 I've worked up a satisfactory deep-groove cleaning system. I'll be posting very clean records soon and plan to produce a video about my wacky method.

COL title VAL The Way I Walk COL performer VAL The Flametrick Subs	COL video title VAL TIME OUT FOR TEARS -Bill Lawrence COL channel name VAL montanarecordhunter COL description VAL Columbia 39029   I ended up with about 100 vintage old LP's and while they have little if any monetary or collector value given condition and storage issues yet I couldn't bear to get rid of them.  I am going through the whole collection and putting all of them online.  I started this channel because posting all of this music on my main mining and carpentry channel was driving subscribers away.  Some of the stuff is kind of rare and a bunch of it will be the only copy on youtube.  In theory all of these records are for sale if you want them.  Message me in the comments.   All of the records are being played on Zenith 6R-668 tube type radio and record player.  When I picked it up from the leftovers pile at the estate it was not working.  While not a record player expert by any means\, I was able to get it operable.  The needle is rough but after carefully reshaping it on a diamond stone I got it to play much better.  So far no replacement needle can be located.  I found one that fit the holder but it was the newer style and didn't work with 78's.  You can get a look at the player by following this link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YCtwrOdGb8 We have no intention of fighting any content challenges; even the bogus ones and so will simply acknowledge and move on.  My only goal is to put it out there before it is gone.  In theory any of these records is for sale and you need but drop me a line in the comments.  I do intend to monetize but understand we are talking a predicted whole channel income of less than $5 a month.  Anything helps and this take a lot of times so please don't hate me for that. --Ken	0

Juliet says hey it's romeo he nearly gave me a heart attack he's underneath the window she's singing hey la my boyfriend's back you shoudn't come around here singing up at people like that anyway what you gonna do about it?  Juliet the dice were loaded from the start and I bet and you exploded in my heart and I forget\, I forget the movie song when you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong juliet?  Come up on different streets they both were streets of shame both dirty both mean yes and the dream was just the same and I dream your dream for you and now your dream is real how can you look at me as I was just another one of your deals?  Well you can fall for chains of silver you can fall for chains of gold you can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold you promised me everything you promised me thick and thin now you just say oh romeo yeah you know I used to have a scene with him  Juliet when we made love you used to cry you said I love you like the stars above you said I'll love you till I die there's a place for us you know the movie song when you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong Juliet?  I can't do the talk like the talk on the tv and I can't do a love song like the way its meant to be I can't do everything but I'd do anything for you can't do anything except be in love with you  And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be all I do is keep the beat the bad company all I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme julie I'd do the stars with you any time  Juliet when we made love you used to cry you said I love you like the stars above you said Ill love you till I die there's a place for us you know the movie song when you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong Juliet?

It is always known as the Italian Hall Disaster. The strike that led up to this was one of the longest\, most dangerous strikes that took place in Michigan. The song refers to copper country which is the upper peninsula of Michigan.  The miners were striking for better pay\, shortened work days and safer working conditions. Worker's pay was based on the depth of penetration into the mines made by his group that day. The mine was switching to using a one man drill\, the mechanical drill cutting cost for the mines. However it broke up the family groups that worked in the mines together and cut many jobs. Most workers made around $2.75 a day for 10 - 12 hours a day.   The strike had been going on for 5 months. The striking miners and their families had gathered at the Italian Hall for a Christmas party. It is thought that there were five hundred people at the party. The building had a steep staircase and the party was being held on the second floor. There was a fire escape\, however as was common at the time\, it was poorly marked\, poorly lit\, and could only be reached by climbing through the window. Someone yelled "fire" and in the panic that followed 73 people were killed. Over half of the people killed were children between the ages of six and ten.  The investigations that followed produced no culprit. Part of the problem was victims who did not speak English were questioned and forced to answer in English. In other cases witnesses were not questioned at all. It was and still is commonly thought that out of town strike breakers\, funded by mine management\, were the ones that yelled fire.  The Italian Hall has since been demolished\, and only the archway remains from that day. A state historical markers marks the spot and date.	0

COL title VAL Dizzy Atmosphere COL performer VAL Dizzy Gillespie Sextet	COL video title VAL Hall & Oates - Everyday Will Be Like A Holiday COL channel name VAL thatMimosaGrove COL description VAL 4th track from "Home For Christmas" (2006). The grammarian in me wants to change the spelling from "Everyday" to "Every Day." But who cares\, right? All that really matters is that the biggest-selling duo in Yacht Rock history has made a Christmas album!  On this track\, Hall and Oates cover William Bell and Booker T. Jones' classic R&B tune\, retaining not only the original spelling of the title but the warm vibe as well. But while the original song doesn't actually mention Christmas by name\, in typical Daryl Hall fashion\, the lyrics have been altered slightly and now leave no doubt about the holiday in question. In addition\, the duo gives this song—like all the others on the album—a smooth\, slick veneer that's nevertheless earthy\, friendly\, and comforting.   "Every day will be like a holiday / When my baby\, when my baby comes home Here she comes / I think I see her right now..."  They've really got my believing it!   ~thatMimosaGrove  P.S. – I plan to upload\, if not all\, at least a few more songs from this excellent album (which\, btw\, is weighted on the side of the sacred and reverential—a definite plus in my book). I started with this particular song because I couldn't find the album version on YouTube.

Que j'me démène ou qu'je reste coi Je passe pour un je-ne-sais-quoi  Je ne fais pourtant de tort à  personne En suivant mon chemin de petit bonhomme. Mais les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Non les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Tout le monde médit de moi\, Sauf les muets\, ça va de soi.  Le jour du Quatorze Juillet Je reste dans mon lit douillet. La musique qui marche au pas\, Cela ne me regarde pas.  Je ne fais pourtant de tort à  personne\, En n'écoutant pas le clairon qui sonne. Mais les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Non les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Tout le monde me montre du doigt Sauf les manchots\, ça va de soi.  Quand j'croise un voleur malchanceux\, Poursuivi par un cul-terreux; J'lance la patte et pourquoi le taire\, Le cul-terreux s'retrouve par terre  Je ne fais pourtant de tort à  personne\, En laissant courir les voleurs de pommes. Mais les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Non les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Tout le monde se rue sur moi\, Sauf les culs-de-jatte\, ça va de soi.  Pas besoin d'être Jérémie\, Pour d'viner l'sort qui m'est promis\, S'ils trouvent une corde à  leur goût\, Ils me la passeront au cou\,  Je ne fais pourtant de tort à  personne\, En suivant les ch'mins qui n'mènent pas à  Rome\, Mais les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Non les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Tout l'mond' viendra me voir pendu\, Sauf les aveugles\, bien entendu.

The band was a pioneer in the early American new wave and punk rock scenes. Their first two albums contained strong elements of these genres\, and although successful in the United Kingdom and Australia\, Blondie was regarded as an underground band in the United States until the release of Parallel Lines in 1978. In Canada\, they were regarded as an underground band until the release of the subsequent album Eat to the Beat. Over the next three years\, the band achieved several hit singles and was noted for its eclectic mix of musical styles incorporating elements of disco\, pop and reggae\, while retaining a basic style as a new wave band.  The band broke up after the release of the 1982 album "The Hunter". Debbie Harry (although she took a few years off to care for her partner\, Chris Stein\, who had a life-threatening illness) became an extremely successful solo artist. Keyboardist Jimmy Destri also embarked on a solo career of his own with somewhat less success than Harry. [2]  The group reformed in 1997\, achieving renewed success and a number one single in the United Kingdom with "Maria" in 1999. The group toured and performed throughout the world over the following years\, and was inducted into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the RockWalk of Fame in 2006. ‌‌ Bohemia Afterdark is a channel for music lovers that remember the alternative\, grunge and hip hop  music from the late 80’s and early 90’s.

Some of his best-known songs are "Lean on Me"\, "Ain't No Sunshine"\, "Use Me"\, "Just the Two of Us"\, "Lovely Day"\, and "Grandma's Hands". His life was recently the subject of the documentary film Still Bill. Withers was born the youngest of thirteen children in the small coal-mining town of Slab Fork\, West Virginia. Raised in nearby Beckley\, West Virginia\, Withers was thirteen years old when his father died. He enlisted with the United States Navy at age eighteen and served for nine years\, during which time he became interested in singing and writing songs. Soon after his discharge from the Navy in 1970\, he relocated to Los Angeles for a musical career. Withers worked as an assembler for several different companies\, including Douglas Aircraft Corporation\, while recording demo tapes with his own money\, shopping them around and performing in clubs at night. When he debuted with the song "Ain't No Sunshine" he refused to resign his job because of his belief that the music business was a fickle industry and that he was still a novice compared to other acts.  Lyrics  A man we passed just tried to stare me down  And when I looked at you\, you looked at the ground  I don't know who he is but I think that you do   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   I have something in my heart and in your eyes  Tell me he's not someone just passin' by  And when you cleared your throat was that your cue   Dag gummit dag  Who is he and what is he to you   Now when I add the sum of you and me  I get confused and I keep coming up with three  You're too much for one man but not enough for two   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Hey you tell me man don't have not much for intuition  That what you really think or are you wishin'  Before you wreck your old home be certain of the new   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you	0

COL title VAL No Diggity COL performer VAL Beelzebubs	COL video title VAL ♥ "She Loves Me" - by Jack Jones COL channel name VAL 65Seasons COL description VAL Song: She Loves Me Singer: Jack Jones  "She Loves Me" is a musical with a book by Joe Masteroff\, lyrics by Sheldon Harnick\, and music by Jerry Bock.  The musical is the fifth adaptation of the play Parfumerie by Hungarian playwright Miklos Laszlo\, following the 1940 James Stewart-Margaret Sullavan film The Shop around the Corner and the 1949 Judy Garland-Van Johnson musical version In the Good Old Summertime.   The 1978 BBC version starring Robin Ellis and Gemma Craven is worth watching too.  It would surface yet again in 1998 as the Tom Hanks-Meg Ryan feature You've Got Mail. The plot revolves around Budapest shop employees Georg Nowack and Amalia Balash who\, despite being consistently at odds with each other at work\, are unaware that each is the other's secret pen pal met through lonely-hearts ads. The musical premiered on Broadway in 1963\, and subsequently had productions in the West End in 1964 and award-winning revivals on each side of the Atlantic in the 1990s\, as well as regional productions. ***	0

COL title VAL Spill the Wine COL performer VAL Eric Burdon Brian Auger Band	COL video title VAL You're Just In Love - Perry Como COL channel name VAL Maureen712 COL description VAL "You're Just in Love" is a popular song by Irving Berlin. It was published in 1950 and was first performed by Ethel Merman and Russell Nype in Call Me Madam\, a musical comedy that debuted at the Imperial Theatre in New York City on October 12 that year. The show ran for 644 performances. Ethel Merman also later starred in the 1953 film version. Theatre lore has it that Berlin wrote the song one night after Call Me Madam was not doing well in tryouts. The second act of the show was lacking. "What I'd like to do is a song with the kid (Russell Nype)\," Merman said. So\, Berlin went to his room and later produced the counterpoint song. When Berlin played the song for Merman\, she said "We'll never get off the stage." According to Berlin's biographer though\, Berlin played the song for Russell Nype first\, but admonished him not to admit he did so because it would infuriate Merman.  Several recorded versions made the charts in 1950-51: by Perry Como and The Fontane Sisters\, by Rosemary Clooney and Guy Mitchell\, and by Ethel Merman and Dick Haymes.  The Perry Como/Fontane Sisters version was recorded on September 26\, 1950 and released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number 20-3945. The record first reached the Billboard magazine charts on December 22\, 1950 and lasted 17 weeks on the chart\, peaking at #5.  The Rosemary Clooney/Guy Mitchell version was recorded on October 21\, 1950 and released by Columbia Records as catalog number 39052. The record first reached the Billboard magazine charts on February 23\, 1951 and lasted 2 weeks on the chart\, peaking at #29.  The Ethel Merman/Dick Haymes version was recorded on October 17\, 1950 and released by Decca Records as catalog number 27317. The record first reached the Billboard magazine charts on March 30\, 1951 and lasted 1 week on the chart\, at #30. Although the lowest charting of the three\, it got a considerable amount of airplay in subsequent years.  Musically\, the song is one of Irving Berlin's three well-known songs that use true counterpoint—a main melody with a secondary melody running at the same time\, both with independent lyrics - his two other best-known counterpoint songs are Play a Simple Melody and "An Old-Fashioned Wedding" (see the 1966 revival of "Annie Get Your Gun").	0
COL title VAL Ich weiss nicht zu wem ich gehöre COL performer VAL Hildegard Knef	COL video title VAL Elly Lapp - Ich weiß nicht zu wem ich gehöre.wmv COL channel name VAL schwarzantigone COL description VAL Elly Lapp Ganz nah  Genre: Deutsch-Pop\, Chanson\, Schlager   „Eine Stimme die unter die Haut geht.  Eindringlich\, lasziv\, ganz nah."   Elly Lapp liebt die Brückenschläge. Für sie sind UFA-Schlager und Popmusik keine  unarrangierbaren Gegensätze\, sondern interpretatorische Herausforderung. Dabei ist eine sehr moderne CD entstanden\,  die gleichzeitig sehr intensiv und sehr persönlich ist. Viel näher geht`s nicht.   Es waren große Songs -- es sind große Songs. Dazu leistet eine interessante Interpretin ihren Beitrag. Elly Lapp. Die studierte Schauspielerin und Sängerin tourt mit eigenen Programmen durch Deutschland -- und sie war die Stimme des Titelsongs der erfolgreichen ARD-Fernsehserie „Kir Royal".  „Der Wind hat mir ein Lied erzählt" - gleichzeitig erste Single - und „Ich steh` im Regen" sind Versuche einer ungewöhnlichen Verbindung von UFA - HIT und POPSOUND. Zarah Leander machte einst diese Songs zu Welterfolgen. Damals hatten die Autoren wohl nie eine Umsetzung mit rockigen Gitarren oder Saxophon im Auge. Hier geben die modernen Instrumente\, wie das gesamte Pop- Arrangement\, eine ganz neue Farbe -- voller Intensität.  Doch die CD von Elly Lapp zeigt die großen Filmhits nicht nur im Popgewand\, sondern auch sehr sparsam\, kunstvoll arrangiert\, als Chansons mit großer interpretatorischer Tiefe.  z.B." Wenn ich mir was wünschen dürfte" und - vor allem - „Der Nowack lässt mich nicht verkommen" -\, ein wahrer Kultsong\, 1959 geschrieben\, sofort auf Schallplatte aufgenommen\, kurzerhand von einem Münchner Gericht verboten und wieder eingestampft -- eine echte Rarität für jedes Rundfunk- und Privatarchiv!	1

This was recorded as part of the Sue Keller seminar presentation on "Women and the Blues".  The piece is a composition by Ida Cox from the early 20's titled\, "Wild Women Don't Have The Blues".  The presentation covered the following early blues women: Mamie Smith\, Bessie Smith\, Ma Rainey\, Lucille Hegamin\, Ida Cox\, Alberta Hunter and their influences on Ella May Morse\, Billie Holiday\, Etta James\, Patsy Cline\, Marcia Ball\, and Aretha Franklin.  The reference at the end is to how Sue used to play this as a rock tune with the Jeanne French Band in Boston back in the 70's... Jeanne's in Singapore now but her version is track #4 on her Mean Man Blues album available on buy.com.  Lyle Lovett also does a very nice version\, but uses lyrics modified by Francine Reed.

His first recordings were in the Cool Jazz style and after his collaboration with Martin Denny he finally created his very own style \, excelling in moody  Vibraphone /Marimba dominated modern Hawaiian Jazz.. Adventures was originally composed by Lionel Newman \, a member of a great  composers dynasty . It was created as TV theme for the popular TV series \, wich is introduced in this video at the first 17 seconds .The first series ran from 1958 till 1961. Lyman recorded "Adventures " in 1961  on the Ryckodisc label.It was part of the  famous Yellow Bird album. Starring in this video are also some guest stars from the TV series back then. The eclectic sound of Lyman's music justifys a good audiosystem \, or the use of headphones.These records were produced by the sound engineer Richard Vaughn in the beginning day's of stereo recording \, and were quite inventive in those day's.

Talk about a lead singer being camera shy - you only saw his face maybe 5 or 6 times during the performance. Most of the time his back was to the audience. Being that I saw them over 44 yrs ago\, the only thing that I can remember about them was that they didn't seem very tight and they still looked like they were trying to find their place. I can't recall any songs that they did\, although I do recall that two of them were blues covers."	0

Purchase from the label: http://www.paradiseofbachelors.com/shop/pob-21 Purchase from Bandcamp: https://paradiseofbachelors.bandcamp.com/album/ambsace Other options: http://lnk.to/PoB21  The second album of astonishing duets by guitarists James Elkington (who has toured and/or recorded with Jeff Tweedy\, Richard Thompson\, and Steve Gunn\, among others) and Nathan Salsburg (an accomplished soloist deemed by NPR “one of those names we’ll all associate with American folk guitar”) is a sublime suite of nimble\, filigreed compositions by two singular stylists. Belying its title—“ambsace” is the lowest throw of dice; snake eyes—the record thrives on a gentle empathy and generosity of spirit\, sitting sneakily protean original compositions alongside gorgeous arrangements of songs by Duke Ellington and The Smiths at the same big hand-hewn table.

COL title VAL Yankee Doodle Boy COL performer VAL Billy Murray	COL video title VAL PAUL JABARA Yankee Doodle Dandy COL channel name VAL daveinprogress3 COL description VAL With the imminent Independence day holiday\, I am posting this odd little minor hit from Oscar and Grammy winning Paul Jabara. Best known for the hits 'No more Tears'\, 'Last Dance' and 'It's raining men'\, Jabara died in 1992. His classic songs have been with me all these years & are among my all time favourite compositions. He left us way too soon.  'Yankee Doodle Dandy' it seems was never released as an A side single in America\, but it did show up on the Australian charts for a solitary week back in June of 1978\, entering the Top 100 at #99.

(Brown's Sex Machine double album\, also released in 1970\, contains a different\, 11-minute-long performance of the song rather than the version released as a single.)  "Sex Machine" was one of the first songs Brown recorded with his new band\, The J.B.'s. In comparison with his 1960s funk hits such as "Papa's Got A Brand New Bag" and "Cold Sweat"\, it is notable for the de-emphasis of the horn section. Instead\, the song centers on the insistent riff played by brothers Bootsy and Catfish Collins on bass and guitar and Jabo Starks on drums\, along with the call and response interplay between Brown and Bobby Byrd's vocals.  The original single version of "Sex Machine" begins with a brief spoken dialogue between Brown and the members of his band\, which was recreated (with minor variations) in live performances: Fellas\, I'm ready to get up and do my thing! (Yeah! That's right! Do it!) I want to get into it\, man\, you know? (Go ahead! Yeah!) Like a\, like a sex machine\, man\, (Yeah!) movin'\, doin' it\, y'know? (Yeah!) Can I count it off? (Okay! Alright!) One\, two\, three\, four!  The song's freeform lyrics consist mostly of Brown's exhortations to "Get up / stay on the scene / like a sex machine" along with Byrd's regular shouts of "Get on up." The piece is harmonically static\, aside from a move to the subdominant on the bridge.  In 2004\, "Sex Machine" was ranked number 326 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest songs of all time.  Other versions  Brown recorded a reworking of the original song for his 1975 album Sex Machine Today.  The Flying Lizards recorded a successful cover of "Sex Machine" in 1984 which appeared on their album Top Ten.  In 1986 the Japanese musician Haruomi Hosono and his band F.O.E. recorded vocal and instrumental cover versions of "Sex Machine" for the album F.O.E. #1: Sex\, Energy and Star. The instrumental version featured a guest solo by Brown's longtime saxophonist Maceo Parker.  German comedian and jazz musician Helge Schneider recorded a comedic version of the song for his 1995 album Es rappelt im Karton. It was also released as a single with an accompanying video that features Schneider walking around a metro station making faces.  The rock band Widespread Panic covered the song on their 2004 live album Jackassolantern.  Jazz fusion/Blues guitarist Larry Coryell covered the song on his album Electric.  Sampling  Sy Smith and her back-up singer LeJon Walker sampled the song during their performance of "Think (About It)"\, which is featured on her DVD Sy Smith Live: Worship at the Temple.  Appearances in other media  "Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine" has appeared in a number of feature films\, including City of God\, Twisted\, Legally Blonde\, Lock\, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\, Friday and The Tuxedo (in which it is performed by Jackie Chan). It has also been used in an episode of the television sitcom Scrubs and in commercials for the Renault Clio and Tassimo. The song was featured on the Pontiac commercial.  The song figures prominently in the 2003 Japanese film Get Up!\, a comedy about a James Brown-obsessed yakuza gangster. The film's title (which transliterates into Japanese as Geroppa!) is taken from the song's lyrics.  British satirical puppet show Spitting Image ended an episode with an opera-style cover of the song\, starring Luciano Pavarotti.  Part 1 of "Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine" is available as downloadable content for the Rock Band series of video games.	0

Train of love's now hastin' Sweethearts standin' waitin' Here and there and everywhere They're gonna be embracin' Trainman tell me maybe Ain't you got my baby  Every so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam But everybody's baby but mine's comin' home.  Train of love is leavin' Leavin' my heart grievin' Bur early or late\, I sit and wait Because I'm still believin' We'll walk away together Though I may wait forever  Every so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam But everybody's baby but mine's comin' home.	0

COL title VAL I Forgot to Be Your Lover COL performer VAL Tommy Tate	COL video title VAL Bill Keith Homestead on The Farm COL channel name VAL Marcus Brazil COL description VAL William Bradford Keith was born in Boston\, Massachusetts. He attended Amherst College and graduated in 1961. In 1963 he became a member of Bill Monroe's Bluegrass Boys.   Keith's recordings and performances during these nine months with Monroe permanently altered banjo playing\, and his style has become an important part of the playing styles of many banjoists. After leaving the Bluegrass Boys\, he joined "Jim Kweskin Jug Band" playing plectrum banjo. He began playing the steel guitar and soon after 1968\, found himself working together with Ian and Sylvia and Jonathan Edwards. In the 1970s Keith recorded for Rounder Records. Over the years he has performed with several other musicians\, such as Clarence White and David Grisman in Muleskinner\, Tony Trischka\, Jim Rooney and Jim Collier. Today\, Keith style is still regarded as modern or progressive in the context of bluegrass banjo playing.    Keith made a mechanical contribution to the banjo\, as well. He designed a specialized type of banjo tuning peg that facilitates changing quickly from one open tuning to another\, while playing. Earlier famed banjoist Earl Scruggs had designed a set of cams which were added to the banjo to perform this task. Keith's invention made the extra hardware unnecessary\, replacing two of the tuning machines already on the banjo — a more elegant solution. Scruggs himself became a partner in the venture for a while\, and the product was known as "Scruggs-Keith Pegs". Known today simply as Keith Pegs\, they remain the state of the art\, and Bill Keith continues to manufacture and market them personally as the primary product of his own company\, the Beacon Banjo Company.	0

Que j'me démène ou qu'je reste coi Je passe pour un je-ne-sais-quoi  Je ne fais pourtant de tort à  personne En suivant mon chemin de petit bonhomme. Mais les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Non les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Tout le monde médit de moi\, Sauf les muets\, ça va de soi.  Le jour du Quatorze Juillet Je reste dans mon lit douillet. La musique qui marche au pas\, Cela ne me regarde pas.  Je ne fais pourtant de tort à  personne\, En n'écoutant pas le clairon qui sonne. Mais les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Non les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Tout le monde me montre du doigt Sauf les manchots\, ça va de soi.  Quand j'croise un voleur malchanceux\, Poursuivi par un cul-terreux; J'lance la patte et pourquoi le taire\, Le cul-terreux s'retrouve par terre  Je ne fais pourtant de tort à  personne\, En laissant courir les voleurs de pommes. Mais les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Non les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Tout le monde se rue sur moi\, Sauf les culs-de-jatte\, ça va de soi.  Pas besoin d'être Jérémie\, Pour d'viner l'sort qui m'est promis\, S'ils trouvent une corde à  leur goût\, Ils me la passeront au cou\,  Je ne fais pourtant de tort à  personne\, En suivant les ch'mins qui n'mènent pas à  Rome\, Mais les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Non les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Tout l'mond' viendra me voir pendu\, Sauf les aveugles\, bien entendu.

Entre esas canciones se incluyen conocidos números 1 como "When I Need You"\, "Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now" (nominada a los Oscar®\, los Globos de Oro y los Grammy)\, "One Moment in Time" y "To All the Girls I've Loved Before". Auténticos himnos musicales como "One Moment in  Time"\, una canción que compuso para que se convirtiera en el tema oficial de los Juegos Olímpicos en 1988 y que llevó a Albert a recibir su primer Emmy\, y "Cantaré\, Cantarás" (el equivalente en el mercado de música en español del clásico "We Are the World")\, un tema que Albert co-escribió y produjo\, son dos ejemplos de la capacidad de Albert Hammond para componer canciones que se instalan desde el principio en el inconsciente colectivo de millones de personas.  Albert es un experto colaborador con un gran talento con la guitarra\, el piano y la interpretación vocal\, y ha formado  parte de algunos de los equipos de compositores con mayor éxito en la industria discográfica. Junto a su colega en labores de composición Mike Hazlewood\, con el que ha trabajado durante muchos años\, ha co-escrito muchos de sus éxitos\, entre ellos el clásico "The Air that I Breathe". Además\, Albert ha co-escrito grandes temas de éxito junto a Diane Warren\, entre ellos el famoso "I Don't Wanna Live Without Your Love" de Chicago\, "Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now" de Starship\, "Careless Heart" de Roy Orbison\, "Don't You Love Me Anymore" de Joe Cocker y "Don't Turn Around"\, una canción que ha alcanzado el éxito en tres ocasiones en las voces de Ace of Base\, Neil Diamond y el grupo Aswad. Asimismo\, Albert también ha compuesto  diversos éxitos junto a Hal David ("99 Miles from L.A." y "To All the Girls I've Loved Before") y John Bettis ("One Moment  in Time"\, "When You Tell Me That You Love Me" y "I Need To Be In Love"\, el gran éxito que popularizó el grupo The  Carpenters).  Entre las estrellas que han grabado canciones compuestas por Albert Hammond se encuentran muchos de los artistas más importantes del panorama musical contemporáneo\, incluyendo a Celine Dion\, Whitney Houston\, Aretha Franklin\, Tina Turner\, Elton John\, Joe Cocker\, Diana Ross\, Johnny Cash\, K.D. Lang\, Julio Iglesias y Josh Groban\, entre otros grandes nombres.  En 2008 Albert recibió la invitación para incorporarse al prestigioso Songwriter's Hall of Fame\, y también ha recibido la Orden del Imperio Británico (OBE) de manos de Su Majestad la Reina Isabel II de Inglaterra. Gibraltar\, la ciudad donde creció\, ofrecerá próximamente un homenaje a Albert Hammond a través de la edición de una serie de sellos postales conmemorativos que incluirán su imagen y destacarán asimismo sus mayores éxitos internacionales.	0

COL title VAL Why (Am I Treated So Bad) COL performer VAL James Brown	COL video title VAL Betty Johnson -- I Need You Now (VintageMusic.es) COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Betty Johnson 16 de marzo 1929 (otras fuentes dicen 1931)  es una cantante norteamericana que alcanzó su pico de carrera en la década de 1950. Cuando era adolescente\, fue contratada por Columbia Records e hizo algunas grabaciones\, ninguna de las cuales tuvieron éxito. En 1951\, Percy Faith \, que la había conocido por sus grabaciones de Columbia\, trató de convencer a Mitch Miller ( A & R\, el director de Columbia) para firmar con ella\, pero Miller\, que incluye Doris Day y Rosemary Clooney \, entre los artistas que habían firmado\, no veía la necesidad firmar con ella.  Johnson lanzó el álbum para niños\, con Eddy Arnold producido por Simon and Schuster \, que posteriormente la contrató para su propio sello discográfico\, Bell Records en 1954. En el mismo año firmó un contrato con Csida-Grean\, una sociedad de gestión que había manejado la carrera de Arnold. Charles Grean\, miembro  de esa compañía\,  produjo muchas de sus grabaciones posteriores. En 1955\, firmó un contrato con RCA Victor Records \, que la envió a Chicago\, Illinois .  En Chicago\, Johnson trabajó con Arnold de nuevo en su  serie\, Eddy Arnold Time\, respaldado por un grupo que había trabajado con su familia en el Grand Ole Opry\, The Jordanaires . Este grupo más tarde fue conocido como un grupo de apoyo de Elvis Presley .  En 1957 se casó con Grean\, aunque el matrimonio sólo duraría hasta 1961\, la relación profesional continuó. Luego fue contratada por Jack Paar para su programa de televisión\, Tonight . Esto condujo a un contrato discográfico con Atlantic Records en 1957\, para el que tuvo su próximo gran éxito\, "Little Blue Man".  Johnson continuó en Tonight hasta 1962 cuando Jack Paar fue reemplazado por Johnny Carson.

COL title VAL The Unforgiven COL performer VAL The Defiled	COL video title VAL Hello Stranger - The Supremes & The Four Tops COL channel name VAL MotownConnoisseur30 COL description VAL Here is another outstanding cover from the third duet album from The Supremes & The Four Tops entitled "Dynamite" from 1971.  Aside from Barbara Lewis' 1963 original\, I think this version is the best of all the covers ever done of the song. It is musical perfection.  Written by: Barbara Lewis Produced by: Bobby Taylor and Frank Wilson Track recorded: May 3\, 1971 Additional overdubs\, strings and horn sessions recorded in Los Angeles: Dates unknown Levi Stubbs lead vocal recorded: June 5\, 1971 & August 17\, 1971 Four Tops background vocals recorded: June 9\, 1971 Jean Terrell lead vocal recorded: June 10\, 1971 Supremes background vocals recorded: June 24\, 1971  This version is the best song on the entire LP and one of the best duets the groups did together over the three albums. Motown was foolish not to release this as a single. It screams hit and would have been one had Motown promoted it\, but at the time The Supremes and The Four Tops were no longer Motown's top priority. Nonetheless\, it still remains an incredible cover.  ****No copyright infringement intended****	0
