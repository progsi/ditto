I was thinking that you could be trusted Did you have to ruin what was shiny? Now it's all rusted Did you have to hit me\, where I'm weak? Baby\, I couldn't breathe And rub it in so deep\, salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me  Oh\, it's so sad to think about the good times\, you and I  'Cause\, baby\, now we got bad blood You know it used to be mad love So take a look what you've done 'Cause\, baby\, now we got bad blood Hey Now we got problems And I don't think we can solve them You made a really deep cut And\, baby\, now we got bad blood Hey  Did you think we'd be fine? Still got scars on my back from your knife So don't think it's in the past\, these kinda wounds they last and they last. Now did you think it all through? All these things will catch up to you And time can heal but this won't\, so if you're coming my way\, just don't  Oh\, it's so sad to think about the good times\, you and I  'Cause\, baby\, now we got bad blood You know it used to be mad love So take a look what you've done 'Cause\, baby\, now we got bad blood Hey Now we got problems And I don't think we can solve them You made a really deep cut And\, baby\, now we got bad blood Hey  Band-aids don't fix bullet holes You say sorry just for show If you live like that\, you live with ghosts (ghosts) Band-aids don't fix bullet holes (hey) You say sorry just for show (hey) If you live like that\, you live with ghosts (hey) If you love like that blood runs cold  'Cause\, baby\, now we got bad blood You know it used to be mad love (mad love) So take a look what you've done 'Cause\, baby\, now we got bad blood Hey Now we got problems And I don't think we can solve them (think we can solve them) You made a really deep cut And\, baby\, now we got bad blood (Hey)	0

COL title VAL C'era un ragazzo che come me amava i Beatles e i Rolling Stones COL performer VAL Joan Baez	COL video title VAL Jerry Lee Lewis - Let's Talk About Us COL channel name VAL Music Legends Book COL description VAL Jerry Lee Lewis (born September 29\, 1935) is an American singer-songwriter\, musician\, and pianist\, who is often known by his nickname of The Killer and is often viewed as "rock & roll's first great wild man." As an early pioneer of rock and roll music\, in 1956 Lewis made his first recordings at Sun Records in Memphis. "Crazy Arms" sold 300\,000 copies in the South\, but it was his 1957 hit "Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On" that shot Lewis to fame worldwide. Lewis followed this when he recorded songs such as "Great Balls of Fire"\, "Breathless" and "High School Confidential". However\, Lewis's rock and roll career faltered in the wake of his marriage to his 13-year-old cousin when he was 22. He had little success in the charts following the scandal and his popularity quickly faded. His live performance fees plummeted from $10\,000 per night to $250. In the meantime he was determined to gain back some of his popularity. During the early 1960s he didn't have much chart success with few exceptions such as "What'd I Say". His live performances at this time were increasingly wild and energetic. His album Live at the Star Club\, Hamburg from 1964 is often regarded by many music journalists and fans as one of the wildest and greatest rock and roll concert albums ever. After recording songs such as "I'm on Fire" for several years with little success\, in 1968 Lewis made a transition into country music and had hits with songs such as "Another Place\, Another Time". This reignited his career and throughout the late 1960s and 1970s he regularly topped the country-western charts. His No. 1 country hits included "To Make Love Sweeter For You"\, "There Must Be More to Love Than This"\, "Would You Take Another Chance on Me" and "Me and Bobby McGee"	0

Era el verano claro está\, y yo empezaba a soñar con mi pasado. Ante un espejo le fingí que maquillaba mi nariz para mirarle. Cuando me vi tan cerca de él había dado no sé qué por conquistarle.  Me sonrió con intención y fue su edad la explicación de su victoria. No quiso hablarme del amor\, pues según él esa cuestión es otra historia. Me dijo tú me vas muy bien\, eres igual que la mujer de "El Graduado". Yo no pude resistir y entre sus brazos descubrí\, un sol dorado.  Dieciocho años nada más eso le hizo ser audaz mas que insolente. Cuando llegué a despertar\, solo sentí la soledad indiferente. Por un momento pretendí el retenerlo junto a mí\, pero no quise. Me dijo no has estado mal\, con un candor tan infernal\, antes de irse. Entonces tuve que fingir que maquillaba mi nariz\, para no verle y estuve a punto de olvidar que yo le doblaba la edad.	0

It was released on their debut album A Flock of Seagulls in 1982 and was its most successful single\, reaching number 9 in the United States and number 1 in Australia.  Single  The single was promoted by a distinctive music video in which the band members performed in a room covered in aluminum foil and mirrors. The cameras used to film the video are clearly visible in many of the background reflections\, their stands also covered in foil. The video is a homage to Brian Eno and Robert Fripp's (No Pussyfooting) album cover\, which was also respectively portrayed by The Strokes for their single\, "The End Has No End" two decades later. The video received heavy rotation on MTV in the summer of 1982\, and helped the single to become a hit. The video features a different edit of "I Ran" than the album version; the introduction was greatly shortened.  The band toured the United States extensively to promote the single\, supporting Squeeze on their 1982 tour. As well as reaching #9 on the Billboard Hot 100\, "I Ran" peaked at #3 on the Mainstream Rock chart and #8 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. Subsequently the album reached number 10 on the Billboard 200.  Despite success in the States and Australia\, the single did not enjoy similar success in the band's home country (United Kingdom)\, failing to make the top 40.  In an interview on the VH1 special 100 Greatest Songs of the '80s\, Mike Score said that he resents the song\, but plays it live because people enjoy it. "I Ran" was listed at #55 on the countdown. In VH1's 100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders of the 80s\, the song was listed at #2\, with Mike Score's interview played again.  Although considered an '80s New Wave classic\, the song experienced somewhat of a revival in 2002 as the signature theme for the video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City; being played during the game's television commercials and during gameplay as one of the songs in the playlist for radio station Wave 103.  Along with the Bowling for Soup cover\, it was also used as the theme song for the English dub of the anime series Knights of the Zodiac which was later removed from the air during its first season.  The song briefly featured in the Dead Zone Season 2 episode 'Playing God'\, heard during a party scene. It can also be heard during a nightclub scene in the 2005 Nick Love film The Business.  The master recording is available as a playable song in Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s as well as the rebooted version of Karaoke Revolution. The song was from the TV show Everybody Hates Chris entitled Everybody Hates the Last Day  It was performed by the Ska Rangers in the film The Hangover: Part II during the closing scene.  Also\, Fez sung a verse in That 70's Show during one of the "Circles" in the fourth season's opener.  Cover versions  "I Ran" has been covered by a number of artists:  Tori Amos covered the song on her Original Sinsuality/Summer Of Sin Tour in Denver\, during Piano Bar Time. Her version was released with the rest of the show in the 3rd CD of The Original Bootlegs.  Assemblage 23 recorded the song for the 1997 compilation Newer Wave.  Cranial Screwtop recorded a version of the song for their 2006 album "Too Fast for Technology".  Terminal Choice's cover of the song is included on the bonus disk of their 2006 album New Born Enemies.  Bowling for Soup covered the song for the 2003 re-release of their album Drunk Enough to Dance and their "Punk Rock 101" single. Both the original and the punk cover are the theme song of the American version of Saint Seiya\, also known as Knights of the Zodiac.  Hidden in Plain View recorded the song on the covers compilation album Punk Goes 80s.  In Dance Dance Revolution: Hottest Party 2\, Spacebar vs Naughty G covered this song.  Darude and Blake Lewis released a cover in 2008.  Nickelback covered the song during their Dark Horse Tour in 2010. It was sung by guitarist/vocalist Ryan Peake.  Slim Thug also took the bass line of this song to produce his single "I Run"  Umphrey's Mcgee covered the song during a performance at the Birmingham Southern College on 4/9/05\, however they have played it many times before.  Ska Rangers covered the song which featured on the film and soundtrack of The Hangover: Part II.	0

COL title VAL The Only Living Boy in New York COL performer VAL David Mead	COL video title VAL You're Just In Love - Perry Como COL channel name VAL Maureen712 COL description VAL "You're Just in Love" is a popular song by Irving Berlin. It was published in 1950 and was first performed by Ethel Merman and Russell Nype in Call Me Madam\, a musical comedy that debuted at the Imperial Theatre in New York City on October 12 that year. The show ran for 644 performances. Ethel Merman also later starred in the 1953 film version. Theatre lore has it that Berlin wrote the song one night after Call Me Madam was not doing well in tryouts. The second act of the show was lacking. "What I'd like to do is a song with the kid (Russell Nype)\," Merman said. So\, Berlin went to his room and later produced the counterpoint song. When Berlin played the song for Merman\, she said "We'll never get off the stage." According to Berlin's biographer though\, Berlin played the song for Russell Nype first\, but admonished him not to admit he did so because it would infuriate Merman.  Several recorded versions made the charts in 1950-51: by Perry Como and The Fontane Sisters\, by Rosemary Clooney and Guy Mitchell\, and by Ethel Merman and Dick Haymes.  The Perry Como/Fontane Sisters version was recorded on September 26\, 1950 and released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number 20-3945. The record first reached the Billboard magazine charts on December 22\, 1950 and lasted 17 weeks on the chart\, peaking at #5.  The Rosemary Clooney/Guy Mitchell version was recorded on October 21\, 1950 and released by Columbia Records as catalog number 39052. The record first reached the Billboard magazine charts on February 23\, 1951 and lasted 2 weeks on the chart\, peaking at #29.  The Ethel Merman/Dick Haymes version was recorded on October 17\, 1950 and released by Decca Records as catalog number 27317. The record first reached the Billboard magazine charts on March 30\, 1951 and lasted 1 week on the chart\, at #30. Although the lowest charting of the three\, it got a considerable amount of airplay in subsequent years.  Musically\, the song is one of Irving Berlin's three well-known songs that use true counterpoint—a main melody with a secondary melody running at the same time\, both with independent lyrics - his two other best-known counterpoint songs are Play a Simple Melody and "An Old-Fashioned Wedding" (see the 1966 revival of "Annie Get Your Gun").	0

Released as a single in May 1970 (backed by the non-album track "Magic Mountain")\, it was War's first chart hit\, peaking at number three. It was also a top three hit in Canada and Australia. It charted #15 in Netherlands and #28 in Germany.  In 1996\, it was remixed by Junior Vasquez and released as a single again.  Lonnie Jordan said in an 2008 interview that Eric Burdon is the first Latin rapper in pop music.  In the introduction to the live version of the song on Greatest Hits Live\, Lonnie Jordan reveals that the inspiration for the song was a time when he spilled a glass of wine on a mixing board in the recording studio. Eric Burdon found the event funny\, so he and Jordan used it as the inspiration for the song.  Use in film  "Spill the Wine" was used in the popular motion pictures Boogie Nights\, Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo and Remember the Titans.  It was also sung during the The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air episode\, "That's No Lady\, That's My Cousin".  The song can also be heard in the Dexter episode "A Horse of a Different Color"\, while main characters Joey Quinn and Angel Batista are smoking a joint.  Cover versions  The song has been covered by: The Isley Brothers for their 1971 album Givin' It All Back\, as well as by The B-Side Players\, Juan Ma y su Sonido Costeño\, 2NU on their 1989 album Ponderous\, Lalo Schifrin\, Melvin Sparks\, Michael Hutchence\, The Dream Syndicate\, Lighter Shade of Brown\, Los Mocosos and Freaked Out Flower Children.  In 2004\, flautist Alexander Zonjic performed a cover for his album "Seldom Blues."  In 2012\, the revival of the 1970's band The L.A. Carpool\, covered Spill the Wine with a Latin salsa flare. The cover features well known Latin drummer Richie "Gajate" Garcia among many other well known Latin musicians.	0

She speaks fluently Spanish\, English and Italian. Due to her great voice\, she has been compared to famous international singers\, to Whitney Houston above all. Session vocalist for various Dance productions in the 90's\, she's been performing a lot around the World and has taken part in many TV shows in Italy. She's also an author: she wrote for Mario Biondi on the albums 'Handful of soul' and 'I love you more'\, she co-wrote most of the songs on the Papik album 'Rhythm of life'\, together with her producer Nerio Poggi (aka Papik)\, including 'Staying for Good'\, the single from the album that's getting a great response worldwide. This is her first album under her own name and it's dedicated to remakes in a soul-jazz style of tunes from the 80's and 90's. Among the songs chosen: a bossa cover of 'Rhythm of the night' by Corona and an R&B version of 'Barbie Girl'. But the self-penned '1986' is the real gem on this album!

Inez sang lead vocal\, while Charlie sang back-up and played guitar.[1]   Their most successful record was with their novelty composition\, "Mockingbird". Released in 1963\, it made the Top 10 on both the rhythm and blues and pop charts; the song was later covered by artists including Aretha Franklin\, James Taylor\, Carly Simon\, Dusty Springfield and Toby Keith. Other notable recordings were "Hurt by Love\," "Ask Me\," and "(1-2-3-4-5-6-7) Count the Days."   They were known for their exciting live performances\, of which a highlight was Inez's rendition of "I Stand Accused"\, which finished with a supposedly distraught Inez singing the last verse\, while being carried offstage by Charlie. They toured extensively in Europe and their music played a key role in the development of the Northern Soul movement.   Inez also had some success recording on her own\, beginning in 1969\, but her popularity faded in the 1970s. Charlie was already working as a record producer when they finally disbanded their act.   Inez Foxx was married to the American songwriter and producer Luther Dixon. Together they wrote\, and he produced\, The Platters' mid-1960s return to hit-making with the single "I Love You 1000 Times".[2] Luther Dixon produced Inez and Charlie's 1967 album Come By Here\, but the couple later divorced.[2]   Charlie Foxx died from leukemia in 1998\, at the age of 58.	0

COL title VAL Hunting High and Low COL performer VAL Silje Nergaard	COL video title VAL Jerry Lee Lewis - Let's Talk About Us COL channel name VAL Music Legends Book COL description VAL Jerry Lee Lewis (born September 29\, 1935) is an American singer-songwriter\, musician\, and pianist\, who is often known by his nickname of The Killer and is often viewed as "rock & roll's first great wild man." As an early pioneer of rock and roll music\, in 1956 Lewis made his first recordings at Sun Records in Memphis. "Crazy Arms" sold 300\,000 copies in the South\, but it was his 1957 hit "Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On" that shot Lewis to fame worldwide. Lewis followed this when he recorded songs such as "Great Balls of Fire"\, "Breathless" and "High School Confidential". However\, Lewis's rock and roll career faltered in the wake of his marriage to his 13-year-old cousin when he was 22. He had little success in the charts following the scandal and his popularity quickly faded. His live performance fees plummeted from $10\,000 per night to $250. In the meantime he was determined to gain back some of his popularity. During the early 1960s he didn't have much chart success with few exceptions such as "What'd I Say". His live performances at this time were increasingly wild and energetic. His album Live at the Star Club\, Hamburg from 1964 is often regarded by many music journalists and fans as one of the wildest and greatest rock and roll concert albums ever. After recording songs such as "I'm on Fire" for several years with little success\, in 1968 Lewis made a transition into country music and had hits with songs such as "Another Place\, Another Time". This reignited his career and throughout the late 1960s and 1970s he regularly topped the country-western charts. His No. 1 country hits included "To Make Love Sweeter For You"\, "There Must Be More to Love Than This"\, "Would You Take Another Chance on Me" and "Me and Bobby McGee"	0

Hurt)  Recorded: New York City\, December 28\,1928 Mississippi John Hurt (vcl)(g).  Born John Smith Hurt in Teoc\,  Carroll County\, Mississippi and raised in Avalon\, Mississippi\, Hurt learned to play guitar at age 9. He spent much of his youth playing old time music for friends and dances\, earning a living as a farm hand into the 1920s. In 1923 he partnered with the fiddle player Willie Narmour as a substitute for his regular partner Shell Smith. When Narmour got a chance to record for Okeh Records as a prize for winning first place in a 1928 fiddle contest\, Narmour recommended John Hurt to Okeh Records producer Tommy Rockwell. After auditioning "Monday Morning Blues" at his home\, he took part in two recording sessions\, in Memphis and New York City (see Discography below). The "Mississippi" tag was added by Okeh as a sales gimmick. After the commercial failure of the resulting records\, and Okeh Records going out of business during the Great Depression\, Hurt returned to Avalon and obscurity\, working as a sharecropper and playing local parties and dances.  In 1963\, however\, a folk musicologist\, Tom Hoskins\, inspired by the recordings\, was able to locate Hurt near Avalon\, Mississippi. Seeing that Hurt's guitar playing skills were still intact\, Hoskins encouraged him to move to Washington\, D.C.\, and begin performing on a wider stage. His performance at the 1964 Newport Folk Festival saw his star rise amongst the new folk revival audience. Before his death he played extensively in colleges\, concert halls\, coffee houses and also on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson\, as well as recording three further albums for Vanguard Records. The numbers his devotees particularly liked were the ragtime songs "Salty Dog" and "Candy Man"\, and the blues ballads "Spike Driver Blues" (a variant of "John Henry") and "Frankie".  Hurt's influence spanned several music genres including blues\, country\, bluegrass\, folk and contemporary rock and roll. A soft-spoken man\, his nature was reflected in the work\, which remained a mellow mix of country\, blues and old time music to the end.[7]  Hurt died in November 1966 from a heart attack in Grenada\, Mississippi	0

Kalifornia  ------------------------  "California Über Alles" was the first single by the Dead Kennedys.  The record was released in June 1979 on Optional Music with "The Man with the Dogs" as the b-side. The title track was re-recorded for the band's first album\, Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables (1980)\, and the version that appeared on this single\, as well as the single's b-side\, are available on the rarities album Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death (1987).  The lyrics were written by Jello Biafra and John Greenway\, and Biafra composed the music in one of his rare attempts at composing on bass.  This song was featured in the video game Tony Hawk's American Wasteland and as a downloadable song in the Rock Band series. It is also sampled in a song by the Dance-Punk/Big beat trio The Prodigy\, "Dead Ken Beats".  The song was also featured in the 2010 film\, The Social Network.  Meaning  The title is an allusion to the first (and no longer sung) stanza of the national anthem of Germany\, which begins with the words "Deutschland\, Deutschland über alles." (literally\, "Germany\, Germany above all.")  The song focuses on Jerry Brown\, the Governor of California 1975-1983 and 2011--present\, and is sung from his perspective. An imaginary Brown outlines a hippie-fascist vision for America\, in which his "suede denim secret police" kill un-cool people with "organic poison gas" chambers. Lines such as "Serpent's egg already hatched" (a reference to a line from William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar) comment on the corrosive nature of power. The line "now it is 1984" refers to the totalitarian regime of George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four\, describing a future (from 1979) where Jerry Brown has become President Brown presiding over secret police and gas chambers.  The song is an early example of the Kennedys' trademark use of menace and musical tension. It fades in with sinister military-styled drums\, joined by an ominous bass riff. Biafra paints the scene in low\, sneering tones before bursting in manic chanting chorus: "California Über Alles [x2]\, Über Alles\, California [x2]". After two verses and choruses\, the song shifts into a slower middle eight section set to a martial drum beat over which Jello Biafra imagines the nightmarish actions of Brown's SS-styled secret police ("Come quietly to the camp; you'd look nice as a drawstring lamp\," a reference to the lampshades Nazi concentration camp guards made from human skin). The pace speeds up as it approaches the last iteration of the chorus\, closing with a repeated chord sequence accompanied by a final burst of explosive drum.  Cover versions  Blue Ribbon Glee Club\, a large acapella group from Chicago\, regularly perform their version of the song. They have also released a video of a live show of the Dead Kennedy's in which they have replaced the audio track with a recording of their cover.  In the 1990s\, the song was updated by The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy. They replaced references to Jerry Brown with references to Pete Wilson.  The song was also widely known in Poland (as "Kalifornia Ponad Wszystko") thanks to the cover by Polish rocker Kazik Staszewski with his band Kazik Na Żywo ("Na Żywo Ale W Studio" album\, 1994).  The band Hasidic New Wave perform a remake of the song on their 1999 album\, Kabalogy. In their version\, titled "Giuliani Über Alles"\, Jerry Brown is replaced by former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani.  The Delgados cover the song in their Peel Sessions CD set.  Six Feet Under do a cover the song on their Graveyard Classics album.  The black metal band Mayhem also covered the song.  Deceased covered the song on their punk covers album "Rotten to the Core".  Current hardcore band Ceremony has covered the song.  The Who Boys have done a mashup of "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" by Gil Scott-Heron called "Revolution Über Alles".  John Linnell and his band The Statesmen covered it live at least once during his "State Songs" tour\, choosing to perform it because it mentioned the state of California.  Dramarama has recorded a version\, updated in 2003 about current California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger... "You will lift weights in school".  A 1986 live recording focused on Ronald Reagan on the album "Mutiny On The Bay" with live recordings from '82 and '86.  Jayne County covered the song with She Wolves about California's Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The green vinyl single was released under artist name Jayne County Meets The She Wolves by the German label Trash 2001  Mexican death metal band Brujería covers Dead Kennedys with the song "California Uber Aztlan" in 2010.	1

"Now look at them Dodos" -- that's the way they view us They say that Christians are a dead species Then they worship -- macroevolution Monkeys for uncles in your history Now\, that ain't workin' -- after we refute it  Then they tell you -- the Bible's dumb Maybe then your sister was a ring-tailed lemur Maybe then a lizard was your mum They've got to insult us to sway others Because they're missin' the missin' links They've got to lose the Originator They've got to prove these other theories  That little maggot with the earwig and the stinkbug  They're buggies\, but listen here  That little maggot could become an X-man That little maggot needs a billion years  They've got to insult us to sway others Because they're missin' the missin' links They've got to use their imaginations They've got to prove these other theories  Sure they mean well ... Huh?  They've got to insult us to sway others Because they're missin' the missin' links Get God removed from the situation They've got to prove these other theories  They should've learned they're playin' with fire They could get burned\, but they get numb Look at that drama they got from trickin' us with Java Man  Ain't that guy handsome? And what's up with that? Who's that? Why's that annoy us? There ain't no right and wrong -- we're like the chimpanzees Oh\, that ain't workin' -- macroevolution Monkeys for uncles in your history  Listen up  Oh\, that ain't workin' -- that's the way I view it I beg to differ on your empty theory That ain't workin' -- that's no way to prove it Get your monkeys for uncles in your history Monkeys for uncles -- history Monkeys for uncles -- missing links  I want my\, I want my\, I want my missing links I want my\, I want my\, I want my missing links  Romans 1:21 For although they knew God\, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him\, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened.	0

COL title VAL The Cristal Ship COL performer VAL Sweet Little Band	COL video title VAL NASHVILLE WEST (ft. Clarence White) - "Mental Revenge" - 1967 COL channel name VAL BobSeger1981 COL description VAL Nashville West included: Clarence White (Byrds)\, Gene Parsons\, Gib Guibeau and Wayne Moore. This is from the 1967\, self-titled\, album.  There are a few records that can be considered birthplaces of what has become known as "country-rock." Two Gene Clark albums\, Echoes and Fantastic Expedition\, come to mind\, as well as the Byrds' Sweetheart of the Rodeo and the International Submarine Band's debut. Add to that list -- and put it high up there -- Nashville West\, a self-titled debut by a group that consisted of Gib Guilbeau\, Wayne Moss\, and two future Byrds\, Gene Parsons and the great Clarence White\, and it's White's awesome guitar work that puts this album in a legendary context. Aside from the revolutionary playing by White\, the group has a forceful yet laid-back groove that\, if you like it on the first cut\, "Nashville West\," will have you digging the whole record. Parsons' drumming has a slightly soulful edge\, which predates the Flying Burrito Brothers' experiments by several years. One of the best cuts on the album is a cover of "Ode to Billy Joe\," which has White and Parsons laying into a groove that is indescribably delicious. Ignoring the historical value of this CD\, the whole record is a hell of a lot of fun.  Vocally\, not really what you'd call a masterpiece\, but it doesn't matter -- Nashville West is a record that should be owned by any fan of the Byrds\, the Flying Burrito Brothers\, Dillard & Clark\, and country music as a genre. Brilliant. ~ Matthew Greenwald	0
COL title VAL Pompeii COL performer VAL Eclipse 6	COL video title VAL Doug Sahm - Buzz buzz buzz COL channel name VAL DangerousDaveRR COL description VAL "Buzz buzz buzz" - many a great single was little more than a few nonsense words cobbled together. This single from the Hollywood Flames in '57 is a great example. And Doug and the boys give it a suitably rip-snorting treatment.  Doug Sahm was an artist who displayed a remarkable capacity for soaking up a wide variety of genres of popular music and demonstrating expertise in such genres\, often within one album.  Outside of a core set of enthusiastic admirers it is just this ability not to be typecast that may well have hampered his acceptance within the wider public domain. Relatively late in his career he recorded a small number of albums which concentrated on one genre or era of music. "Juke Box Music" is one of those albums. It focuses on music that was popular in the Southern US in the fifties. Much of this comes under the broad headings of R&B or doo-wop. The concept of the album is of a jukebox in that timeframe stacked to the gills with great music to dance or smooch to. Doug assembled an ace big band to interpret this music containing many musicians who'd been part of his various ventures in the past.  The main musicians appearing on the album are:  Doug Sahm - Vocals\, Piano & Guitar Rocky Morales - Tenor Sax Charlie McBurney - Trumpet Jack Barber - Bass George Rains - Drums  Addition musicians include:  Wayne Bennett - Guitar Derek O'Brien - Rhythm Guitar Mel Brown - Keyboards Reese Wynans - Keyboards Randy Garibay - Vocal duet Angela Strehli - Background vocals  Produced by George Rains Arrangements by Doug Sahm	0

Join our Youtube: https://goo.gl/8AOGaN Join our Facebook: http://goo.gl/5oL723 Bob Dylan (/ˈdɪlən/; born Robert Allen Zimmerman\, May 24\, 1941) is an American singer-songwriter\, artist\, and writer. He has been an influential figure in popular music and culture for more than five decades. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s\, when he was both a chronicler and a reluctant figurehead of social unrest. A number of Dylan's early songs\, such as "Blowin' in the Wind" and "The Times They Are a-Changin'"\, became anthems for the American civil rights and anti-war movements. Leaving behind his initial base in the culture of the folk music revival\, Dylan's six-minute single "Like a Rolling Stone" radically altered the parameters of popular music in 1965. His mid-1960s recordings\, backed by rock musicians\, reached the top end of the United States music charts while also attracting denunciation and criticism from others in the folk movement.

If the lyrics sound familiar\, it's because this is actually a partial cover (?) to Head Like A Hole by Nine Inch Nails. The melody is different.  I modified the lyrics for this video from http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/2508/ and the beautiful picture is from http://snakeplaya24.deviantart.com/art/space-67540954.

COL title VAL Lucifer Sam COL performer VAL Lightning Seeds	COL video title VAL Jessica Williams - Green Chimneys (T.Monk) COL channel name VAL André Rodrigues Pereira da Silva COL description VAL Review from allmusic:  «Recorded at a special afternoon series sponsored by Chemekata College in Oregon\, Jazz in the Afternoon is a trio date\, with Williams joined by Dave Captein on bass and Mel Brown on drums. The recording is surprisingly dense however\, with Williams spraying notes all over on her solo for the Monk tune "Green Chimneys" which opens the set. Captein and Brown both sound enthused by the sprightly playing and keep up the pace admirably. Williams changes directions often\, moving with a smooth grace from the stately "Light Blue" (another Monk piece) to a barreling "Straight\, No Chaser" (ditto\, obviously) to Gershwin's playful "Swanee." Her playing never falters throughout the 70-minute recording. Though Williams recorded several excellent live albums\, Jazz in the Afternoon is another great addition to her discography. »	0

Join our Youtube: https://goo.gl/8AOGaN Join our Facebook: http://goo.gl/5oL723 Bob Dylan (/ˈdɪlən/; born Robert Allen Zimmerman\, May 24\, 1941) is an American singer-songwriter\, artist\, and writer. He has been an influential figure in popular music and culture for more than five decades. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s\, when he was both a chronicler and a reluctant figurehead of social unrest. A number of Dylan's early songs\, such as "Blowin' in the Wind" and "The Times They Are a-Changin'"\, became anthems for the American civil rights and anti-war movements. Leaving behind his initial base in the culture of the folk music revival\, Dylan's six-minute single "Like a Rolling Stone" radically altered the parameters of popular music in 1965. His mid-1960s recordings\, backed by rock musicians\, reached the top end of the United States music charts while also attracting denunciation and criticism from others in the folk movement.

Tudo dará certo sha na na na na na.... Sha na na na na na na na... Agora simplesmente me abrace forte  Cante para mim mamãe (mama mama ma) Cante isso doce e claro\, oh! Mamãe me deixa ouvir aquela velha canção rock and roll  Nós fizemos isto nos dias solitários Mas\, Deus\, as noites eram longas ! E nós sonharíamos com momentos melhores Quando a mamãe cantou a canção dela Agora eu não posso recordar as palavras de forma alguma Não faz sentido tentar Porque eu simplesmente soube que muito amor veio através Daquela canção rock and roll  E ela iria cantar sha na na na nana Vai dar tudo certo Sha na na na nana Agora apenas segure firme  Eu posso ouvir você mama (mama mama ma) nada afrouxa minha alma como o som da canção de ninar bom velho rock and roll.	1

This is our interpretation of XTCs atheistic song 'Dear God'\, an awesome some with a great message - 'religion is silly'. Ever since first hearing it we've been wanting to cover it and it seemed to be begging for the metal treatment!  Our version appears on our EP 'Watch It Burn' as part of the paid content. Both the free EP and the paid versions are available from our site: http://www.shiftband.net  When we play covers we like to put our own stamp on them and change things around a bit rather than just play a straight copy\, so hopefully we've captured the essence of the song and done it justice\, but keep that in mind when listening.	0

Luister zonder advertenties met YouTube Premium  Rotterdams mondorgeltrio rond Geert van Driesten. Ze beleven hun hoogtijdagen in de jaren vijftig en begin jaren zestig\, met als hoogtepunt het optreden in de show van Dorus 1935 - 1945 Geert van Driesten richt\, geïnspireerd door de Amerikaanse mondharpgroep Borrah Minevitch & his Harmonica Rascals\, The 5 Hotcha's (Mexicaans voor 'muzikale zwerver') op. Aanvankelijk spelen ze veel in Engeland\, met de beroemde band van Jack Hylton. Ook spelen de Hotcha's tot de oorlog in Parijs\, Brussel en verschillende steden in Duitsland.   1945 - 1950 Minevitch vraagt Driesten om naar Amerika te komen. Driesten bedankt voor de eer en in plaats daarvan richt hij de Eerste Nederlandse Chromatische Mondharmonica School op. Driesten stelt zich ten doel om\, met behulp van deze school in Rotterdam\, de mondharp als serieus concertinstrument geaccepteerd te krijgen. Daarnaast is hij nog steeds de voorman van de Hotcha's\, inmiddels teruggebracht tot Hotcha Trio met Eddy Sernee en Joop Heijman. Met hun clowneske show en allerhande idioterie groeit de faam van het Hotcha Trio gestaag.  1950 - 1960 In 1951 neemt het Hotcha Trio hun eerste plaatje op: een 78-toerenplaat met het lied Honeysuckle Rose en op de B-kant Chattanoogie Shoe Shine Boy. Sernee heeft inmiddels plaatsgemaakt voor Henk van Dipte\, die akkoorden speelt op de 'rol' (acht tot een cilinder samengeklonken harmonica's in verschillende toonsoorten). Driesten speelt op de basharmonica en Heijman is de solist. De swingende\, energieke liedjes van de Hotcha's weten een alsmaar groeiend publiek aan te spreken. Het trio komt veelvuldig op de radio en later ook op televisie in de show van Dorus.  1960 - 1970 De eerste jaren van de jaren zestig is het Hotcha Trio nog steeds erg populair. Het repertoire van het trio verandert echter onder de druk van de oprukkende beatmuziek: de jazz van liedjes als Honeysuckle Rose heeft plaatsgemaakt voor meedeiners als Der Onkel Jonathan en De Zilvervloot. Het variété-tijdperk is zo langzamerhand afgelopen\, de tijdgeest is veranderd en de populariteit van de Hotcha's neemt razendsnel af. Een bijkomend probleem is dat de akkoordenspelers nooit lang trouw blijven aan het trio: na Van Dipte volgen achtereenvolgens Lee Kuipers\, Gijs van der Wiel\, Jan Vuik en Frans Pauli. In 1970 besluit Van Driesten in stilte om een punt te zetten achter de ooit zo glansrijke carrière van het Hotcha Trio.	0

This song was a #1 hit for Ernest Hare and Billy Jones in 1921. Original Billboard review: "Carr turns in a real zingy coverage of the sleeper piano instrumental revival which has hit via Del Wood's reading on Tennessee label. Similar to the original and could catch a piece. Rated 81 out of 100".  Written by L. Wolfe Gilbert.   B-side is "Ivory Rag" by Joe "Fingers" Carr and the Carr-Hops.	0

Hurt)  Recorded: New York City\, December 28\,1928 Mississippi John Hurt (vcl)(g).  Born John Smith Hurt in Teoc\,  Carroll County\, Mississippi and raised in Avalon\, Mississippi\, Hurt learned to play guitar at age 9. He spent much of his youth playing old time music for friends and dances\, earning a living as a farm hand into the 1920s. In 1923 he partnered with the fiddle player Willie Narmour as a substitute for his regular partner Shell Smith. When Narmour got a chance to record for Okeh Records as a prize for winning first place in a 1928 fiddle contest\, Narmour recommended John Hurt to Okeh Records producer Tommy Rockwell. After auditioning "Monday Morning Blues" at his home\, he took part in two recording sessions\, in Memphis and New York City (see Discography below). The "Mississippi" tag was added by Okeh as a sales gimmick. After the commercial failure of the resulting records\, and Okeh Records going out of business during the Great Depression\, Hurt returned to Avalon and obscurity\, working as a sharecropper and playing local parties and dances.  In 1963\, however\, a folk musicologist\, Tom Hoskins\, inspired by the recordings\, was able to locate Hurt near Avalon\, Mississippi. Seeing that Hurt's guitar playing skills were still intact\, Hoskins encouraged him to move to Washington\, D.C.\, and begin performing on a wider stage. His performance at the 1964 Newport Folk Festival saw his star rise amongst the new folk revival audience. Before his death he played extensively in colleges\, concert halls\, coffee houses and also on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson\, as well as recording three further albums for Vanguard Records. The numbers his devotees particularly liked were the ragtime songs "Salty Dog" and "Candy Man"\, and the blues ballads "Spike Driver Blues" (a variant of "John Henry") and "Frankie".  Hurt's influence spanned several music genres including blues\, country\, bluegrass\, folk and contemporary rock and roll. A soft-spoken man\, his nature was reflected in the work\, which remained a mellow mix of country\, blues and old time music to the end.[7]  Hurt died in November 1966 from a heart attack in Grenada\, Mississippi	0

Between 1968 and 1970 a number of other singers had significant hits with her songs: The 5th Dimension with "Blowing Away"\, "Wedding Bell Blues"\, "Stoned Soul Picnic"\, "Sweet Blindness"\, "Save The Country" and "Black Patch"; Blood\, Sweat & Tears and Peter\, Paul & Mary with "And When I Die"; Three Dog Night with "Eli's Coming"; and Barbra Streisand with "Stoney End"\, "Time and Love"\, and "Hands off the Man (Flim Flam Man)". Nyro's best-selling single was her recording of Carole King and Gerry Goffin's "Up on the Roof."   Lyrics:  Loving you so I was too blind to see you letting me go But now that you've set me free It's gonna take a miracle Yes\, it's gonna take a miracle To make me love someone new Cause I'm crazy for you  Oh oh\, didn't you know It wouldn't be so easy lettin' you go I could have told you that it's gonna take a miracle  oh-uh Yes\, it's gonna take a miracle To make me love someone new Cause I'm crazy for you  Oh\, tho' I know I can't forget? about you or come so? will show you how much You're turning me around\, destroying me I'll never be the same anymore  You must realize You took your love and left me Quite by surprise You can be sure that now it's gonna take a miracle Yes\, it's gonna take a miracle To make me love someone new Cause I'm crazy for you	0

COL title VAL Let It Go COL performer VAL Brooklyn Duo	COL video title VAL Los Tiki Phantoms - Kalifornia (California Über Alles - Dead Kennedys Surf Cover) COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven COL description VAL http://www.facebook.com/lostikifans  From '' Regresan De La Tumba '' Label: B-Core Disc -- B-CORE-143 Format: CD\, Album Country: Spain Released: 17 Nov 2006  Tracklist 01. Regresan de la tumba 02. Heavy surfer 03. Biarritz 04. El pulpo 05. Mundaka 06. Kilahuea 07. Vulcan 08. Spaguetti 09. Satan's 10. Guatiki 11. Ojos verdes 12. Kalifornia  ------------------------  "California Über Alles" was the first single by the Dead Kennedys.  The record was released in June 1979 on Optional Music with "The Man with the Dogs" as the b-side. The title track was re-recorded for the band's first album\, Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables (1980)\, and the version that appeared on this single\, as well as the single's b-side\, are available on the rarities album Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death (1987).  The lyrics were written by Jello Biafra and John Greenway\, and Biafra composed the music in one of his rare attempts at composing on bass.  This song was featured in the video game Tony Hawk's American Wasteland and as a downloadable song in the Rock Band series. It is also sampled in a song by the Dance-Punk/Big beat trio The Prodigy\, "Dead Ken Beats".  The song was also featured in the 2010 film\, The Social Network.  Meaning  The title is an allusion to the first (and no longer sung) stanza of the national anthem of Germany\, which begins with the words "Deutschland\, Deutschland über alles." (literally\, "Germany\, Germany above all.")  The song focuses on Jerry Brown\, the Governor of California 1975-1983 and 2011--present\, and is sung from his perspective. An imaginary Brown outlines a hippie-fascist vision for America\, in which his "suede denim secret police" kill un-cool people with "organic poison gas" chambers. Lines such as "Serpent's egg already hatched" (a reference to a line from William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar) comment on the corrosive nature of power. The line "now it is 1984" refers to the totalitarian regime of George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four\, describing a future (from 1979) where Jerry Brown has become President Brown presiding over secret police and gas chambers.  The song is an early example of the Kennedys' trademark use of menace and musical tension. It fades in with sinister military-styled drums\, joined by an ominous bass riff. Biafra paints the scene in low\, sneering tones before bursting in manic chanting chorus: "California Über Alles [x2]\, Über Alles\, California [x2]". After two verses and choruses\, the song shifts into a slower middle eight section set to a martial drum beat over which Jello Biafra imagines the nightmarish actions of Brown's SS-styled secret police ("Come quietly to the camp; you'd look nice as a drawstring lamp\," a reference to the lampshades Nazi concentration camp guards made from human skin). The pace speeds up as it approaches the last iteration of the chorus\, closing with a repeated chord sequence accompanied by a final burst of explosive drum.  Cover versions  Blue Ribbon Glee Club\, a large acapella group from Chicago\, regularly perform their version of the song. They have also released a video of a live show of the Dead Kennedy's in which they have replaced the audio track with a recording of their cover.  In the 1990s\, the song was updated by The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy. They replaced references to Jerry Brown with references to Pete Wilson.  The song was also widely known in Poland (as "Kalifornia Ponad Wszystko") thanks to the cover by Polish rocker Kazik Staszewski with his band Kazik Na Żywo ("Na Żywo Ale W Studio" album\, 1994).  The band Hasidic New Wave perform a remake of the song on their 1999 album\, Kabalogy. In their version\, titled "Giuliani Über Alles"\, Jerry Brown is replaced by former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani.  The Delgados cover the song in their Peel Sessions CD set.  Six Feet Under do a cover the song on their Graveyard Classics album.  The black metal band Mayhem also covered the song.  Deceased covered the song on their punk covers album "Rotten to the Core".  Current hardcore band Ceremony has covered the song.  The Who Boys have done a mashup of "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" by Gil Scott-Heron called "Revolution Über Alles".  John Linnell and his band The Statesmen covered it live at least once during his "State Songs" tour\, choosing to perform it because it mentioned the state of California.  Dramarama has recorded a version\, updated in 2003 about current California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger... "You will lift weights in school".  A 1986 live recording focused on Ronald Reagan on the album "Mutiny On The Bay" with live recordings from '82 and '86.  Jayne County covered the song with She Wolves about California's Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The green vinyl single was released under artist name Jayne County Meets The She Wolves by the German label Trash 2001  Mexican death metal band Brujería covers Dead Kennedys with the song "California Uber Aztlan" in 2010.	0

COL channel name VAL SixtiesOnly COL description VAL The Walker Brothers were an American pop group of the 1960s and 1970s\, comprising Scott Engel (eventually known professionally as Scott Walker)\, John Walker (born John Maus\, but using the name Walker since his teens)\, and Gary Leeds (eventually known as Gary Walker). After moving to Britain in 1965\, they had a number of top ten albums and singles there\, including the No. 1 chart hits "Make It Easy on Yourself" and "The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine (Anymore)\," both of which also made the US top 20.  Formed in 1964\, they adopted the 'Walker Brothers' name even though the members are all unrelated as a show business touch—"simply because we liked it." They provided a unique counterpoint to the British Invasion in that they were a group from the United States that achieved much more success in the United Kingdom than in their home country\, during the period when the popularity of British bands such as The Beatles dominated the US.	0

Released as a single in May 1970 (backed by the non-album track "Magic Mountain")\, it was War's first chart hit\, peaking at number three. It was also a top three hit in Canada and Australia. It charted #15 in Netherlands and #28 in Germany.  In 1996\, it was remixed by Junior Vasquez and released as a single again.  Lonnie Jordan said in an 2008 interview that Eric Burdon is the first Latin rapper in pop music.  In the introduction to the live version of the song on Greatest Hits Live\, Lonnie Jordan reveals that the inspiration for the song was a time when he spilled a glass of wine on a mixing board in the recording studio. Eric Burdon found the event funny\, so he and Jordan used it as the inspiration for the song.  Use in film  "Spill the Wine" was used in the popular motion pictures Boogie Nights\, Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo and Remember the Titans.  It was also sung during the The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air episode\, "That's No Lady\, That's My Cousin".  The song can also be heard in the Dexter episode "A Horse of a Different Color"\, while main characters Joey Quinn and Angel Batista are smoking a joint.  Cover versions  The song has been covered by: The Isley Brothers for their 1971 album Givin' It All Back\, as well as by The B-Side Players\, Juan Ma y su Sonido Costeño\, 2NU on their 1989 album Ponderous\, Lalo Schifrin\, Melvin Sparks\, Michael Hutchence\, The Dream Syndicate\, Lighter Shade of Brown\, Los Mocosos and Freaked Out Flower Children.  In 2004\, flautist Alexander Zonjic performed a cover for his album "Seldom Blues."  In 2012\, the revival of the 1970's band The L.A. Carpool\, covered Spill the Wine with a Latin salsa flare. The cover features well known Latin drummer Richie "Gajate" Garcia among many other well known Latin musicians.	1

In June 1987 Gerald Arthur Friend picked up a 14-year-old female friend after leaving a concert at the Tacoma Dome. Upon trying to exit the car the girl was handcuffed and held hostage at knife point. The girl was taken to a mobile home where she was tortured and raped with various objects for two days. She was also threatened with a blowtorch."  we recorded our cover of "polly" for SPIN magazine's "Newermind" tribute/compilation to mark the 20th anniversary of "Nevermind" in september. michael (who a lot of you have seen as the new drummer of my touring band\, the grand theft orchestra) produced/engineered and played bass on the recording.  this is a video me (glockenspiel\, vocals\, Taurus bass pedal)\, chad raines (banjo\, percussion)\, and michael (bass\, percussion) shot in new haven\, CT on a super-tight budget with the help of some actors and filmmakers from around new york and yale.   we filmed it in one day in november...i wrote the script and michael directed the video. blake\, who plays the angel\, is also on the cover of the first dolls' album "a is for accident"...looking very different in a long red dress.  so many people loaned us stuff and worked for free on this video to keep us under budget - THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH.  x afp ________________  FULL CREDITS & THANK YOUS...  song by NIRVANA  starring CHRISTOPHER M.

Inez sang lead vocal\, while Charlie sang back-up and played guitar.[1]   Their most successful record was with their novelty composition\, "Mockingbird". Released in 1963\, it made the Top 10 on both the rhythm and blues and pop charts; the song was later covered by artists including Aretha Franklin\, James Taylor\, Carly Simon\, Dusty Springfield and Toby Keith. Other notable recordings were "Hurt by Love\," "Ask Me\," and "(1-2-3-4-5-6-7) Count the Days."   They were known for their exciting live performances\, of which a highlight was Inez's rendition of "I Stand Accused"\, which finished with a supposedly distraught Inez singing the last verse\, while being carried offstage by Charlie. They toured extensively in Europe and their music played a key role in the development of the Northern Soul movement.   Inez also had some success recording on her own\, beginning in 1969\, but her popularity faded in the 1970s. Charlie was already working as a record producer when they finally disbanded their act.   Inez Foxx was married to the American songwriter and producer Luther Dixon. Together they wrote\, and he produced\, The Platters' mid-1960s return to hit-making with the single "I Love You 1000 Times".[2] Luther Dixon produced Inez and Charlie's 1967 album Come By Here\, but the couple later divorced.[2]   Charlie Foxx died from leukemia in 1998\, at the age of 58.	1

Smokin' Piano !! Maria Muldaur was part of the American folk music revival in the early 1960s. She recorded the 1974 hit song "Midnight at the Oasis\," and continues to record albums in the folk traditions. Around this time\, Muldaur established a relationship with the Grateful Dead\, opening for some of their shows in the summer of 1974 with John Kahn\, bassist of the Jerry Garcia Band\, which would eventually earn her a seat in that group as a backing vocalist in the late 1970s. She appeared on Super Jam (1989)\, the live recording of the German TV series Villa Fantastica with Brian Auger on piano\, Pete York on drums\, Dick Morrissey on tenor saxophone\, Roy Williams on trombone\, Harvey Weston on bass and Zoot Money\, also on vocals. Her 2005 release Sweet Lovin' Ol' Soul was nominated for both a Blues Music Award (formerly a W.C. Handy Award) and a Grammy Award in the Traditional Blues Category.

COL title VAL My Immortal COL performer VAL Julia Westlin	COL video title VAL Red Foley Hang Your Head In Shame COL channel name VAL Marcus Brazil COL description VAL Foley was an inspiration to rock 'n' roll\, in particular Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley\, who both covered many of his songs. His country boogie material was a clear precursor of the style.  Foley has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: one for his recording career at\, 6225 Hollywood Blvd. and one for his television career\, at 6300 Hollywood Blvd. On June 10\, 2003\, a Kentucky State historical marker (No. 2114) was placed at Foley's boyhood home in Berea.  In 2002\, he was inducted into the Kentucky Music Hall of Fame\, where his corncob pipe is on display. In 2006\, his 1951 version of "Peace in the Valley" was entered into the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry.  In 1970\, Berea College established the Red Foley Memorial Music Award. Initiated by his long-time friend and colleague Si Siman\, the annual award is presented to talented Berea College students in recognition of their musical contributions to the campus community. It is intended to promote the music associated with Foley’s career\, such as folk\, country\, bluegrass\, gospel and popular music.  A dance to Foley's song\, "The Salty Dog Rag"\, has been traditional at Dartmouth College since 1972\, where it is taught to freshman during orientation.[21][22] Cumberland Falls State Park\, in Corbin\, Kentucky\, near Foley's hometown of Berea\, has been playing the song with an accompanying dance at its square dance nights since at least the mid-1970s.  The Rooks Van Dellen Residence Hall at Calvin College has an annual celebration of Red Foley Day in mid-November. The celebration began in 1968 when a few students from the hall heard a radio announcer say\, "Red Foley was a great country music singer\, too bad no one will ever remember him." The day has been celebrated (with a few lapses) to remember Foley ever since.[23][24]  Foley Middle School\, located in Berea near Foley's boyhood home\, opened in 1978 and educates students in southern Madison County in the 6th\, 7th\, and 8th grades. The school retains a large collection of personal items once owned by Foley on display in the library. The collection was donated by members of his family.  Red Foley Court is among several streets in Nixa\, Missouri named for performers on Ozark Jubilee\, and Red Foley Road is in Rockcastle County\, Kentucky\, north of Renfro Valley.[25]  In 2009\, singer/songwriter James Power released a song based on Foley's second wife\, Eva Overstake (aka Judy Martin)\, entitled "A Cowgirl's Suicide" on YouTube.[26] The song was featured in the independent film Laid Off by director John Launchi.	0

Join our Youtube: https://goo.gl/8AOGaN Join our Facebook: http://goo.gl/5oL723  Nathaniel Adams Coles (March 17\, 1919 – February 15\, 1965)\, known professionally as Nat King Cole\, was an American singer who first came to prominence as a leading jazz pianist. He was widely noted for his soft baritone voice\, performing in big band and jazz genres\, and was a major force in popular music for three decades. Cole was one of the first African Americans to host a national television variety show\, The Nat King Cole Show. His recordings remained popular worldwide after his death from lung cancer in February 1965. Nathaniel Adams Coles was born in Montgomery\, Alabama\, on March 17\, 1919. He had three brothers—Eddie (1910–1970)\, Ike (1927–2001)\, and Freddy (born 1931)—and a half-sister\, Joyce Coles. Each of his brothers pursued careers in music. When Nat was four years old\, he and his family moved to Chicago\, Illinois\, where his father\, Edward Coles\, became a Baptist minister. Nat learned to play the organ from his mother\, Perlina Coles\, the church organist. His first performance was of "Yes! We Have No Bananas" at the age of four. He began formal lessons at 12 and eventually learned not only jazz and gospel music but also Western classical music; he performed "from Johann Sebastian Bach to Sergei Rachmaninoff." Inspired by the performances of Hines\, Cole began his performing career in the mid-1930s while still a teenager\, adopting the name Nat Cole. His older brother\, Eddie\, a bass player\, soon joined Cole's band\, and they made their first recording in 1936\, under Eddie's name. They also were regular performers in clubs. Cole acquired his nickname\, "King"\, performing at one jazz club\, a nickname presumably reinforced by the otherwise unrelated nursery rhyme about Old King Cole. He was also a pianist in a national tour of Eubie Blake's revue\, Shuffle Along. When it suddenly failed in Long Beach\, California\, Cole decided to remain there. He later returned to Chicago in triumph to play such venues as the Edgewater Beach Hotel. Cole and two other musicians formed the "King Cole Swingsters" in Long Beach and played in a number of local bars before getting a gig on the Long Beach Pike for US $90.00 per week ($1\,535 in 2015). The trio consisted of Cole on piano\, Oscar Moore on guitar\, and Wesley Prince on double bass. The trio played in Failsworth through the late 1930s and recorded many radio transcriptions for Capitol Transcriptions. Cole was the pianist and also the leader of the combo. Radio was important to the King Cole Trio's rise in popularity. Their first broadcast was with NBC's Blue Network in 1938. It was followed by performances on NBC's Swing Soiree. In the 1940s\, the trio appeared on the radio shows Old Gold\, The Chesterfield Supper Club and Kraft Music Hall. The King Cole Trio performed twice on CBS Radio's variety show The Orson Welles Almanac in 1944. Cole was inducted into the Alabama Music Hall of Fame and the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame. He was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1990. He was inducted into the Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame in 1997 and the Hit Parade Hall of Fame in 2007. A United States postage stamp featuring Cole's likeness was issued in 1994. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000\, as a major influence on early rock and roll\, and the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2013\, for his contribution to Latin music. Cole's success at Capitol Records\, for which he recorded more than 150 singles that reached the Billboard Pop\, R&B\, and Country charts\, has yet to be matched by any Capitol artist. his records sold 50 million copies during his career. His recording of "The Christmas Song" still receives airplay every holiday season. FROM WIKIPEDIA: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_King_Cole	0

In June 1987 Gerald Arthur Friend picked up a 14-year-old female friend after leaving a concert at the Tacoma Dome. Upon trying to exit the car the girl was handcuffed and held hostage at knife point. The girl was taken to a mobile home where she was tortured and raped with various objects for two days. She was also threatened with a blowtorch."  we recorded our cover of "polly" for SPIN magazine's "Newermind" tribute/compilation to mark the 20th anniversary of "Nevermind" in september. michael (who a lot of you have seen as the new drummer of my touring band\, the grand theft orchestra) produced/engineered and played bass on the recording.  this is a video me (glockenspiel\, vocals\, Taurus bass pedal)\, chad raines (banjo\, percussion)\, and michael (bass\, percussion) shot in new haven\, CT on a super-tight budget with the help of some actors and filmmakers from around new york and yale.   we filmed it in one day in november...i wrote the script and michael directed the video. blake\, who plays the angel\, is also on the cover of the first dolls' album "a is for accident"...looking very different in a long red dress.  so many people loaned us stuff and worked for free on this video to keep us under budget - THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH.  x afp ________________  FULL CREDITS & THANK YOUS...  song by NIRVANA  starring CHRISTOPHER M.

Kalifornia  ------------------------  "California Über Alles" was the first single by the Dead Kennedys.  The record was released in June 1979 on Optional Music with "The Man with the Dogs" as the b-side. The title track was re-recorded for the band's first album\, Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables (1980)\, and the version that appeared on this single\, as well as the single's b-side\, are available on the rarities album Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death (1987).  The lyrics were written by Jello Biafra and John Greenway\, and Biafra composed the music in one of his rare attempts at composing on bass.  This song was featured in the video game Tony Hawk's American Wasteland and as a downloadable song in the Rock Band series. It is also sampled in a song by the Dance-Punk/Big beat trio The Prodigy\, "Dead Ken Beats".  The song was also featured in the 2010 film\, The Social Network.  Meaning  The title is an allusion to the first (and no longer sung) stanza of the national anthem of Germany\, which begins with the words "Deutschland\, Deutschland über alles." (literally\, "Germany\, Germany above all.")  The song focuses on Jerry Brown\, the Governor of California 1975-1983 and 2011--present\, and is sung from his perspective. An imaginary Brown outlines a hippie-fascist vision for America\, in which his "suede denim secret police" kill un-cool people with "organic poison gas" chambers. Lines such as "Serpent's egg already hatched" (a reference to a line from William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar) comment on the corrosive nature of power. The line "now it is 1984" refers to the totalitarian regime of George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four\, describing a future (from 1979) where Jerry Brown has become President Brown presiding over secret police and gas chambers.  The song is an early example of the Kennedys' trademark use of menace and musical tension. It fades in with sinister military-styled drums\, joined by an ominous bass riff. Biafra paints the scene in low\, sneering tones before bursting in manic chanting chorus: "California Über Alles [x2]\, Über Alles\, California [x2]". After two verses and choruses\, the song shifts into a slower middle eight section set to a martial drum beat over which Jello Biafra imagines the nightmarish actions of Brown's SS-styled secret police ("Come quietly to the camp; you'd look nice as a drawstring lamp\," a reference to the lampshades Nazi concentration camp guards made from human skin). The pace speeds up as it approaches the last iteration of the chorus\, closing with a repeated chord sequence accompanied by a final burst of explosive drum.  Cover versions  Blue Ribbon Glee Club\, a large acapella group from Chicago\, regularly perform their version of the song. They have also released a video of a live show of the Dead Kennedy's in which they have replaced the audio track with a recording of their cover.  In the 1990s\, the song was updated by The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy. They replaced references to Jerry Brown with references to Pete Wilson.  The song was also widely known in Poland (as "Kalifornia Ponad Wszystko") thanks to the cover by Polish rocker Kazik Staszewski with his band Kazik Na Żywo ("Na Żywo Ale W Studio" album\, 1994).  The band Hasidic New Wave perform a remake of the song on their 1999 album\, Kabalogy. In their version\, titled "Giuliani Über Alles"\, Jerry Brown is replaced by former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani.  The Delgados cover the song in their Peel Sessions CD set.  Six Feet Under do a cover the song on their Graveyard Classics album.  The black metal band Mayhem also covered the song.  Deceased covered the song on their punk covers album "Rotten to the Core".  Current hardcore band Ceremony has covered the song.  The Who Boys have done a mashup of "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" by Gil Scott-Heron called "Revolution Über Alles".  John Linnell and his band The Statesmen covered it live at least once during his "State Songs" tour\, choosing to perform it because it mentioned the state of California.  Dramarama has recorded a version\, updated in 2003 about current California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger... "You will lift weights in school".  A 1986 live recording focused on Ronald Reagan on the album "Mutiny On The Bay" with live recordings from '82 and '86.  Jayne County covered the song with She Wolves about California's Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The green vinyl single was released under artist name Jayne County Meets The She Wolves by the German label Trash 2001  Mexican death metal band Brujería covers Dead Kennedys with the song "California Uber Aztlan" in 2010.	0

Hear the pipes are calling\, Loudly and proudly calling\, Down thro' the glen. There where the hills are sleeping\, Now feel the blood a-leaping\, High as the spirits of the old Highland men.  Towering in gallant fame\, Scotland my mountain hame\, High may your proud standards gloriously wave\, Land of my high endeavour\, Land of the shining river\, Land of my heart for ever\, Scotland the brave.  High in the misty Highlands\, Out by the purple islands\, Brave are the hearts that beat Beneath Scottish skies. Wild are the winds to meet you\, Staunch are the friends that greet you\, Kind as the love that shines from fair maiden's eyes.  Towering in gallant fame\, Scotland my mountain hame\, High may your proud standards gloriously wave\, Land of my high endeavour\, Land of the shining river\, Land of my heart for ever\, Scotland the brave.  Far off in sunlit places\, Sad are the Scottish faces\, Yearning to feel the kiss Of sweet Scottish rain. Where tropic skies are beaming\, Love sets the heart a-dreaming\, Longing and dreaming for the homeland again.  Towering in gallant fame\, Scotland my mountain hame\, High may your proud standards gloriously wave\, Land of my high endeavour\, Land of the shining river\, Land of my heart for ever\, Scotland the brave. Land of my heart for ever\, Scotland the brave.	0

COL title VAL Pretty Girls Everywhere COL performer VAL Arthur Alexander	COL video title VAL Walker Brothers :::: Pretty Girls Everywhere. COL channel name VAL SixtiesOnly COL description VAL The Walker Brothers were an American pop group of the 1960s and 1970s\, comprising Scott Engel (eventually known professionally as Scott Walker)\, John Walker (born John Maus\, but using the name Walker since his teens)\, and Gary Leeds (eventually known as Gary Walker). After moving to Britain in 1965\, they had a number of top ten albums and singles there\, including the No. 1 chart hits "Make It Easy on Yourself" and "The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine (Anymore)\," both of which also made the US top 20.  Formed in 1964\, they adopted the 'Walker Brothers' name even though the members are all unrelated as a show business touch—"simply because we liked it." They provided a unique counterpoint to the British Invasion in that they were a group from the United States that achieved much more success in the United Kingdom than in their home country\, during the period when the popularity of British bands such as The Beatles dominated the US.	1

Johnny rosen up your pick an' play your guitar hard 'cause hell's broke loose in scunthorpe an' the devil deals the cards. Now if you win you'll get this shinny guitar made of gold\, but if you loose the devil gets your soul!  The devil opened up his case and said 'i'll start this gig' and fire flew from his finger tips as he rosened up his pick. He strummed the pick across the strings it made an evil hiss Then a band of demons joined in and it sounded somthing like this  When the devil finished Johnny said 'You're pretty good ol' son\, but sit down in that chair right there let me show you how it's done!'  Fire on the mountain run boy's run! Devil's in the house of the risen sun! Chicken in the bread pan picken out dough! Granny does your dog bite\, no child\, no!   The devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat\, and he laid that golden gitar on the ground at Johnny's feet. Johnny said 'devil just come on back if you ever want to try again\, I done told you once you son of a bitch i'm the best I've ever been!'  Fire on the mountain run boy's run! Devil's in the house of the risen sun! Chicken in the bread pan picken out dough! Granny does your dog bite\, no child\, no!	1

COL title VAL Dreams of the Everyday Housewife COL performer VAL Glen Campbell	COL video title VAL The Mar-Keys - Last Night COL channel name VAL englishnbloodyproudo COL description VAL The Mar-Keys\, formed in 1958\, were an American studio session band for the Stax label from Memphis\, Tennessee\, in the 1960s. As the first house band for the label\, their backing music formed the foundation for the early 1960s Stax sound.  The group began as The Royal Spades and had tried unsuccessfully to get a record made for the local Satellite Records even though tenor sax player Charles "Packy" Axton's mother and uncle owned that label. When they were finally able to get a record made\, Axton's mother Estelle Axton convinced the group to change their name and they chose The Mar-Keys.  They also recorded organ and saxophone oriented singles of their own\, scoring a number three hit nationally with "Last Night" in 1961. It sold over one million copies\, earning gold disc recognition. Keyboards were played by Jerry Lee "Smoochy" Smith. Other singles of theirs from the early 1960s include "Philly Dog" and "Popeye Stroll." Members of this rhythm section later formed other nationally prominent Memphis studio session groups\, including the Memphis Horns\, the Packers\, and Booker T. & the M.G.'s. Each of these offshoot groups also recorded popular instrumental albums of their own\, in addition to serving as the backing band on albums by dozens of rock\, R&B\, and soul music stars on Stax\, Volt and other national labels. The legacy of the Mar-Keys and later groups was that of having been key players in the development of soul music styles like Southern soul and Memphis soul.	0

I love the music of Clarence White & decided it was time to put some out. It's a great listen & was made as learning tapes to be given as gifts to his friends. It was found after his sudden death at age 29\, killed by a drunk driver. This was a tape\, recorded by Ry Cooder in White's home in early tape days. He was with The Byrds\, The New KY Colonels\, backed Emmylou & Gram\, Jackson Browne\, The Everly Bros\,the supergroup Muleskinner (look up the members)\, Gene Watston\,Arlo Guthrie...almost anyone who was playing good music at the time. Many believe he would have been the crossover giant in music if not for his untimely death. He steered clear of drugs & booze. Tony Rice & Marty Stuart bought 2 of his guitars due to their respect for him. Enjoy!	0

COL title VAL Yesterday Is Here COL performer VAL Bettye LaVette	COL video title VAL Юрий Гуляев - Журавли (запись 1974 года\, винил) COL channel name VAL Бешеный Карпыч COL description VAL ЖУРАВЛИ - эта настоящая великая песня Юрия Гуляева\, обречённая на вечное сравнивание. На этот раз с Марком Бернесом - её первым исполнителем\, да и по сути соучастником её создания. С тем самым Безумным Марком\, который два года выпестывал текст этой песни\, сражаясь за каждое слово... Нет\, не с поэтом Гамзатовым\, чей аварский оригинал\, в подстрочном переводе\, кстати\, очень даже хорош. Настоящий бой шёл с неуступчивым поэтом-переводчиком Наумом Гребнёвым\, вот где коса нашла на камень. Наум Гребнёв - поэт с жестокой фронтовой судьбой\, встретивший войну ещё под Брестом\, затем бои через всю Украину\, страшный харьковский котёл\, из которого он\, один из немногих\, сумел вырваться. Потом бои за Сталинград\, три ранения и прочая\, прочая\, прочая... Так что текст ЖУРАВЛЕЙ пропитан подлинным горем войны\, может поэтому эта песня оказывает такое воздействие на людей даже сегодня. Что же касается сравнения Гуляева и Бернеса в этой песне\, то хочется сказать одно - петь можно не только прямым голосом\, но и послезвучием\, остановкой\, длительностью паузы\, просто дыханием в микрофон. И сравнивая Гуляева и Бернеса в ЖУРАВЛЯХ\, приходишь к парадоксальному выводу\, что именно эти два исполнения наиболее внутренне похожи\, даже практически одинаковы. И это при всём различии вокальных техник. Поэтому\, для себя я давно решил\, здесь явная ничья. Возможно\, размер сердец у обоих певцов оказался одинаковым.

Lyrics:  Once I was seven years old my mama told me\,  Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely Once I was seven years old  It was a big\, big world but we thought we were bigger Pushing each other to the limits\, we were learning quicker By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor  Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure  Once I was eleven years old my daddy told me\,  Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely Once I was eleven years old  I always had that dream like my daddy before me So I started writing songs\, I started writing stories Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me ‘Cause only those I really love will ever really know me  Once I was twenty years old my story got told Before the morning sun when life was lonely Once I was twenty years old  I only see my goals I don't believe in failure ‘Cause I know the smallest voices they can make it major I got my boys with me\, at least those in favor And if we don't meet before I leave I hope I'll see you later  Once I was twenty years old my story got told  I waswriting 'bout everything I saw before me Once I was twenty years old  Soon we'll be thirty years old\, our songs have been sold  We'vetraveled around the world and we're still roaming Soon we'll be thirty years old  I'm still learning about life\, my woman brought children for me So I can sing them all my songs and I can tell them stories Most of my boys are with me\, some are still out seeking glory And some I had to leave behind\, my brother I'm still sorry  Soon I'll be sixty years old\, my daddy got sixty-one  Remember life and then your life becomes a better one I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month  Soon I'll be sixty years old\, will I think the world is cold Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me Soon I'll be sixty years old  #OfficialMusicVideo #LukasGraham #7Years #WeAreWarnerRecords	0

COL channel name VAL JUSTASITTINANDAROCK COL description VAL RARE OLDIES VIDEO WITH DAVE LAMBERT \, JON HENDRICKS & YOLANDA BAVAN ! The group formed in 1957 and recorded their first album Sing a Song of Basie for Paramount Records. The album featured versions of Count Basie standards and was successful enough that the Count Basie Orchestra collaborated with them on Sing Along With Basie (1959)\, which was awarded a Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 1998. Beginning in 1959\, the trio recorded three LPs with Columbia Records. Their song "Twisted\," featuring Ross's lyrics set to a Wardell Gray melody\, was featured in Woody Allen's Deconstructing Harry (1997) and has been covered by Joni Mitchell\, Bette Midler and others. Their High Flying won a Grammy Award for Best Performance by a Vocal Group in 1962. Lambert\, Hendricks & Ross were voted Best Vocal Group in the Down Beat Readers Poll from 1959 to 1963. Annie Ross left the group in 1962\, replaced by vocalist Yolande Bavan. The renamed Lambert\, Hendricks and Bavan made three live albums before disbanding in 1964. Lambert\, Hendricks and Bavan appeared at the 1962 Newport Jazz Festival\, and their performance of "Comin' Home" and "Moanin'" can be seen in Buddy Bregman's film The 1962 Newport Jazz Festival. The group was also known as Lambert\, Hendricks and Moss when Canadian jazz singer Anne Marie Moss briefly replaced Annie Ross. Any hopes of a reunion of the original trio ended with Lambert's 1966 death in a car accident. You can watch all my rare oldies soundies on : http://www.myspace.com/swingcocktail !

COL title VAL I Don't Wanna Play House COL performer VAL Billie Jo Spears	COL video title VAL Maynard Ferguson - Chameleon COL channel name VAL malawolf85 COL description VAL Walter Maynard Ferguson\, best know for his extreme high register control on trumpet\, was a Canadian jazz trumpet player and bandleader. Born in Verdun\, Quebec (now part of Montreal) Maynard by the age of four was playing piano and violin but at 9 years of age he switched to cornet. At age thirteen\, Maynard first soloed as a child prodigy with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Orchestra and was heard frequently on the CBC\, notably featured on a "Serenade for Trumpet in Jazz" written for him by Morris Davis. Maynard won a scholarship to the French Conservatory of Music where he studied from 1943 through 1948 with Bernard Baker. Maynard dropped out of Montreal High School at age 15 to more actively pursue a music career\, performing in dance bands led by Stan Wood\, Roland David\, and Johnny Holmes. During this period\, Maynard came to the attention of numerous American bandleaders and began receiving offers to come to the United States. Maynard moved to the United States in 1949 and initially played with the bands of Boyd Raeburn\, Jimmy Dorsey\, and Charlie Barnet. The Barnet band was notable for a trumpet section that also included Doc Severinsen\, Ray Wetzel\, Johnny Howell\, and Rolf Erickson. When Barnet temporarily retired in 1949 and disbanded his orchestra\, Maynard was free to accept an offer to join Stan Kenton's newly formed Innovations Orchestra\, a 40-piece jazz concert orchestra with strings. While the Innovations Orchestra was not commercially successful\, it made a number of remarkable recordings\, including "Maynard Ferguson\," one of a series of pieces named after featured soloists. When Kenton returned to a more practical 19-piece jazz band\, Maynard continued with him. So popular was Maynard with Kenton that for three years running\, 1950\, 1951\, and 1952\, he won the Down Beat Readers' Poll as best trumpeter. In 1953\, Maynard left Kenton to become a first-call session player for Paramount Pictures. Ferguson appeared on 46 soundtracks including The Ten Commandments. Ferguson still recorded jazz during this period\, but his Paramount contract prevented him from playing jazz clubs. While he enjoyed the regular paycheck\, Ferguson was very unhappy with the lack of live performance opportunities and left Paramount in 1956. In 1956\, Maynard was tapped to lead the Birdland Dream Band\, a 14-piece big band formed by Morris Levy as an "all-star" lineup to play at Levy's Birdland jazz club in New York City. While the name "Birdland Dream Band" was short-lived and is represented by only two albums\, this band became the core of Maynard's performing band for the next nine years. Following the path taken by many jazz artists in the 1960s\, Ferguson left the United States. Feeling that he needed a period of spiritual exploration. Maynard formed a new band and it made its North American debut in 1971. Maynard latched on to the burgeoning jazz education movement by recruiting talented musicians from colleges with jazz programs and targeting young audiences with performances and master classes in high schools. This practical and strategic move helped him develop a strong following that would sustain him for the remainder of his career. In 1988\, Maynard formed the group Big Bop Nouveau\, a nine-piece band featuring three trumpets\, one trombone\, two reeds and a three-piece rhythm section. The band's repertoire included original jazz compositions and modern arrangements of jazz standards\, with occasional pieces from his '70s book and the Birdland Dream Band; this format proved to be successful with audiences and critics. In 1992\, he was inducted into the Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame. Just days after completing a weeklong run at New York's Blue Note and recording a studio album in New Jersey\, Maynard developed an abdominal infection that resulted in kidney and liver failure. Ferguson died on the evening of August 23\, 2006 at the Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura\, California.	0

This ranks among Dion's best stuff\, and everyone out there ought to dig this track! There are lots of versions of this song out there by many different artists\, but this is the best one I have heard of all of them. I will admit that for the sake of having a good sounding copy\, i swiped the audio off of the cd version so it is the album length rather than the single edit\, but i rarely do something like that for my videos.

It is now out of print and fairly pricey\, so here's a vinyl rip for your enjoyment. Bette Bright was originally a prominent vocalist with Liverpool legends Deaf School before her solo career. This album features the likes of Clive Langer\, Ian Broudie\, James Eller and Lee "Kix" Thompson of Madness. Bette Bright (real name Anne Martin) married Graham "Suggs" McPherson (no introduction necessary) and retired from music to start a family. Recently\, however\, she has re-emerged along with Deaf School\, playing several reunion and tribute gigs. Oh and any eagle-eyes among us will have spotted a red-wigged Bette in the Sex Pistols movie Rock 'N' Roll Swindle (check the scene where Steve Jones...soils the gold record). Enjoy and t'interweb Bette's name for loads more information.	0

Join our Youtube: https://goo.gl/8AOGaN Join our Facebook: http://goo.gl/5oL723 Robert Leroy Johnson (May 8\, 1911 -- August 16\, 1938 ) was an American blues singer and musician. His landmark recordings from 1936--37 display a combination of singing\, guitar skills\, and songwriting talent that has influenced later generations of musicians. Johnson's shadowy\, poorly documented life and death at age 27 have given rise to much legend\, including the Faustian myth that he sold his soul at a crossroads to achieve success. As an itinerant performer who played mostly on street corners\, in juke joints\, and at Saturday night dances\, Johnson had little commercial success or public recognition in his lifetime.

Don't sent your kinfolk to give me no talkin' I'll be gone\, like I said.  You'd just say the same old thing That you be sayin' all along\, Just lay there in your bed and keep your mouth shut\, Till I'm gone. Don't give me that old familiar cry and fuss and moan  Understand your man\, I'm tired of your bad-mouthin' Understand your man.  You can give my other suit to the Salvation Army\, And everything else I leave behind I ain't takin' nothin' that'll slow down my travelin' While I'm untanglin' my mind.  I ain't gonna repeat What I said any more While I'm breathin' air that ain't been breathed before\, I'll be just as gone as the wild goose in winter  Then you'll understand your man\, meditate on it Understand your man\, you hear me talking Understand your man. Remember what I told you Understand your man Understand your man Written by Johnny R. Cash • Copyright © Warner/Chappell Music\, Inc https://play.google.com/music/preview/Tyczwzmbrbajoevxfsctw7b4sq4?lyrics=1&utm_source=google&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign=lyrics&pcampaignid=kp-songlyrics .  From Wikipedia\, the free encyclopedia "Understand Your Man" is a 1964 single by Johnny Cash.[1] The single went to number one on the country charts for six weeks.[2] "Understand Your Man" also crossed over to the Top 40\, peaking at number 35.[3]  Cash borrowed parts of the melody from Bob Dylan's "Don't Think Twice\, It's All Right".[4]  "Understand Your Man" was also the last song Cash ever performed in front of an audience. It was the last song in his performance at the Carter Family Fold in Hiltons\, Virginia\, on 5 July 2003. Prior to singing it\, Cash told the audience that at that point he had not performed it live in 25 years. (It was not\, however\, the final song he ever sang as despite failing health he continued to make studio recordings until late August 2003\, shortly before his death.)

Join our Youtube: https://goo.gl/8AOGaN Join our Facebook: http://goo.gl/5oL723 Robert Leroy Johnson (May 8\, 1911 -- August 16\, 1938 ) was an American blues singer and musician. His landmark recordings from 1936--37 display a combination of singing\, guitar skills\, and songwriting talent that has influenced later generations of musicians. Johnson's shadowy\, poorly documented life and death at age 27 have given rise to much legend\, including the Faustian myth that he sold his soul at a crossroads to achieve success. As an itinerant performer who played mostly on street corners\, in juke joints\, and at Saturday night dances\, Johnson had little commercial success or public recognition in his lifetime.

COL title VAL Sweet Emotion COL performer VAL The Mighty Mighty Bosstones	COL video title VAL Average White Band ~ If I Ever Lose This Heaven "1975" Funk COL channel name VAL 2chann COL description VAL Their self-effacing name to the contrary\, Average White Band was anything but -- one of the few white groups to cross the color line and achieve success and credibility playing funk\, with their tight\, fiery sound also belying their Scottish heritage\, evoking American R&B hotbeds like Detroit\, Memphis\, and Philadelphia instead. Singer/bassist Alan Gorrie\, guitarists Hamish Stuart and Onnie McIntyre\, tenor saxophonist Malcolm Duncan\, keyboardist/saxophonist Roger Ball\, and drummer Robbie McIntosh comprised the original Average White Band lineup. Veterans of numerous Scottish soul and jazz groups\, they made their debut in 1973 as the opening act at Eric Clapton's Rainbow Theatre comeback gig\, soon issuing their debut LP\, Show Your Hand\, to little notice. After adopting the abbreviated moniker AWB\, a year later the band issued their self-titled sophomore effort\, topping the American pop charts with the Arif Mardin-produced instrumental "Pick Up the Pieces." The record's mammoth success was nevertheless tempered by the September 23\, 1974 death of McIntosh\, who died at a Hollywood party after overdosing on heroin.  Cut the Cake Ex-Bloodstone drummer Steve Ferrone replaced McIntosh for AWB's third album\, 1975's Cut the Cake\, which scored a Top Ten hit with its title track as well as two other chart entries\, "If I Ever Lose This Heaven" and "School Boy Crush." (Put It Where You Want It\, issued later that same year\, was simply a retitled and repackaged Show Your Hand.) With 1976's Soul Searching\, the group reclaimed the full Average White Band name\, scoring their final Top 40 hit with "Queen of My Soul." Following the live Person to Person\, they issued Benny & Us\, a collaboration with soul legend Ben E. King. However\, after subsequent outings\, including 1978's Warmer Communications\, 1979's Feel No Fret\, and 1980's Shine\, failed to recapture the energy of AWB's peak\, the group dissolved in 1982\, with Ferrone later joining Duran Duran and Stuart recording with Paul McCartney. Gorrie\, Ball\, and McIntyre reformed Average White Band in 1989\, tapping vocalist Alex Ligertwood for their comeback effort Aftershock. Oft-sampled by hip-hop producers throughout the 1990s\, the group continued touring prior to releasing Soul Tattoo in 1996. The live album\, Face to Face\, followed three years later.

COL title VAL Little Joe the Wrangler COL performer VAL Red Steagall and The Coleman County Cowboys	COL video title VAL DENI HINES & CHRISTINE ANU - TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS COL channel name VAL denihines COL description VAL Two of Australias most loved and successful female recording artists\, Deni Hines and Christine Anu\, are takin it to the streets again in 2009 after the success of their 2008 East-Coast of Australia tour.    On the first tour we had such a great time\, that we wanted to do it all over again\, especially when we have such a great cause to promote such as the Salvation Army and Oasis Youth Support Network. We feel privileged to be able to help says Christine & Deni.    In a two hour show\, this sassy duo will perform their classic hits and favourite timeless songs along with some special duets\, including their own rendition of the Doobie Brothers hit TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS.   While promoting their 2008 tour\, Deni and Christine so happened to be performing one of their show duets TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS on the Today Show (Nine Network\, Australia). On the same show was a heartfelt segment about the plight of homelessness in Australia accompanied by Captain Paul Mould of the Salvation Armys Oasis Youth Support Network\, who take care and provide much needed services for the homeless and youth of Australia (who come from all walks of life.)  No less than 5 minutes after walking off set\, Christine and Deni turned to each other and said weve got to do something to help and the recording of TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS was set in motion.   Deni and Christine will release their version of TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS on 15 November 2008 (Nationwide) with fifty percent (50%) of profits going to the Salvation Armys Youth Homelessness Oasis Foundation and the Everyone Is Homeless Fund.  On Wednesday\, 17th December Christine and Deni will also stage a free Christmas concert version of their TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS show exclusively for the Salvation Armys Youth Homelessness Oasis Foundation and the homeless people of Sydney.   For further information on Salvation Armys Youth Homelessness Oasis Foundation and the Everyone Is Homeless Fund\, please refer to www.oasis.salvos.org.au  In the ABS Census 2001 (The 2006 Census data has not been finalized)\, there were 100\,000 homeless people (men\, women and children) across Australia\, one third (36\,173) are youth between 12-24 years of age.  Only 14.25% of homeless people were able to stay in services funded through SAAP (Supported Accommodation Assistance Program) jointly funded by both the Commonwealth and State Governments.  Christine and Deni would like to thank the following companies and people for donating their time and services free of charge of the purposes of this donation campaign drive -  301 Studios\, Sing Sing Studios\, David and Anthony @ DNA Songs\, Tony Espie\, David Walker at Stepford Audio\, John Adams\, Franco Raggatt\, Barbara Griffin\, Cameron Undy\, Michael Rohanek and Rob Thompson.	0

COL channel name VAL JUSTASITTINANDAROCK COL description VAL RARE OLDIES VIDEO WITH DAVE LAMBERT \, JON HENDRICKS & YOLANDA BAVAN ! The group formed in 1957 and recorded their first album Sing a Song of Basie for Paramount Records. The album featured versions of Count Basie standards and was successful enough that the Count Basie Orchestra collaborated with them on Sing Along With Basie (1959)\, which was awarded a Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 1998. Beginning in 1959\, the trio recorded three LPs with Columbia Records. Their song "Twisted\," featuring Ross's lyrics set to a Wardell Gray melody\, was featured in Woody Allen's Deconstructing Harry (1997) and has been covered by Joni Mitchell\, Bette Midler and others. Their High Flying won a Grammy Award for Best Performance by a Vocal Group in 1962. Lambert\, Hendricks & Ross were voted Best Vocal Group in the Down Beat Readers Poll from 1959 to 1963. Annie Ross left the group in 1962\, replaced by vocalist Yolande Bavan. The renamed Lambert\, Hendricks and Bavan made three live albums before disbanding in 1964. Lambert\, Hendricks and Bavan appeared at the 1962 Newport Jazz Festival\, and their performance of "Comin' Home" and "Moanin'" can be seen in Buddy Bregman's film The 1962 Newport Jazz Festival. The group was also known as Lambert\, Hendricks and Moss when Canadian jazz singer Anne Marie Moss briefly replaced Annie Ross. Any hopes of a reunion of the original trio ended with Lambert's 1966 death in a car accident. You can watch all my rare oldies soundies on : http://www.myspace.com/swingcocktail !

COL title VAL Bring Me Sunshine COL performer VAL Chet Atkins	COL video title VAL the temptations- i know i'm losing you COL channel name VAL Motown Deep Cuts\, PAMS Jingles & More with Tomovox COL description VAL A cold day in Hell...  The horrifying ring of truth- what it feels like to know you're losing someone you love...  Eddie Kendricks\, Melvin Franklin\, Otis Williams and Paul Williams are brothers of misery singing out the storm warning of failed love just around the bend.  A chorus keeping their emotions in check until they come to that hook line:  "Losing You-oooo"  where the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end...  David Ruffin.  The poor man is in so much anguish and yet his vocals never go completely off the rails.  The amazing thing about David and company is how much emotion they pack into those lyrics while keeping the singing just one step away from total abandon.  Economy in vocalizing\, not "over-singing"; sometimes it's those tightly controlled vocals that tear your guts out- you get the feeling the man is about to combust at any moment and you're just waiting for the other shoe to drop...	0

All pieces in this "Alan Parsons SongBook" are spellbinding\, mindbending\, hypnotic. With all their variety - and there is a huge range of dynamics in the songs\, written by Parsons and Woolfson - there is always a sense of unity and peace\, nature and silence and personal thought. It is almost as if Alan and Eric had set out to produce only classics\, masterpieces - and calmly went ahead and did just that.  The wonderfully rich\, vibrant sound to The Alex Bollard Assembly never had more intrinsically superb material to apply itself to than on this compact disc. Together the 19 highlights from the SongBook of Alan Parsons form a collection of tunes that are indisputably outstanding.	0

COL title VAL Drop down Mama COL performer VAL Big Joe Williams	COL video title VAL Roots of Blues  Mississippi John Hurt „Candy Man Blues COL channel name VAL Literatisch COL description VAL „Candy Man Blues (J. Hurt)  Recorded: New York City\, December 28\,1928 Mississippi John Hurt (vcl)(g).  Born John Smith Hurt in Teoc\,  Carroll County\, Mississippi and raised in Avalon\, Mississippi\, Hurt learned to play guitar at age 9. He spent much of his youth playing old time music for friends and dances\, earning a living as a farm hand into the 1920s. In 1923 he partnered with the fiddle player Willie Narmour as a substitute for his regular partner Shell Smith. When Narmour got a chance to record for Okeh Records as a prize for winning first place in a 1928 fiddle contest\, Narmour recommended John Hurt to Okeh Records producer Tommy Rockwell. After auditioning "Monday Morning Blues" at his home\, he took part in two recording sessions\, in Memphis and New York City (see Discography below). The "Mississippi" tag was added by Okeh as a sales gimmick. After the commercial failure of the resulting records\, and Okeh Records going out of business during the Great Depression\, Hurt returned to Avalon and obscurity\, working as a sharecropper and playing local parties and dances.  In 1963\, however\, a folk musicologist\, Tom Hoskins\, inspired by the recordings\, was able to locate Hurt near Avalon\, Mississippi. Seeing that Hurt's guitar playing skills were still intact\, Hoskins encouraged him to move to Washington\, D.C.\, and begin performing on a wider stage. His performance at the 1964 Newport Folk Festival saw his star rise amongst the new folk revival audience. Before his death he played extensively in colleges\, concert halls\, coffee houses and also on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson\, as well as recording three further albums for Vanguard Records. The numbers his devotees particularly liked were the ragtime songs "Salty Dog" and "Candy Man"\, and the blues ballads "Spike Driver Blues" (a variant of "John Henry") and "Frankie".  Hurt's influence spanned several music genres including blues\, country\, bluegrass\, folk and contemporary rock and roll. A soft-spoken man\, his nature was reflected in the work\, which remained a mellow mix of country\, blues and old time music to the end.[7]  Hurt died in November 1966 from a heart attack in Grenada\, Mississippi	0

Don't sent your kinfolk to give me no talkin' I'll be gone\, like I said.  You'd just say the same old thing That you be sayin' all along\, Just lay there in your bed and keep your mouth shut\, Till I'm gone. Don't give me that old familiar cry and fuss and moan  Understand your man\, I'm tired of your bad-mouthin' Understand your man.  You can give my other suit to the Salvation Army\, And everything else I leave behind I ain't takin' nothin' that'll slow down my travelin' While I'm untanglin' my mind.  I ain't gonna repeat What I said any more While I'm breathin' air that ain't been breathed before\, I'll be just as gone as the wild goose in winter  Then you'll understand your man\, meditate on it Understand your man\, you hear me talking Understand your man. Remember what I told you Understand your man Understand your man Written by Johnny R.

From Wikipedia\, the free encyclopedia "Understand Your Man" is a 1964 single by Johnny Cash.[1] The single went to number one on the country charts for six weeks.[2] "Understand Your Man" also crossed over to the Top 40\, peaking at number 35.[3]  Cash borrowed parts of the melody from Bob Dylan's "Don't Think Twice\, It's All Right".[4]  "Understand Your Man" was also the last song Cash ever performed in front of an audience. It was the last song in his performance at the Carter Family Fold in Hiltons\, Virginia\, on 5 July 2003. Prior to singing it\, Cash told the audience that at that point he had not performed it live in 25 years. (It was not\, however\, the final song he ever sang as despite failing health he continued to make studio recordings until late August 2003\, shortly before his death.)

COL title VAL Green Rocky Road COL performer VAL Tim Hardin	COL video title VAL the temptations- i know i'm losing you COL channel name VAL Motown Deep Cuts\, PAMS Jingles & More with Tomovox COL description VAL A cold day in Hell...  The horrifying ring of truth- what it feels like to know you're losing someone you love...  Eddie Kendricks\, Melvin Franklin\, Otis Williams and Paul Williams are brothers of misery singing out the storm warning of failed love just around the bend.  A chorus keeping their emotions in check until they come to that hook line:  "Losing You-oooo"  where the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end...  David Ruffin.  The poor man is in so much anguish and yet his vocals never go completely off the rails.  The amazing thing about David and company is how much emotion they pack into those lyrics while keeping the singing just one step away from total abandon.  Economy in vocalizing\, not "over-singing"; sometimes it's those tightly controlled vocals that tear your guts out- you get the feeling the man is about to combust at any moment and you're just waiting for the other shoe to drop...	0

I will admit that for the sake of having a good sounding copy\, i swiped the audio off of the cd version so it is the album length rather than the single edit\, but i rarely do something like that for my videos.

She speaks fluently Spanish\, English and Italian. Due to her great voice\, she has been compared to famous international singers\, to Whitney Houston above all. Session vocalist for various Dance productions in the 90's\, she's been performing a lot around the World and has taken part in many TV shows in Italy. She's also an author: she wrote for Mario Biondi on the albums 'Handful of soul' and 'I love you more'\, she co-wrote most of the songs on the Papik album 'Rhythm of life'\, together with her producer Nerio Poggi (aka Papik)\, including 'Staying for Good'\, the single from the album that's getting a great response worldwide. This is her first album under her own name and it's dedicated to remakes in a soul-jazz style of tunes from the 80's and 90's. Among the songs chosen: a bossa cover of 'Rhythm of the night' by Corona and an R&B version of 'Barbie Girl'. But the self-penned '1986' is the real gem on this album!

It is now out of print and fairly pricey\, so here's a vinyl rip for your enjoyment. Bette Bright was originally a prominent vocalist with Liverpool legends Deaf School before her solo career. This album features the likes of Clive Langer\, Ian Broudie\, James Eller and Lee "Kix" Thompson of Madness. Bette Bright (real name Anne Martin) married Graham "Suggs" McPherson (no introduction necessary) and retired from music to start a family. Recently\, however\, she has re-emerged along with Deaf School\, playing several reunion and tribute gigs. Oh and any eagle-eyes among us will have spotted a red-wigged Bette in the Sex Pistols movie Rock 'N' Roll Swindle (check the scene where Steve Jones...soils the gold record).

COL title VAL Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands COL performer VAL Joan Baez	COL video title VAL Average White Band ~ If I Ever Lose This Heaven "1975" Funk COL channel name VAL 2chann COL description VAL Their self-effacing name to the contrary\, Average White Band was anything but -- one of the few white groups to cross the color line and achieve success and credibility playing funk\, with their tight\, fiery sound also belying their Scottish heritage\, evoking American R&B hotbeds like Detroit\, Memphis\, and Philadelphia instead. Singer/bassist Alan Gorrie\, guitarists Hamish Stuart and Onnie McIntyre\, tenor saxophonist Malcolm Duncan\, keyboardist/saxophonist Roger Ball\, and drummer Robbie McIntosh comprised the original Average White Band lineup. Veterans of numerous Scottish soul and jazz groups\, they made their debut in 1973 as the opening act at Eric Clapton's Rainbow Theatre comeback gig\, soon issuing their debut LP\, Show Your Hand\, to little notice. After adopting the abbreviated moniker AWB\, a year later the band issued their self-titled sophomore effort\, topping the American pop charts with the Arif Mardin-produced instrumental "Pick Up the Pieces." The record's mammoth success was nevertheless tempered by the September 23\, 1974 death of McIntosh\, who died at a Hollywood party after overdosing on heroin.  Cut the Cake Ex-Bloodstone drummer Steve Ferrone replaced McIntosh for AWB's third album\, 1975's Cut the Cake\, which scored a Top Ten hit with its title track as well as two other chart entries\, "If I Ever Lose This Heaven" and "School Boy Crush." (Put It Where You Want It\, issued later that same year\, was simply a retitled and repackaged Show Your Hand.) With 1976's Soul Searching\, the group reclaimed the full Average White Band name\, scoring their final Top 40 hit with "Queen of My Soul." Following the live Person to Person\, they issued Benny & Us\, a collaboration with soul legend Ben E. King. However\, after subsequent outings\, including 1978's Warmer Communications\, 1979's Feel No Fret\, and 1980's Shine\, failed to recapture the energy of AWB's peak\, the group dissolved in 1982\, with Ferrone later joining Duran Duran and Stuart recording with Paul McCartney. Gorrie\, Ball\, and McIntyre reformed Average White Band in 1989\, tapping vocalist Alex Ligertwood for their comeback effort Aftershock. Oft-sampled by hip-hop producers throughout the 1990s\, the group continued touring prior to releasing Soul Tattoo in 1996. The live album\, Face to Face\, followed three years later.

Fools Fall In Love  ------------------------  "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" is a song by American punk rock band Green Day. It was released as the second single from their seventh album\, American Idiot. The song was written by Green Day\, with lyrics by lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong. The single peaked at number two in the United States\, making it Green Day's most successful song.  Influences and covers  Noel Gallagher of Oasis criticized Green Day in late 2006\, saying\, "They should have the decency to wait until I am dead [before stealing my songs]. I\, at least\, pay the people I steal from that courtesy"\, referencing the fact that "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" uses the same chord progression as Oasis's hit single "Wonderwall". Gallagher's reaction may have partly been due to the emergence of "Boulevard of Broken Songs"\, a popular mash-up mixed by San Francisco DJ and producer Party Ben in late 2004. The mix consisted of elements from "Boulevard of Broken Dreams"\, "Wonderwall"\, Travis' "Writing to Reach You" and Eminem's "Sing for the Moment"\, which itself has samples from Aerosmith's "Dream On" (another remix by Party Ben featured this\, "Wonderwall" and Kanye West's "Flashing Lights"). This song was covered by Japanese-American singer Hikaru Utada acoustically with a guitar during an internet broadcast in December 2005; a video of it can be found. "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" is sung first and then fades into "Passion" (After the Battle version) from the Kingdom Hearts II original soundtrack. "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" is also featured in the movie trailer of Lords of Dogtown (2005)\, starring Heath Ledger\, Emile Hirsch and John Robinson. Billie Joe Armstrong wrote the song while he was in his son Joey's bedroom.[citation needed] In the 2005 VH1 Storytellers program featuring Green Day\, Billie Joe Armstrong stated that the title of the song was "nicked" from the famous Gottfried Helnwein painting of the same title\, which features James Dean. Four earlier songs also have the same title: an old Harry Warren song\, a Hanoi Rocks song\, a Marianne Faithfull song\, and song by Brian Setzer from his 1986 album The Knife Feels Like Justice Lyrics from the song bear some resemblance to the Pinhead Gunpowder song "I Walk Alone"\, a band in which Billie Joe Armstrong also sings. It appeared on their 1997 album\, Goodbye Ellston Avenue. The song also shares some lyrics with the Whitesnake song "Here I Go Again"\, the words "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" can be found in the lyrics of the Elvis Costello song "Brilliant Mistake"\, the Allman Brothers Band song "End of the Line"\, the Deadsy song "The Key to Gramercy Park"\, and The Ataris song "Road Signs and Rock Songs". The phrase "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" also appears in punk/new wave band Blondie's 1982 minor UK-hit single Island of Lost Souls. A live version of the song can be found on Bullet in a Bible\, a live album of Green Day performing at the Milton Keynes National Bowl. Bluegrass band Cornbread Red did a cover of the song on a tribute album to Green Day Pickin' on Green Day\, while the German choir Gregorian did a cover\, on their Masters of Chant Chapter V album\, in the style of a Gregorian Chant. Mark Mallman covered this song on his MP3-only compilation release Outtakes Vol 1. The song is also featured in Green Day's musical American Idiot\, sung on the cast recording by John Gallagher Jr.\, Rebecca Naomi Jones\, and the rest of the company.	1

Oh how I wish I were there myself\, Tw rymdi ro rymdi radl idl al. There is the house and there is the barn; There is the door of the cow house open. Ffaldi radl idl al\, ffaldi radl idl al\, Tw rymdi ro rymdi radl idl al.  There is the gallant\, branching oak\, A vision\, lovingly crowned. I will wait in her shade Until my love comes to meet me.  There is the harp\, there are her strings; What better am I\, without anyone to play her for? There's the delicate fair one\, exquisite and full of life; What nearer am I\, without having her attention?	0

It was released on their debut album A Flock of Seagulls in 1982 and was its most successful single\, reaching number 9 in the United States and number 1 in Australia.  Single  The single was promoted by a distinctive music video in which the band members performed in a room covered in aluminum foil and mirrors. The cameras used to film the video are clearly visible in many of the background reflections\, their stands also covered in foil. The video is a homage to Brian Eno and Robert Fripp's (No Pussyfooting) album cover\, which was also respectively portrayed by The Strokes for their single\, "The End Has No End" two decades later. The video received heavy rotation on MTV in the summer of 1982\, and helped the single to become a hit. The video features a different edit of "I Ran" than the album version; the introduction was greatly shortened.  The band toured the United States extensively to promote the single\, supporting Squeeze on their 1982 tour. As well as reaching #9 on the Billboard Hot 100\, "I Ran" peaked at #3 on the Mainstream Rock chart and #8 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. Subsequently the album reached number 10 on the Billboard 200.  Despite success in the States and Australia\, the single did not enjoy similar success in the band's home country (United Kingdom)\, failing to make the top 40.  In an interview on the VH1 special 100 Greatest Songs of the '80s\, Mike Score said that he resents the song\, but plays it live because people enjoy it. "I Ran" was listed at #55 on the countdown. In VH1's 100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders of the 80s\, the song was listed at #2\, with Mike Score's interview played again.  Although considered an '80s New Wave classic\, the song experienced somewhat of a revival in 2002 as the signature theme for the video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City; being played during the game's television commercials and during gameplay as one of the songs in the playlist for radio station Wave 103.  Along with the Bowling for Soup cover\, it was also used as the theme song for the English dub of the anime series Knights of the Zodiac which was later removed from the air during its first season.  The song briefly featured in the Dead Zone Season 2 episode 'Playing God'\, heard during a party scene. It can also be heard during a nightclub scene in the 2005 Nick Love film The Business.  The master recording is available as a playable song in Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s as well as the rebooted version of Karaoke Revolution. The song was from the TV show Everybody Hates Chris entitled Everybody Hates the Last Day  It was performed by the Ska Rangers in the film The Hangover: Part II during the closing scene.  Also\, Fez sung a verse in That 70's Show during one of the "Circles" in the fourth season's opener.  Cover versions  "I Ran" has been covered by a number of artists:  Tori Amos covered the song on her Original Sinsuality/Summer Of Sin Tour in Denver\, during Piano Bar Time. Her version was released with the rest of the show in the 3rd CD of The Original Bootlegs.  Assemblage 23 recorded the song for the 1997 compilation Newer Wave.  Cranial Screwtop recorded a version of the song for their 2006 album "Too Fast for Technology".  Terminal Choice's cover of the song is included on the bonus disk of their 2006 album New Born Enemies.  Bowling for Soup covered the song for the 2003 re-release of their album Drunk Enough to Dance and their "Punk Rock 101" single. Both the original and the punk cover are the theme song of the American version of Saint Seiya\, also known as Knights of the Zodiac.  Hidden in Plain View recorded the song on the covers compilation album Punk Goes 80s.  In Dance Dance Revolution: Hottest Party 2\, Spacebar vs Naughty G covered this song.  Darude and Blake Lewis released a cover in 2008.  Nickelback covered the song during their Dark Horse Tour in 2010. It was sung by guitarist/vocalist Ryan Peake.  Slim Thug also took the bass line of this song to produce his single "I Run"  Umphrey's Mcgee covered the song during a performance at the Birmingham Southern College on 4/9/05\, however they have played it many times before.  Ska Rangers covered the song which featured on the film and soundtrack of The Hangover: Part II.	0

Ffaldi radl idl al\, ffaldi radl idl al\, Tw rymdi ro rymdi radl idl al.  There is the gallant\, branching oak\, A vision\, lovingly crowned. I will wait in her shade Until my love comes to meet me.  There is the harp\, there are her strings; What better am I\, without anyone to play her for? There's the delicate fair one\, exquisite and full of life; What nearer am I\, without having her attention?	0

COL title VAL Rock On COL performer VAL Love Inks	COL video title VAL Uriah Heep - Lady in Black COL channel name VAL TheDeZyx COL description VAL http://www.discogs.com/artist/Uriah+Heep http://www.myspace.com/uriaheep  Uriah Heep's by-the-books progressive heavy metal made the British band one of the most popular hard rock groups of the early '70s. Formed by vocalist David Byron and guitarist Mick Box in the late '60s\, the group went through an astonishing number of members over the next two decades — nearly 30 different musicians passed through the band over the years. Byron and Box were members of the mid-'60s rock band called the Stalkers; once that band broke up\, the duo formed another group called Spice. Spice would eventually turn into Uriah Heep in the late '60s\, once Ken Hensley (guitar\, keyboards\, vocals) and bassist Paul Newton joined the pair. Former Spice drummer Alex Napier was the band's drummer for a brief time; he was quickly replaced by Nigel Olsson. Uriah Heep released their debut album Very 'eavy...Very 'umble (called Uriah Heep in the U.S.) in 1970. After its release\, Keith Baker became the group's drummer; he recorded Salisbury\, the group's second album\, before deciding he couldn't keep up with the band's extensive touring and was replaced by Ian Clarke. Salisbury\, featuring a 16-minute title track recorded with a 26-piece orchestra\, showcased the band's more progressive tendencies. Later that year\, Ian Clarke was replaced by Lee Kerslake and Mark Clarke replaced Newton; Mark Clarke quickly left the band and Gary Thain became the group's bassist. This lineup of Uriah Heep was its most stable and popular; beginning with 1972's Demons and Wizards\, they released five albums between 1972 and 1975. After 1975\, the band's popularity began to slip. Byron left the band in 1977 and was replaced by John Lawton\, yet the group's fortunes kept declining right into the early '80s. However\, Uriah Heep soldiered on\, continuing to release albums into the '90s and 2000s. The album roster included Different World (1994)\, Sea of Light (1995)\, Sonic Origami (1998)\, and Spellbinder (1999).	0

COL title VAL Why I'm Walking COL performer VAL Heather Myles	COL video title VAL Mitch Miller - The River Kwai March ~ Colonel Bogey March COL channel name VAL ubsswp COL description VAL RIP Mitch Miller! He died 99 years old!  Mitchell William Miller (July 4\, 1911 -- July 31\, 2010)was an American musician\, singer\, conductor\, record producer\, A&R man and record company executive. He was one of the most influential figures in American popular music during the 1950s and early 1960s.  In the early '50s Miller recorded with Columbia's house band as "Mitchell Miller and His Orchestra". He also recorded a string of successful albums and singles\, featuring a male chorale and his own distinctive arrangements\, under the name "Mitch Miller and the Gang" starting in 1950. The ensemble's hits included "Tzena\, Tzena\, Tzena"\, "The Yellow Rose of Texas"\, and the two marches from The Bridge on the River Kwai: "The River Kwai March and Colonel Bogey March".  The Bridge on the River Kwai is a British 1957 World War II film by David Lean; based on the novel The Bridge over the River Kwai by French writer Pierre Boulle. The film is a work of fiction but borrows the construction of the Burma Railway in 1942-43 for its historical setting. It stars Alec Guinness\, Sessue Hayakawa\, Jack Hawkins and William Holden.  In 1997\, this film was deemed "culturally\, historically\, or aesthetically significant" and selected for preservation in the United States Library of Congress National Film Registry.  Two prisoners of war are burying a corpse in the graveyard of a Japanese World War II prison camp in southern Burma. One\, American Navy Commander Shears (William Holden)\, routinely bribes guards to ensure he gets sick duty\, which allows him to avoid hard labour. A large contingent of British prisoners arrives\, marching in defiantly whistling the Colonel Bogey March under the leadership of Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness).  A memorable feature of the film is the tune that is whistled by the POWs—the "Colonel Bogey March"—when they enter the camp.The piece was originally written in 1914 by Kenneth Alford. It was accompanied by a counter-melody (known as "The River Kwai March") written by the film's composer\, Malcolm Arnold\, and played by the off-screen orchestra taking over from the whistlers. Mitch Miller had a hit with a recording of both marches.	0

COL title VAL I Second That Emotion COL performer VAL José Feliciano	COL video title VAL Eiffel 65 - Blue (Da Ba Dee) COL channel name VAL malawolf85 COL description VAL Eiffel 65 is a three man (Gianfranco Randone\, Maurizio Lobina\, and Gabriele Ponte) Italian eurodance group. Best know for their international hit "Blue (Da Ba Dee)" Eiffel 65's debut album "Europop" sold over two million units in the US\, making them the best selling Italian eurodance group ever in the United States. The origin of the group's name is an interesting sequence of chance. The name "Eiffel" was chosen randomly by a computer program and the "65" was scribbled onto their name on a demo by mistake; it was actually part of a phone number. The group Eiffel 65 is also known for their many remixes of songs from other artists\, with over thirty of them to their name. In 2005 Gabriele Ponte left the group to focus on his solo career and in 2006 the reminding members left the Bliss Corporation to form their own duo called Bloom 06. The Bliss Corporation\, who owns the name Eiffel 65\, had announced a new line up for the group would be debuting in the summer of 2007 however the debut was postponed until further notice.	0

COL title VAL Say\, Has Anybody Seen My Sweet Gipsy Rose COL performer VAL Mrs. Mills	COL video title VAL FOUR UNTIL LATE (1937) by Robert Johnson COL channel name VAL wilson mcphert COL description VAL I first heard 'Four Until Late' sung by Eric Clapton on the Fresh Cream album. It was one of the first songs I learned on guitar\, and one I still like doing.  .   Robert Johnson\, of course\, was the author of the song (although clearly influenced by Blind Blake's 'Georgia Bound'- see my video). In 1937\, he travelled to Dallas\, Texas\, for his second and final recording session in a makeshift studio at the Brunswick Record Building\, 508 Park Avenue. He recorded this song on 19 June 1937.   It goes without saying that Johnson was one of the most influential blues singers in history. Wikipedia has a substantial profile on him.   There are only two photos of Johnson that I know of\, and I have used these and others to make a slideshow video.   Comments are welcome.	0

COL title VAL Keep the Customer Satisfied COL performer VAL Gary Puckett	COL video title VAL the temptations- i know i'm losing you COL channel name VAL Motown Deep Cuts\, PAMS Jingles & More with Tomovox COL description VAL A cold day in Hell...  The horrifying ring of truth- what it feels like to know you're losing someone you love...  Eddie Kendricks\, Melvin Franklin\, Otis Williams and Paul Williams are brothers of misery singing out the storm warning of failed love just around the bend.  A chorus keeping their emotions in check until they come to that hook line:  "Losing You-oooo"  where the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end...  David Ruffin.  The poor man is in so much anguish and yet his vocals never go completely off the rails.  The amazing thing about David and company is how much emotion they pack into those lyrics while keeping the singing just one step away from total abandon.  Economy in vocalizing\, not "over-singing"; sometimes it's those tightly controlled vocals that tear your guts out- you get the feeling the man is about to combust at any moment and you're just waiting for the other shoe to drop...	0

You Got It Coming (Supertonic Remix)  ------------------------  "R.A.M.O.N.E.S." is a song first recorded by the British rock band Motörhead on their 1991 album 1916 as a tribute to their friends and contemporaries\, the Ramones. The bands were long-standing admirers of each other's work. Critic Andy Boot\, reviewing the album in Kerrang (27 February 1991) described the song as "the icing on a very fine\, if somewhat heavy\, cake."  "It was the ultimate honor - like John Lennon writing a song for you". -Joey Ramone  The track was first aired before Phil Taylor and Würzel left the band and has continued as a live staple.  Cover versions  It also appears as a bonus track on the album Fang Bang by Wednesday 13.  The Ramones also performed it on and off until their final show in August 1996 at which C.J. Ramone and Lemmy shared lead vocals. Two different studio versions were recorded. One appears as a bonus track on their album ¡Adios Amigos! with C.J. Ramone singing lead vocals and the other one on the Greatest Hits Live with Joey Ramone singing lead vocals.  The Huntingtons also covered this song on their File Under Ramones album.  "R.A.M.O.N.E.S." was also covered by the Offspring on their performance at Rock in Rio 5 on September 14\, 2013. At that show\, Marky Ramone (who was the drummer of the Ramones from 1978 to 1983\, and again from 1987 to their breakup in 1996) joined them onstage to perform cover versions of "R.A.M.O.N.E.S." and "California Sun".  ------------------------  Lyrics  New York City\, N.Y.C.

COL title VAL Don't Answer Me COL performer VAL proGrammar	COL video title VAL Alex Bollard Assembly - Don't Answer Me COL channel name VAL Andi Deris COL description VAL The Alan Parsons SongBook is an album to give you the opportunity to enjoy the music of the Alan Parsons Project played by The Alex Bollard Assembly and to accompany these vital musicians on their trip to the exciting experience of unlimited sound possibilities.  All pieces in this "Alan Parsons SongBook" are spellbinding\, mindbending\, hypnotic. With all their variety - and there is a huge range of dynamics in the songs\, written by Parsons and Woolfson - there is always a sense of unity and peace\, nature and silence and personal thought. It is almost as if Alan and Eric had set out to produce only classics\, masterpieces - and calmly went ahead and did just that.  The wonderfully rich\, vibrant sound to The Alex Bollard Assembly never had more intrinsically superb material to apply itself to than on this compact disc. Together the 19 highlights from the SongBook of Alan Parsons form a collection of tunes that are indisputably outstanding.	1

Now The Luck of Eden Hall give it a Chicago psych rock feel and produce something pretty special along the way - nice one\, Curvey.  The Luck of Eden Hall will be familiar to followers of Fruits de Mer\, and 'Something' doesn't disappoint.   This is a 2 minute excerpt from a track on the new Fruits de Mer Records double album 'Keep Off The Grass' - on sale December 2011.   'Keep Off The Grass' is a limited-edition\, vinyl-only\, massive compilation of classic and obscure sixties tracks - from phased sunshine pop to dark fuzz\, and all things in between (and either side).  19 bands\, 19 tracks\, 85 minutes of music exclusive to this compilation.

I've never found it on any CD\, and I doubt it will ever be reissued. This dub is from a mint promo copy.  Its a little too gummy to be called Power Pop\, but its a fun record. It almost beats the Rubinoos at their own game. It was only a mid-charting hit\, though I remember KLAW and KSWO in Lawton OK giving it a few spins back in the summer of 1977.   And I've never found another 45 by this group. Were they a studio group or a real band?   And if that Scott Shannon on the label is the DJ who now runs the "True Oldies" network and has programmed so many legendary Top 40-CHR radio stations in the past - thanks for a great record.. too bad it didnt do better!	0

It was released on their debut album A Flock of Seagulls in 1982 and was its most successful single\, reaching number 9 in the United States and number 1 in Australia.  Single  The single was promoted by a distinctive music video in which the band members performed in a room covered in aluminum foil and mirrors. The cameras used to film the video are clearly visible in many of the background reflections\, their stands also covered in foil. The video is a homage to Brian Eno and Robert Fripp's (No Pussyfooting) album cover\, which was also respectively portrayed by The Strokes for their single\, "The End Has No End" two decades later. The video received heavy rotation on MTV in the summer of 1982\, and helped the single to become a hit. The video features a different edit of "I Ran" than the album version; the introduction was greatly shortened.  The band toured the United States extensively to promote the single\, supporting Squeeze on their 1982 tour. As well as reaching #9 on the Billboard Hot 100\, "I Ran" peaked at #3 on the Mainstream Rock chart and #8 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. Subsequently the album reached number 10 on the Billboard 200.  Despite success in the States and Australia\, the single did not enjoy similar success in the band's home country (United Kingdom)\, failing to make the top 40.  In an interview on the VH1 special 100 Greatest Songs of the '80s\, Mike Score said that he resents the song\, but plays it live because people enjoy it. "I Ran" was listed at #55 on the countdown. In VH1's 100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders of the 80s\, the song was listed at #2\, with Mike Score's interview played again.  Although considered an '80s New Wave classic\, the song experienced somewhat of a revival in 2002 as the signature theme for the video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City; being played during the game's television commercials and during gameplay as one of the songs in the playlist for radio station Wave 103.  Along with the Bowling for Soup cover\, it was also used as the theme song for the English dub of the anime series Knights of the Zodiac which was later removed from the air during its first season.  The song briefly featured in the Dead Zone Season 2 episode 'Playing God'\, heard during a party scene. It can also be heard during a nightclub scene in the 2005 Nick Love film The Business.  The master recording is available as a playable song in Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s as well as the rebooted version of Karaoke Revolution. The song was from the TV show Everybody Hates Chris entitled Everybody Hates the Last Day  It was performed by the Ska Rangers in the film The Hangover: Part II during the closing scene.  Also\, Fez sung a verse in That 70's Show during one of the "Circles" in the fourth season's opener.  Cover versions  "I Ran" has been covered by a number of artists:  Tori Amos covered the song on her Original Sinsuality/Summer Of Sin Tour in Denver\, during Piano Bar Time. Her version was released with the rest of the show in the 3rd CD of The Original Bootlegs.  Assemblage 23 recorded the song for the 1997 compilation Newer Wave.  Cranial Screwtop recorded a version of the song for their 2006 album "Too Fast for Technology".  Terminal Choice's cover of the song is included on the bonus disk of their 2006 album New Born Enemies.  Bowling for Soup covered the song for the 2003 re-release of their album Drunk Enough to Dance and their "Punk Rock 101" single. Both the original and the punk cover are the theme song of the American version of Saint Seiya\, also known as Knights of the Zodiac.  Hidden in Plain View recorded the song on the covers compilation album Punk Goes 80s.  In Dance Dance Revolution: Hottest Party 2\, Spacebar vs Naughty G covered this song.  Darude and Blake Lewis released a cover in 2008.  Nickelback covered the song during their Dark Horse Tour in 2010. It was sung by guitarist/vocalist Ryan Peake.  Slim Thug also took the bass line of this song to produce his single "I Run"  Umphrey's Mcgee covered the song during a performance at the Birmingham Southern College on 4/9/05\, however they have played it many times before.  Ska Rangers covered the song which featured on the film and soundtrack of The Hangover: Part II.	0

It's on here\, so give it a listen. It's one of the more bizarre country songs I've heard in my life. This tune which Eddie wrote was a #5 hit for Hank Snow in 1956. During his lifetime (1930-1978)\, Eddie was quite a prolific artist on a variety of small labels\, but only hit the charts once with "Have Blues Will Travel" (#14 in 1958). SO prolific\, in fact\, that I'm having a hard time nailing down a year for this particular single. One site claims 1974\, so we'll go with that for now. :) Enjoy!	1

COL title VAL Drag Me Down COL performer VAL Backtrack	COL video title VAL Jerry Lee Lewis - Let's Talk About Us COL channel name VAL Music Legends Book COL description VAL Jerry Lee Lewis (born September 29\, 1935) is an American singer-songwriter\, musician\, and pianist\, who is often known by his nickname of The Killer and is often viewed as "rock & roll's first great wild man." As an early pioneer of rock and roll music\, in 1956 Lewis made his first recordings at Sun Records in Memphis. "Crazy Arms" sold 300\,000 copies in the South\, but it was his 1957 hit "Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On" that shot Lewis to fame worldwide. Lewis followed this when he recorded songs such as "Great Balls of Fire"\, "Breathless" and "High School Confidential". However\, Lewis's rock and roll career faltered in the wake of his marriage to his 13-year-old cousin when he was 22. He had little success in the charts following the scandal and his popularity quickly faded. His live performance fees plummeted from $10\,000 per night to $250. In the meantime he was determined to gain back some of his popularity. During the early 1960s he didn't have much chart success with few exceptions such as "What'd I Say". His live performances at this time were increasingly wild and energetic. His album Live at the Star Club\, Hamburg from 1964 is often regarded by many music journalists and fans as one of the wildest and greatest rock and roll concert albums ever. After recording songs such as "I'm on Fire" for several years with little success\, in 1968 Lewis made a transition into country music and had hits with songs such as "Another Place\, Another Time". This reignited his career and throughout the late 1960s and 1970s he regularly topped the country-western charts. His No. 1 country hits included "To Make Love Sweeter For You"\, "There Must Be More to Love Than This"\, "Would You Take Another Chance on Me" and "Me and Bobby McGee"	0

Don't give me that old familiar cry and fuss and moan  Understand your man\, I'm tired of your bad-mouthin' Understand your man.  You can give my other suit to the Salvation Army\, And everything else I leave behind I ain't takin' nothin' that'll slow down my travelin' While I'm untanglin' my mind.  I ain't gonna repeat What I said any more While I'm breathin' air that ain't been breathed before\, I'll be just as gone as the wild goose in winter  Then you'll understand your man\, meditate on it Understand your man\, you hear me talking Understand your man. Remember what I told you Understand your man Understand your man Written by Johnny R.

From Wikipedia\, the free encyclopedia "Understand Your Man" is a 1964 single by Johnny Cash.[1] The single went to number one on the country charts for six weeks.[2] "Understand Your Man" also crossed over to the Top 40\, peaking at number 35.[3]  Cash borrowed parts of the melody from Bob Dylan's "Don't Think Twice\, It's All Right".[4]  "Understand Your Man" was also the last song Cash ever performed in front of an audience. It was the last song in his performance at the Carter Family Fold in Hiltons\, Virginia\, on 5 July 2003. Prior to singing it\, Cash told the audience that at that point he had not performed it live in 25 years. (It was not\, however\, the final song he ever sang as despite failing health he continued to make studio recordings until late August 2003\, shortly before his death.)

Purchase from the label: http://www.paradiseofbachelors.com/shop/pob-21 Purchase from Bandcamp: https://paradiseofbachelors.bandcamp.com/album/ambsace Other options: http://lnk.to/PoB21  The second album of astonishing duets by guitarists James Elkington (who has toured and/or recorded with Jeff Tweedy\, Richard Thompson\, and Steve Gunn\, among others) and Nathan Salsburg (an accomplished soloist deemed by NPR “one of those names we’ll all associate with American folk guitar”) is a sublime suite of nimble\, filigreed compositions by two singular stylists. Belying its title—“ambsace” is the lowest throw of dice; snake eyes—the record thrives on a gentle empathy and generosity of spirit\, sitting sneakily protean original compositions alongside gorgeous arrangements of songs by Duke Ellington and The Smiths at the same big hand-hewn table.

In June 1987 Gerald Arthur Friend picked up a 14-year-old female friend after leaving a concert at the Tacoma Dome. Upon trying to exit the car the girl was handcuffed and held hostage at knife point. The girl was taken to a mobile home where she was tortured and raped with various objects for two days. She was also threatened with a blowtorch."  we recorded our cover of "polly" for SPIN magazine's "Newermind" tribute/compilation to mark the 20th anniversary of "Nevermind" in september. michael (who a lot of you have seen as the new drummer of my touring band\, the grand theft orchestra) produced/engineered and played bass on the recording.  this is a video me (glockenspiel\, vocals\, Taurus bass pedal)\, chad raines (banjo\, percussion)\, and michael (bass\, percussion) shot in new haven\, CT on a super-tight budget with the help of some actors and filmmakers from around new york and yale.   we filmed it in one day in november...i wrote the script and michael directed the video. blake\, who plays the angel\, is also on the cover of the first dolls' album "a is for accident"...looking very different in a long red dress.  so many people loaned us stuff and worked for free on this video to keep us under budget - THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH.  x afp ________________  FULL CREDITS & THANK YOUS...  song by NIRVANA  starring CHRISTOPHER M.

COL title VAL Wagon Wheel COL performer VAL Darius Rucker	COL video title VAL Юрий Гуляев - Журавли (запись 1974 года\, винил) COL channel name VAL Бешеный Карпыч COL description VAL ЖУРАВЛИ - эта настоящая великая песня Юрия Гуляева\, обречённая на вечное сравнивание. На этот раз с Марком Бернесом - её первым исполнителем\, да и по сути соучастником её создания. С тем самым Безумным Марком\, который два года выпестывал текст этой песни\, сражаясь за каждое слово... Нет\, не с поэтом Гамзатовым\, чей аварский оригинал\, в подстрочном переводе\, кстати\, очень даже хорош. Настоящий бой шёл с неуступчивым поэтом-переводчиком Наумом Гребнёвым\, вот где коса нашла на камень. Наум Гребнёв - поэт с жестокой фронтовой судьбой\, встретивший войну ещё под Брестом\, затем бои через всю Украину\, страшный харьковский котёл\, из которого он\, один из немногих\, сумел вырваться. Потом бои за Сталинград\, три ранения и прочая\, прочая\, прочая... Так что текст ЖУРАВЛЕЙ пропитан подлинным горем войны\, может поэтому эта песня оказывает такое воздействие на людей даже сегодня. Что же касается сравнения Гуляева и Бернеса в этой песне\, то хочется сказать одно - петь можно не только прямым голосом\, но и послезвучием\, остановкой\, длительностью паузы\, просто дыханием в микрофон. И сравнивая Гуляева и Бернеса в ЖУРАВЛЯХ\, приходишь к парадоксальному выводу\, что именно эти два исполнения наиболее внутренне похожи\, даже практически одинаковы. И это при всём различии вокальных техник. Поэтому\, для себя я давно решил\, здесь явная ничья. Возможно\, размер сердец у обоих певцов оказался одинаковым.

This ranks among Dion's best stuff\, and everyone out there ought to dig this track! There are lots of versions of this song out there by many different artists\, but this is the best one I have heard of all of them. I will admit that for the sake of having a good sounding copy\, i swiped the audio off of the cd version so it is the album length rather than the single edit\, but i rarely do something like that for my videos. At least you know you'll be getting what you hear if you go out and buy this on cd! You can hear killer tunes like this one live every night on www.topshelfoldies.com!	0

COL title VAL Rock and Roll Lullaby COL performer VAL The Belmonts	COL video title VAL ALBERT HAMMOND - When you tell me that you love me -Class Master- -demo unplugged- COL channel name VAL Jose Luis Montecristo COL description VAL Sir Albert Hammond (nombrado Oficial de Honor de la Orden del Imperio Británico por la Reina Isabel II de Inglaterra por su aportación al mundo de la música) ha vendido más de 360 millones de discos en todo el mundo con sus canciones\, interpretadas por él mismo y por otros grandes artistas de la talla de Julio Iglesias\, Willie Nelson\, Whitney Houston\, Diana Ross\, Luz Casal\, Starhip... Las canciones de Albert Hammond han liderado las listas de éxitos internacionales tanto de pop como de R&B\, country\, de estilo "adult contemporary" y de música latina\, con frecuencia de manera simultánea. Entre esas canciones se incluyen conocidos números 1 como "When I Need You"\, "Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now" (nominada a los Oscar®\, los Globos de Oro y los Grammy)\, "One Moment in Time" y "To All the Girls I've Loved Before". Auténticos himnos musicales como "One Moment in  Time"\, una canción que compuso para que se convirtiera en el tema oficial de los Juegos Olímpicos en 1988 y que llevó a Albert a recibir su primer Emmy\, y "Cantaré\, Cantarás" (el equivalente en el mercado de música en español del clásico "We Are the World")\, un tema que Albert co-escribió y produjo\, son dos ejemplos de la capacidad de Albert Hammond para componer canciones que se instalan desde el principio en el inconsciente colectivo de millones de personas.  Albert es un experto colaborador con un gran talento con la guitarra\, el piano y la interpretación vocal\, y ha formado  parte de algunos de los equipos de compositores con mayor éxito en la industria discográfica. Junto a su colega en labores de composición Mike Hazlewood\, con el que ha trabajado durante muchos años\, ha co-escrito muchos de sus éxitos\, entre ellos el clásico "The Air that I Breathe". Además\, Albert ha co-escrito grandes temas de éxito junto a Diane Warren\, entre ellos el famoso "I Don't Wanna Live Without Your Love" de Chicago\, "Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now" de Starship\, "Careless Heart" de Roy Orbison\, "Don't You Love Me Anymore" de Joe Cocker y "Don't Turn Around"\, una canción que ha alcanzado el éxito en tres ocasiones en las voces de Ace of Base\, Neil Diamond y el grupo Aswad. Asimismo\, Albert también ha compuesto  diversos éxitos junto a Hal David ("99 Miles from L.A." y "To All the Girls I've Loved Before") y John Bettis ("One Moment  in Time"\, "When You Tell Me That You Love Me" y "I Need To Be In Love"\, el gran éxito que popularizó el grupo The  Carpenters).  Entre las estrellas que han grabado canciones compuestas por Albert Hammond se encuentran muchos de los artistas más importantes del panorama musical contemporáneo\, incluyendo a Celine Dion\, Whitney Houston\, Aretha Franklin\, Tina Turner\, Elton John\, Joe Cocker\, Diana Ross\, Johnny Cash\, K.D. Lang\, Julio Iglesias y Josh Groban\, entre otros grandes nombres.  En 2008 Albert recibió la invitación para incorporarse al prestigioso Songwriter's Hall of Fame\, y también ha recibido la Orden del Imperio Británico (OBE) de manos de Su Majestad la Reina Isabel II de Inglaterra. Gibraltar\, la ciudad donde creció\, ofrecerá próximamente un homenaje a Albert Hammond a través de la edición de una serie de sellos postales conmemorativos que incluirán su imagen y destacarán asimismo sus mayores éxitos internacionales.	0

COL title VAL Märk hur vår skugga COL performer VAL Pia Fridhill	COL video title VAL Cornelis Vreeswijk - Epistel 81 COL channel name VAL Tjerk T. COL description VAL Cornelis Vreeswijk - Epistel 81  Mijn favoriete troubadour uit de 70-er jaren: Cornelis Vreeswijk werd in 1937 in IJmuiden geboren als oudste van vier kinderen. In 1948\, Cornelis was toen elf jaar oud\, verhuisde het gezin naar Stockholm in Zweden waar zijn vader\, Jacob Cornelis Vreeswijk\, nadat hij in Nederland een taxi- en garagebedrijf had gehad\, ging werken als automonteur. Het gezin remigreerde in 1961 naar Nederland\, maar Cornelis en zijn zuster Ida bleven in Zweden wonen.  Vreeswijk debuteerde in 1964 met Ballader och oförskämdheter (Ballades en onbeschaamdheden). Zijn grote doorbraak kwam in 1968 met Tio vackra visor och personliga Person (Tien mooie liederen en 'persoonlijke Person'\, een woordspeling op een Zweedse achternaam). Hij nam ook liederen op van Carl Michael Bellman (1740-1795\, een Zweeds dichter) en Evert Taube (1890 - 1976)\, zijn directe voorganger als belangrijkste Zweedse troubadour.  Ook na zijn dood bleef Vreeswijks oeuvre in Zweden ongekend populair\, getuige ook de nationale Cornelis Vreeswijkdag aldaar.  Vreeswijk werd in 1966 door de VARA uitgenodigd naar Nederland te komen. Een single van De nozem en de non flopte. Zes jaar later verscheen zijn elpee Cornelis Vreeswijk (1972) die bekroond werd met platina; er werden honderdduizend exemplaren van verkocht. Zijn volgende Nederlandstalige platen hadden echter maar weinig succes.  In 1973 verscheen zijn LP I stället för vykort (In plaats van ansichtkaarten)\, waarop hij stelling nam tegen de oorlog in Vietnam. Teksten van Victor Jara werden door hem in 1978 op de plaat gezet.  In 1974 reikte Prins Adrianus I van carnavalsvereniging de Pintenwippers uit IJmuiden aan Vreeswijk het grootkruis der Pintenwippers uit.  In 1985 werd bij Vreeswijk leverkanker geconstateerd. Hij stierf twee jaar later op 50-jarige leeftijd	1

Eddie Kendricks\, Melvin Franklin\, Otis Williams and Paul Williams are brothers of misery singing out the storm warning of failed love just around the bend.  A chorus keeping their emotions in check until they come to that hook line:  "Losing You-oooo"  where the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end...  David Ruffin.  The poor man is in so much anguish and yet his vocals never go completely off the rails.  The amazing thing about David and company is how much emotion they pack into those lyrics while keeping the singing just one step away from total abandon.  Economy in vocalizing\, not "over-singing"; sometimes it's those tightly controlled vocals that tear your guts out- you get the feeling the man is about to combust at any moment and you're just waiting for the other shoe to drop...	0

The record was released in June 1979 on Optional Music with "The Man with the Dogs" as the b-side. The title track was re-recorded for the band's first album\, Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables (1980)\, and the version that appeared on this single\, as well as the single's b-side\, are available on the rarities album Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death (1987).  The lyrics were written by Jello Biafra and John Greenway\, and Biafra composed the music in one of his rare attempts at composing on bass.  This song was featured in the video game Tony Hawk's American Wasteland and as a downloadable song in the Rock Band series. It is also sampled in a song by the dance-punk/big beat trio The Prodigy\, "Dead Ken Beats". The song was also featured in the 2010 film The Social Network.  Meaning  The title is an allusion to the first (and no longer sung) stanza of the national anthem of Germany\, which begins with the words "Deutschland\, Deutschland über alles." (literally\, "Germany\, Germany above all.")  The song focuses on Jerry Brown\, the Governor of California 1975-1983 and 2011--present\, and is sung from his perspective. An imaginary Brown outlines a hippie-fascist vision for America\, in which his "suede denim secret police" kill un-cool people with "organic poison gas" chambers. Lines such as "Serpent's egg already hatched" (a reference to a line from William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar) comment on the corrosive nature of power. The line "now it is 1984" refers to the totalitarian regime of George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four\, describing a future (from 1979) where Jerry Brown has become President Brown presiding over secret police and gas chambers.  Cover versions  Blue Ribbon Glee Club regularly perform their version of the song.  The song was updated by The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy when they released a cover version in 1992 on the album Hypocrisy is the Greatest Legacy. They replaced references to Jerry Brown with references to Pete Wilson.  The song was also widely known in Poland (as "Kalifornia Ponad Wszystko") thanks to the cover by Polish rocker Kazik Staszewski with his band Kazik Na Żywo.  Hasidic New Wave perform a remake of the song on their 1999 album\, Kabalogy. In their version\, titled "Giuliani Über Alles"\, Jerry Brown is replaced by former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani.  The Delgados cover the song in their Peel Sessions CD set.  Six Feet Under do a cover the song on their Graveyard Classics album.  The black metal band Mayhem also covered the song.  Deceased covered the song on their punk covers album Rotten to the Core.  The hardcore band Ceremony has covered the song.  The Who Boys have done a mashup of "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" by Gil Scott-Heron called "Revolution Über Alles".  John Linnell and his band The Statesmen covered it live at least once during his "State Songs" tour\, choosing to perform it because it mentioned the state of California.  Dramarama has recorded a version\, updated in 2003 about California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger... "You will lift weights in school".  A 1986 live recording focused on Ronald Reagan on the album Mutiny On The Bay with live recordings from 1982 and 1986.  Jayne County covered the song with She Wolves about California's Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The green vinyl single was released under artist name Jayne County Meets The She Wolves by the German label Trash 2001.  Mexican death metal band Brujería covers Dead Kennedys with the song "California Uber Aztlan" in 2010.	0

I love the music of Clarence White & decided it was time to put some out. It's a great listen & was made as learning tapes to be given as gifts to his friends. It was found after his sudden death at age 29\, killed by a drunk driver. This was a tape\, recorded by Ry Cooder in White's home in early tape days. He was with The Byrds\, The New KY Colonels\, backed Emmylou & Gram\, Jackson Browne\, The Everly Bros\,the supergroup Muleskinner (look up the members)\, Gene Watston\,Arlo Guthrie...almost anyone who was playing good music at the time. Many believe he would have been the crossover giant in music if not for his untimely death. He steered clear of drugs & booze. Tony Rice & Marty Stuart bought 2 of his guitars due to their respect for him. Enjoy!	0

COL title VAL Pink Moon COL performer VAL Nick Drake	COL video title VAL INEZ FOXX-i stand accuse COL channel name VAL pieroangelo2 COL description VAL Charlie Foxx (October 23\, 1939 -- September 18\, 1998) and his sister Inez Foxx (born September 9\, 1942) were an African-American rhythm and blues and soul duo from Greensboro\, North Carolina. Inez sang lead vocal\, while Charlie sang back-up and played guitar.[1]   Their most successful record was with their novelty composition\, "Mockingbird". Released in 1963\, it made the Top 10 on both the rhythm and blues and pop charts; the song was later covered by artists including Aretha Franklin\, James Taylor\, Carly Simon\, Dusty Springfield and Toby Keith. Other notable recordings were "Hurt by Love\," "Ask Me\," and "(1-2-3-4-5-6-7) Count the Days."   They were known for their exciting live performances\, of which a highlight was Inez's rendition of "I Stand Accused"\, which finished with a supposedly distraught Inez singing the last verse\, while being carried offstage by Charlie. They toured extensively in Europe and their music played a key role in the development of the Northern Soul movement.   Inez also had some success recording on her own\, beginning in 1969\, but her popularity faded in the 1970s. Charlie was already working as a record producer when they finally disbanded their act.   Inez Foxx was married to the American songwriter and producer Luther Dixon. Together they wrote\, and he produced\, The Platters' mid-1960s return to hit-making with the single "I Love You 1000 Times".[2] Luther Dixon produced Inez and Charlie's 1967 album Come By Here\, but the couple later divorced.[2]   Charlie Foxx died from leukemia in 1998\, at the age of 58.	0

Her infectious spirit\, impeccable musicality\, and sheer joy in her faith are obvious in every recording and are a source of great inspiration.  http://www.rhiannongiddens.com/ http://www.twitter.com/rhiannongiddens http://www.instagram.com/rhiannongiddens http://www.facebook.com/RhiannonGiddensMusic	0

COL title VAL (I Know) I'm Losing You COL performer VAL Rare Earth	COL video title VAL the temptations- i know i'm losing you COL channel name VAL Motown Deep Cuts\, PAMS Jingles & More with Tomovox COL description VAL A cold day in Hell...  The horrifying ring of truth- what it feels like to know you're losing someone you love...  Eddie Kendricks\, Melvin Franklin\, Otis Williams and Paul Williams are brothers of misery singing out the storm warning of failed love just around the bend.  A chorus keeping their emotions in check until they come to that hook line:  "Losing You-oooo"  where the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end...  David Ruffin.  The poor man is in so much anguish and yet his vocals never go completely off the rails.  The amazing thing about David and company is how much emotion they pack into those lyrics while keeping the singing just one step away from total abandon.  Economy in vocalizing\, not "over-singing"; sometimes it's those tightly controlled vocals that tear your guts out- you get the feeling the man is about to combust at any moment and you're just waiting for the other shoe to drop...	1

Click here for more Madness: https://madnessband.lnk.to/bestofID  British band Madness had a major UK hit with this song in 1981\, and with good reason: heartfelt and nutty in equal measure it still brings the house down at every Madness show.

COL title VAL Tie Your Mother Down COL performer VAL Queen	COL video title VAL FOUR UNTIL LATE (1937) by Robert Johnson COL channel name VAL wilson mcphert COL description VAL I first heard 'Four Until Late' sung by Eric Clapton on the Fresh Cream album. It was one of the first songs I learned on guitar\, and one I still like doing.  .   Robert Johnson\, of course\, was the author of the song (although clearly influenced by Blind Blake's 'Georgia Bound'- see my video). In 1937\, he travelled to Dallas\, Texas\, for his second and final recording session in a makeshift studio at the Brunswick Record Building\, 508 Park Avenue. He recorded this song on 19 June 1937.   It goes without saying that Johnson was one of the most influential blues singers in history. Wikipedia has a substantial profile on him.   There are only two photos of Johnson that I know of\, and I have used these and others to make a slideshow video.   Comments are welcome.	0

The record was released in June 1979 on Optional Music with "The Man with the Dogs" as the b-side. The title track was re-recorded for the band's first album\, Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables (1980)\, and the version that appeared on this single\, as well as the single's b-side\, are available on the rarities album Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death (1987).  The lyrics were written by Jello Biafra and John Greenway\, and Biafra composed the music in one of his rare attempts at composing on bass.  This song was featured in the video game Tony Hawk's American Wasteland and as a downloadable song in the Rock Band series. It is also sampled in a song by the dance-punk/big beat trio The Prodigy\, "Dead Ken Beats". The song was also featured in the 2010 film The Social Network.  Meaning  The title is an allusion to the first (and no longer sung) stanza of the national anthem of Germany\, which begins with the words "Deutschland\, Deutschland über alles." (literally\, "Germany\, Germany above all.")  The song focuses on Jerry Brown\, the Governor of California 1975-1983 and 2011--present\, and is sung from his perspective. An imaginary Brown outlines a hippie-fascist vision for America\, in which his "suede denim secret police" kill un-cool people with "organic poison gas" chambers. Lines such as "Serpent's egg already hatched" (a reference to a line from William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar) comment on the corrosive nature of power. The line "now it is 1984" refers to the totalitarian regime of George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four\, describing a future (from 1979) where Jerry Brown has become President Brown presiding over secret police and gas chambers.  Cover versions  Blue Ribbon Glee Club regularly perform their version of the song.  The song was updated by The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy when they released a cover version in 1992 on the album Hypocrisy is the Greatest Legacy. They replaced references to Jerry Brown with references to Pete Wilson.  The song was also widely known in Poland (as "Kalifornia Ponad Wszystko") thanks to the cover by Polish rocker Kazik Staszewski with his band Kazik Na Żywo.  Hasidic New Wave perform a remake of the song on their 1999 album\, Kabalogy. In their version\, titled "Giuliani Über Alles"\, Jerry Brown is replaced by former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani.  The Delgados cover the song in their Peel Sessions CD set.  Six Feet Under do a cover the song on their Graveyard Classics album.  The black metal band Mayhem also covered the song.  Deceased covered the song on their punk covers album Rotten to the Core.  The hardcore band Ceremony has covered the song.  The Who Boys have done a mashup of "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" by Gil Scott-Heron called "Revolution Über Alles".  John Linnell and his band The Statesmen covered it live at least once during his "State Songs" tour\, choosing to perform it because it mentioned the state of California.  Dramarama has recorded a version\, updated in 2003 about California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger... "You will lift weights in school".  A 1986 live recording focused on Ronald Reagan on the album Mutiny On The Bay with live recordings from 1982 and 1986.  Jayne County covered the song with She Wolves about California's Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The green vinyl single was released under artist name Jayne County Meets The She Wolves by the German label Trash 2001.  Mexican death metal band Brujería covers Dead Kennedys with the song "California Uber Aztlan" in 2010.	1

COL title VAL Sugaree COL performer VAL Johnny Winter	COL video title VAL Squid Jigging Ground COL channel name VAL Standard Ranch Stash COL description VAL I’ve always loved this track\, taken from George Hamilton IV’s Down East Country album. It’s history\, below\, is new to me but I’ve always wondered about squid jigging!  (From: http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca)  This account of high jinks on the squid-fishing grounds is one of Newfoundland's best-known songs. Its words were written by the 15-year-old Arthur Scammell in 1928 as a high-school project.  This account of high jinks on the squid-fishing grounds is one of Newfoundland's best-known songs. Its words were written by the 15-year-old Arthur Scammell in 1928 as a high-school project. Squid jigging\, in which a jigger\, an un-baited\, lined hook\, is submerged in water and jerked upwards to grasp the arms of squid and flip them into boats\, was a common practice in Scammell's hometown of Change Islands. Published in Gerald Doyle's Old-Time Songs and Poetry of Newfoundland (second edition\, 1940)\, the song was copyrighted by Scammell in 1944\, was issued as sheet music by BMI Canada\, and appeared later in other folksong collections. Scammell's widely successful 1943 recording of "Squid Jiggin' Ground" is regarded as the first commercial recording of a Newfoundland folk song. The song has been subsequently recorded by Omar Blondahl\, George Hamilton IV\, Harry Hibbs\, Ed McCurdy\, Alan Mills\, Dick Nolan\, Hank Snow\, the Travellers\, the Irish Rovers\, and others. The tune was played on the Peace Tower carillon in Ottawa to mark the entry of Newfoundland into the confederation of Canada in 1949. In 2011 the song was inducted into the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame. Its lyrics\, which were adapted to an Irish fiddle tune\, "Larry O'Gaff\," depict the squid-jigging activities of local fisherman:  . A. R. Scammell\, Squid Jiggin' Ground Copyright 1944  Oh... this is the place where the fishermen gather With oil-skins and boots and Cape Anns battened down All sizes of figures with squid lines and jiggers They congregate here on the squid-jiggin' ground.  Some are workin' their jiggers while others are yarnin' There's some standin' up and there's more lyin' down While all kinds of fun\, jokes and tricks are begun As they wait for the squid on the squid-jiggin' ground.  There's men of all ages and boys in the bargain There's old Billy Cave and there's young Raymond Brown There's a red rantin' Tory out here in the dory A-runnin' down Squires on the squid-jiggin' ground.  There's men from the Harbour and men from the Tickle In all kinds of motorboats... green\, grey and brown Right yonder is Bobby and with him is Nobby He's chewin' hard tack on the squid-jiggin' ground.   The man with the whiskers is old Jacob Steele He's gettin' well up but he's still pretty sound While Uncle Bob Hawkins wears six pairs of stockin's Whenever he's out on the squid-jiggin' ground.  God bless my sou'wester\, there's Skipper John Chaffey He's the best hand at squid-jiggin' here\, I'll be bound Hello! What's the row? Why\, he's jiggin' one now The very first squid on the squid-jiggin' ground.  Holy smoke! What a scuffle! All hands are excited 'Tis a wonder to me that there's nobody drowned There's a bustle\, confusion\, a wonderful hustle They're all jiggin' squid on the squid-jiggin' ground.  Says Bobby\, "The squids are on top of the water\, I just got me jigger 'bout one fathom down" When a squid in the boat squirted right down his throat And he's swearin' like mad on the squid-jiggin' ground.  There's poor Uncle Bille\, his whiskers are spattered With spots of the squid juice that's flyin' around; One poor little b'y got it right in the eye But they don't give a damn on the squid-jiggin' ground.  Now if ever you feel inclined to go squiddin' Leave your white shirts and collars behind in the town And if you get cranky without yer silk hanky You'd better steer clear of the squid-jiggin' ground.	0

COL title VAL Echidna's Arf (Of You) COL performer VAL Meridian Arts Ensemble	COL video title VAL LUTHER INGRAM-ain't hat loving you(for more reason than one) COL channel name VAL pieroangelo2 COL description VAL Born Luther Thomas Ingram in Jackson\, Tennessee\, his early interest in music led to him making his first record in 1965 at the age of 28. His first three recordings failed to chart but that changed when he signed for KoKo Records in the late 1960s\, and his first hit "My Honey And Me" peaked at #55 on the Hot 100 on 14 February 1970. Many of his songs appeared in the pop and R&B charts\, even though Koko was only a small label\, owned by his manager and record producer\, Johnny Baylor. Koko and Baylor were closely associated with the Memphis based Stax Records label during the height of its commercial success.   Ingram is best known for the hit\, "(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want to Be Right"\, written by Homer Banks\, Carl Hampton and Raymond Jackson. The song reached number one on Billboard 's R&B chart and peaked at number three on that publication's Hot 100 chart in the summer of 1972. The track stayed in the Hot 100 for 18 weeks\, ultimately selling a reported four million copies.[1] The song was later successfully covered by Millie Jackson and Barbara Mandrell; it has also been recorded by Bobby "Blue" Bland\, Rod Stewart and Isaac Hayes.   Other popular tracks for Ingram included "Ain't That Loving You (For More Reasons Than One)"\, "Let's Steal Away To The Hideaway" and "I'll Be Your Shelter." He also co-authored "Respect Yourself"\, a million seller for the Staples Singers in 1971.[1] The acetate demo version of Ingram's\, "Exus Trek"\, became a sought after Northern soul track.[2] With the Stax connections\, Ingram recorded at the Memphis label's studios\, as well as other southern-based studios such as Muscle Shoals. He was opening act for Isaac Hayes for some years\, and often used Hayes' Movement band and female backing group for his 1970s recordings. He recorded into the 1980s\, and whilst only managing lower R&B chart hits\, he remained a popular stage draw.   Ingram died on March 19\, 2007\, at a Belleville\, Illinois\, hospital of heart failure. According to his wife Jacqui Ingram\, he had suffered for years from diabetes\, kidney disease and partial blindness	0

La sua chitarra mi regalò\, fu richiamato in America.  Stop! Coi Rolling Stones! Stop! Coi Beatles stop! M'han detto "va nel Viet-nam e spara ai Viet-cong" tatatatatatatatata...  C'era un ragazzo che come me amava i Beatles e i Rolling Stones\, girava il mondo e poi finì a far la guerra nel Viet-Nam.  Capelli lunghi non porta giù\, non suona la chitarra ma uno strumento che sempre dà la stessa nota "ta-ra-ta-ta". Non ha più amici\, non ha più fans\, vede la gente cadere giù\, nel suo paese non tornerà\, adesso è morto nel Viet-Nam.  Stop! Coi Rolling Stones! Stop! Coi Beatles\, stop! Nel petto un cuore più non ha\, ma due medaglie o tre... tatatatatatatatatatata...	0

COL title VAL Head Like a Hole COL performer VAL Pig	COL video title VAL Head Like A Hole by Justin McRoberts with Lyrics COL channel name VAL ribenamama COL description VAL This is my very first youtube video and lyric video. ♥  I hope I didn't do a terrible job on this one\, given that it's my very first time (!)  Squee~  I love this song so so so so so so so so much. And very few people seem to know about it\, so I thought I'd make this.  If the lyrics sound familiar\, it's because this is actually a partial cover (?) to Head Like A Hole by Nine Inch Nails. The melody is different.  I modified the lyrics for this video from http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/2508/ and the beautiful picture is from http://snakeplaya24.deviantart.com/art/space-67540954. The font used is Little Sparrow. Hope you enjoy this! ♥  P.S.

She's also an author: she wrote for Mario Biondi on the albums 'Handful of soul' and 'I love you more'\, she co-wrote most of the songs on the Papik album 'Rhythm of life'\, together with her producer Nerio Poggi (aka Papik)\, including 'Staying for Good'\, the single from the album that's getting a great response worldwide. This is her first album under her own name and it's dedicated to remakes in a soul-jazz style of tunes from the 80's and 90's. Among the songs chosen: a bossa cover of 'Rhythm of the night' by Corona and an R&B version of 'Barbie Girl'. But the self-penned '1986' is the real gem on this album!

He was born in West Point\, Mississippi in an area now known as White Station. With a booming voice and looming physical presence\, Burnett is commonly ranked among the leading performers in electric blues; musician and critic Cub Koda declared\, "no one could match Howlin' Wolf for the singular ability to rock the house down to the foundation while simultaneously scaring its patrons out of its wits." A number of songs written or popularized by Burnett—such as "Smokestack Lightnin'"\, "Back Door Man"\, "Killing Floor" and "Spoonful"—have become blues and blues rock standards.

It is London's trademark for the most advanced and flexible of all stereo recording techniques; it stands for motion and an uncanny sense of spatial realism unapproached by conventional disc standards; it is your assurance of unmatched quality control\, rigorously applied from studio to finished disc\, throughout every single step of the manufacturing process. Perhaps the most remarkable innovation of "phase 4" is the use of London's custom built 20 channel console mixer. This complex and forbidding-looking machine permits sounds from no less than twenty separate sources to be combined and blended in precise perspective. Each instrument can be pinpointed at exact locations from extreme left to extreme right along the horizontal plane\, or forward and back through an astonishingly large depth of field. This\, of course\, is only part of the "phase 4" story. The making of the master tape\, the cutting of the master lacquer disc\, production of the final copy for the consumer -all are done with custom equipment\, under the constant supervision of both engineers and musicians. The statement that the 500\,000th record produced is identical in sound performance with the very first copy pressed is no idle boast: it is part of the  unique and proud credo of "phase 4 stereo". »   Phase4Stereo :  Please use as a series only\, adding it together with the Decca or London Records labels. The mono parallel series and technique was Sound 4. Phase 4 Stereo was a series created in 1961\, supposedly for better sound\, by being recorded on a 10-channel\, and later 20-channel\, recording console. Approximately 200 LPs were released under this branch\, including popular music\, "gimmick" records engineered to make the sound travel from speaker to speaker\, records featuring percussion effects\, and historical sound-effect records. In 1964\, a light-classical Phase 4 Stereo Concert  Series was produced.	0

This song was a #1 hit for Ernest Hare and Billy Jones in 1921. Original Billboard review: "Carr turns in a real zingy coverage of the sleeper piano instrumental revival which has hit via Del Wood's reading on Tennessee label. Similar to the original and could catch a piece. Rated 81 out of 100".  Written by L. Wolfe Gilbert.   B-side is "Ivory Rag" by Joe "Fingers" Carr and the Carr-Hops.	0

When questioned who had sent for him\,  He answered with his thumb\,  For his tongue it could not speak\, but only flatter.   He stayed behind the assembly hall\,  It was there he made his bed\,  Oftentimes he could be seen returning.  Until one day he just appeared  With a note in his hand which read\,  "The soles of my feet\, I swear they're burning."   Oh\, the leaves began to fallin'  And the seas began to part\,  And the people that confronted him were many.  And he was told but these few words\,  Which opened up his heart\,  "If ye cannot bring good news\, then don't bring any."   I do not own this. All rights belong to the respective owners.	0

Between 1968 and 1970 a number of other singers had significant hits with her songs: The 5th Dimension with "Blowing Away"\, "Wedding Bell Blues"\, "Stoned Soul Picnic"\, "Sweet Blindness"\, "Save The Country" and "Black Patch"; Blood\, Sweat & Tears and Peter\, Paul & Mary with "And When I Die"; Three Dog Night with "Eli's Coming"; and Barbra Streisand with "Stoney End"\, "Time and Love"\, and "Hands off the Man (Flim Flam Man)".

Lyrics:  Loving you so I was too blind to see you letting me go But now that you've set me free It's gonna take a miracle Yes\, it's gonna take a miracle To make me love someone new Cause I'm crazy for you  Oh oh\, didn't you know It wouldn't be so easy lettin' you go I could have told you that it's gonna take a miracle  oh-uh Yes\, it's gonna take a miracle To make me love someone new Cause I'm crazy for you  Oh\, tho' I know I can't forget? about you or come so? will show you how much You're turning me around\, destroying me I'll never be the same anymore  You must realize You took your love and left me Quite by surprise You can be sure that now it's gonna take a miracle Yes\, it's gonna take a miracle To make me love someone new Cause I'm crazy for you	0

Her infectious spirit\, impeccable musicality\, and sheer joy in her faith are obvious in every recording and are a source of great inspiration.  http://www.rhiannongiddens.com/ http://www.twitter.com/rhiannongiddens http://www.instagram.com/rhiannongiddens http://www.facebook.com/RhiannonGiddensMusic	0

In June 1987 Gerald Arthur Friend picked up a 14-year-old female friend after leaving a concert at the Tacoma Dome.

COL title VAL Blue Side of Lonesome COL performer VAL John Prine & Mac Wiseman	COL video title VAL Bob Luman - Early in The Morning (1958) COL channel name VAL AugieBurr COL description VAL Bob Luman on His 4th appearence on Town Hall Party at 1958.  ---ABOUT THE SONG--- "Early In The Morning" [US #24 - 1958] was a song written and recorded by Bobby Darin for Brunswick Records\, but as Darin was still under contract to Atlantic Records' subsidiary\, Atco\, the song was released by "The Ding Dongs". New York deejays liked the record and Atco soon discovered the deception. Brunswick was forced to turn over the masters to Atco which released the record under the name "The Rinky Dinks".  --- ABOUT THE ARTIST--- Bob Luman recieved his early musical influence in Nacogdoches\, Texas\, as his father was an amateur fiddle\, guitar and harmonica player.  In 1956\, he won a talent contest which earned him an appearance on the Louisiana Hayride. For the Hayride\, Luman formed a backup band called the Shadows. In 1957\, the band signed with Imperial Records\, where they recorded "All Night Long" and "Amarillo Blues".That same year\, the band appeared for the first time on the Town Hall Party in Los Angeles\, and appeared in the movie Carnival Rock. In 1958\, dropped by Imperial Records\, Luman signed with Capitol Records\, where he released "Try Me" and "I Know My Baby Cares." Capitol Records wanted Luman to change his name\, which he refused to do\, so he left the record label and signed with Warner Bros. Records\, recording "Class of '59" and "Loretta". In 1960\, Luman was drafted into the United States Army. It was while still in the Army that Warner Bros. Records released Luman's best-known crossover hit\, "Let's Think About Living\," a novelty song that hit #7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and #9 on the Billboard country music chart. After leaving the Army in 1962\, Luman moved to Nashville\, where he married. In 1965\, he joined the Grand Ole Opry. Luman toured frequently in the 60s and 70s\, and became popular in Las Vegas\, with an act which combined country and rockabilly. He signed with Epic Records in 1968\, and had several hits with them\, including "Still Loving You" and "Lonely Women Make Good Lovers" -his biggest country hit\, hitting #4 on the country chart. Luman's other country hits included "Ain't Got Time To Be Unhappy" (1968)\, "Ballad of Two Brothers" (with Autry Inman\, 1968)\, "When You Say Love" (1972)\, "Neither One Of Us (Wants To Be The First To Say Goodbye)" (1973)\, "Proud Of You Baby" (1975)\, and "The Pay Phone" (1977). Luman died in Nashville of pneumonia in 1978\, at the age of forty-one. After his death\, Bear Family Records released several compilations of his songs\, including More of the Rocker\, Still Rockin' and Carnival Rock. Luman is a member of both the Rockabilly Hall of Fame and the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame.  source: www.wikipedia.org	0

Purchase from the label: http://www.paradiseofbachelors.com/shop/pob-21 Purchase from Bandcamp: https://paradiseofbachelors.bandcamp.com/album/ambsace Other options: http://lnk.to/PoB21  The second album of astonishing duets by guitarists James Elkington (who has toured and/or recorded with Jeff Tweedy\, Richard Thompson\, and Steve Gunn\, among others) and Nathan Salsburg (an accomplished soloist deemed by NPR “one of those names we’ll all associate with American folk guitar”) is a sublime suite of nimble\, filigreed compositions by two singular stylists. Belying its title—“ambsace” is the lowest throw of dice; snake eyes—the record thrives on a gentle empathy and generosity of spirit\, sitting sneakily protean original compositions alongside gorgeous arrangements of songs by Duke Ellington and The Smiths at the same big hand-hewn table.

Autry was also owner of a television station\, several radio stations in Southern California\, and the Los Angeles/California/Anaheim Angels Major League Baseball team from 1961 to 1997.  From 1934 to 1953\, Autry appeared in 93 films and 91 episodes of The Gene Autry Show television series. During the 1930s and 1940s\, he personified the straight-shooting hero—honest\, brave\, and true—and profoundly touched the lives of millions of Americans. Autry was also one of the most important figures in the history of country music\, considered the second major influential artist of the genre's development after Jimmie Rodgers.[2] His singing cowboy movies were the first vehicle to carry country music to a national audience. ] In addition to his signature song\, "Back in the Saddle Again"\, Autry is still remembered for his Christmas holiday songs\, "Here Comes Santa Claus"\, which he wrote\, "Frosty the Snowman"\, and his biggest hit\, "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer".  Autry is a member of both the Country Music Hall of Fame and Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame\, and is the only person to be awarded stars in all five categories on the Hollywood Walk of Fame\, for film\, television\, music\, radio\, and live performance. The town of Gene Autry\, Oklahoma was named in his honor.	0

Join our Youtube: https://goo.gl/8AOGaN Join our Facebook: http://goo.gl/5oL723  Nathaniel Adams Coles (March 17\, 1919 – February 15\, 1965)\, known professionally as Nat King Cole\, was an American singer who first came to prominence as a leading jazz pianist. He was widely noted for his soft baritone voice\, performing in big band and jazz genres\, and was a major force in popular music for three decades. Cole was one of the first African Americans to host a national television variety show\, The Nat King Cole Show. His recordings remained popular worldwide after his death from lung cancer in February 1965. Nathaniel Adams Coles was born in Montgomery\, Alabama\, on March 17\, 1919. He had three brothers—Eddie (1910–1970)\, Ike (1927–2001)\, and Freddy (born 1931)—and a half-sister\, Joyce Coles. Each of his brothers pursued careers in music. When Nat was four years old\, he and his family moved to Chicago\, Illinois\, where his father\, Edward Coles\, became a Baptist minister. Nat learned to play the organ from his mother\, Perlina Coles\, the church organist. His first performance was of "Yes! We Have No Bananas" at the age of four. He began formal lessons at 12 and eventually learned not only jazz and gospel music but also Western classical music; he performed "from Johann Sebastian Bach to Sergei Rachmaninoff." Inspired by the performances of Hines\, Cole began his performing career in the mid-1930s while still a teenager\, adopting the name Nat Cole. His older brother\, Eddie\, a bass player\, soon joined Cole's band\, and they made their first recording in 1936\, under Eddie's name. They also were regular performers in clubs. Cole acquired his nickname\, "King"\, performing at one jazz club\, a nickname presumably reinforced by the otherwise unrelated nursery rhyme about Old King Cole. He was also a pianist in a national tour of Eubie Blake's revue\, Shuffle Along. When it suddenly failed in Long Beach\, California\, Cole decided to remain there. He later returned to Chicago in triumph to play such venues as the Edgewater Beach Hotel. Cole and two other musicians formed the "King Cole Swingsters" in Long Beach and played in a number of local bars before getting a gig on the Long Beach Pike for US $90.00 per week ($1\,535 in 2015). The trio consisted of Cole on piano\, Oscar Moore on guitar\, and Wesley Prince on double bass. The trio played in Failsworth through the late 1930s and recorded many radio transcriptions for Capitol Transcriptions. Cole was the pianist and also the leader of the combo. Radio was important to the King Cole Trio's rise in popularity. Their first broadcast was with NBC's Blue Network in 1938. It was followed by performances on NBC's Swing Soiree. In the 1940s\, the trio appeared on the radio shows Old Gold\, The Chesterfield Supper Club and Kraft Music Hall. The King Cole Trio performed twice on CBS Radio's variety show The Orson Welles Almanac in 1944. Cole was inducted into the Alabama Music Hall of Fame and the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame. He was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1990. He was inducted into the Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame in 1997 and the Hit Parade Hall of Fame in 2007. A United States postage stamp featuring Cole's likeness was issued in 1994. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000\, as a major influence on early rock and roll\, and the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2013\, for his contribution to Latin music. Cole's success at Capitol Records\, for which he recorded more than 150 singles that reached the Billboard Pop\, R&B\, and Country charts\, has yet to be matched by any Capitol artist. his records sold 50 million copies during his career. His recording of "The Christmas Song" still receives airplay every holiday season. FROM WIKIPEDIA: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_King_Cole	0

COL title VAL The Book of Love COL performer VAL Patricia O'Callaghan	COL video title VAL 'Something in the Air' - new version by The Luck of Eden Hall (originally by Thunderclap Newman) COL channel name VAL FruitsdeMer2 COL description VAL 'Something In The Air' pretty much sums up UK pop psych in the sixties for me  - Speedy Kean wrote it\, Thunderclap Newman gave up his post round to play on it\, Pete Townsend produced it (and maybe played bass on it). Now The Luck of Eden Hall give it a Chicago psych rock feel and produce something pretty special along the way - nice one\, Curvey.  The Luck of Eden Hall will be familiar to followers of Fruits de Mer\, and 'Something' doesn't disappoint.

In retrospect\, it would have appeared that the Souls  may have been a decade ahead of time\, b'cos head today\, Live On sounds amazingly current with it's mix of roots\, funk\, soul\, jazz and pop \, and while it is true that it might be the least Jamaicans sounding of their albums\, with pedigree of crack island session players like Sly & Robbie\, Dwight Pinkney\, Sticky Thompson and Earl Lindo all over the tracks..."	0

Hurt)  Recorded: New York City\, December 28\,1928 Mississippi John Hurt (vcl)(g).  Born John Smith Hurt in Teoc\,  Carroll County\, Mississippi and raised in Avalon\, Mississippi\, Hurt learned to play guitar at age 9. He spent much of his youth playing old time music for friends and dances\, earning a living as a farm hand into the 1920s. In 1923 he partnered with the fiddle player Willie Narmour as a substitute for his regular partner Shell Smith. When Narmour got a chance to record for Okeh Records as a prize for winning first place in a 1928 fiddle contest\, Narmour recommended John Hurt to Okeh Records producer Tommy Rockwell. After auditioning "Monday Morning Blues" at his home\, he took part in two recording sessions\, in Memphis and New York City (see Discography below). The "Mississippi" tag was added by Okeh as a sales gimmick. After the commercial failure of the resulting records\, and Okeh Records going out of business during the Great Depression\, Hurt returned to Avalon and obscurity\, working as a sharecropper and playing local parties and dances.  In 1963\, however\, a folk musicologist\, Tom Hoskins\, inspired by the recordings\, was able to locate Hurt near Avalon\, Mississippi. Seeing that Hurt's guitar playing skills were still intact\, Hoskins encouraged him to move to Washington\, D.C.\, and begin performing on a wider stage. His performance at the 1964 Newport Folk Festival saw his star rise amongst the new folk revival audience. Before his death he played extensively in colleges\, concert halls\, coffee houses and also on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson\, as well as recording three further albums for Vanguard Records. The numbers his devotees particularly liked were the ragtime songs "Salty Dog" and "Candy Man"\, and the blues ballads "Spike Driver Blues" (a variant of "John Henry") and "Frankie".  Hurt's influence spanned several music genres including blues\, country\, bluegrass\, folk and contemporary rock and roll. A soft-spoken man\, his nature was reflected in the work\, which remained a mellow mix of country\, blues and old time music to the end.[7]  Hurt died in November 1966 from a heart attack in Grenada\, Mississippi	1

Towering in gallant fame\, Scotland my mountain hame\, High may your proud standards gloriously wave\, Land of my high endeavour\, Land of the shining river\, Land of my heart for ever\, Scotland the brave.  High in the misty Highlands\, Out by the purple islands\, Brave are the hearts that beat Beneath Scottish skies. Wild are the winds to meet you\, Staunch are the friends that greet you\, Kind as the love that shines from fair maiden's eyes.  Towering in gallant fame\, Scotland my mountain hame\, High may your proud standards gloriously wave\, Land of my high endeavour\, Land of the shining river\, Land of my heart for ever\, Scotland the brave.  Far off in sunlit places\, Sad are the Scottish faces\, Yearning to feel the kiss Of sweet Scottish rain. Where tropic skies are beaming\, Love sets the heart a-dreaming\, Longing and dreaming for the homeland again.  Towering in gallant fame\, Scotland my mountain hame\, High may your proud standards gloriously wave\, Land of my high endeavour\, Land of the shining river\, Land of my heart for ever\, Scotland the brave. Land of my heart for ever\, Scotland the brave.	0

Released as a single in May 1970 (backed by the non-album track "Magic Mountain")\, it was War's first chart hit\, peaking at number three. It was also a top three hit in Canada and Australia. It charted #15 in Netherlands and #28 in Germany.  In 1996\, it was remixed by Junior Vasquez and released as a single again.  Lonnie Jordan said in an 2008 interview that Eric Burdon is the first Latin rapper in pop music.  In the introduction to the live version of the song on Greatest Hits Live\, Lonnie Jordan reveals that the inspiration for the song was a time when he spilled a glass of wine on a mixing board in the recording studio. Eric Burdon found the event funny\, so he and Jordan used it as the inspiration for the song.  Use in film  "Spill the Wine" was used in the popular motion pictures Boogie Nights\, Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo and Remember the Titans.  It was also sung during the The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air episode\, "That's No Lady\, That's My Cousin".  The song can also be heard in the Dexter episode "A Horse of a Different Color"\, while main characters Joey Quinn and Angel Batista are smoking a joint.  Cover versions  The song has been covered by: The Isley Brothers for their 1971 album Givin' It All Back\, as well as by The B-Side Players\, Juan Ma y su Sonido Costeño\, 2NU on their 1989 album Ponderous\, Lalo Schifrin\, Melvin Sparks\, Michael Hutchence\, The Dream Syndicate\, Lighter Shade of Brown\, Los Mocosos and Freaked Out Flower Children.  In 2004\, flautist Alexander Zonjic performed a cover for his album "Seldom Blues."  In 2012\, the revival of the 1970's band The L.A. Carpool\, covered Spill the Wine with a Latin salsa flare. The cover features well known Latin drummer Richie "Gajate" Garcia among many other well known Latin musicians.	0

Era el verano claro está\, y yo empezaba a soñar con mi pasado. Ante un espejo le fingí que maquillaba mi nariz para mirarle. Cuando me vi tan cerca de él había dado no sé qué por conquistarle.  Me sonrió con intención y fue su edad la explicación de su victoria. No quiso hablarme del amor\, pues según él esa cuestión es otra historia. Me dijo tú me vas muy bien\, eres igual que la mujer de "El Graduado". Yo no pude resistir y entre sus brazos descubrí\, un sol dorado.  Dieciocho años nada más eso le hizo ser audaz mas que insolente. Cuando llegué a despertar\, solo sentí la soledad indiferente. Por un momento pretendí el retenerlo junto a mí\, pero no quise. Me dijo no has estado mal\, con un candor tan infernal\, antes de irse. Entonces tuve que fingir que maquillaba mi nariz\, para no verle y estuve a punto de olvidar que yo le doblaba la edad.	0

Lyrics:  Once I was seven years old my mama told me\,  Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely Once I was seven years old  It was a big\, big world but we thought we were bigger Pushing each other to the limits\, we were learning quicker By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor  Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure  Once I was eleven years old my daddy told me\,  Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely Once I was eleven years old  I always had that dream like my daddy before me So I started writing songs\, I started writing stories Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me ‘Cause only those I really love will ever really know me  Once I was twenty years old my story got told Before the morning sun when life was lonely Once I was twenty years old  I only see my goals I don't believe in failure ‘Cause I know the smallest voices they can make it major I got my boys with me\, at least those in favor And if we don't meet before I leave I hope I'll see you later  Once I was twenty years old my story got told  I waswriting 'bout everything I saw before me Once I was twenty years old  Soon we'll be thirty years old\, our songs have been sold  We'vetraveled around the world and we're still roaming Soon we'll be thirty years old  I'm still learning about life\, my woman brought children for me So I can sing them all my songs and I can tell them stories Most of my boys are with me\, some are still out seeking glory And some I had to leave behind\, my brother I'm still sorry  Soon I'll be sixty years old\, my daddy got sixty-one  Remember life and then your life becomes a better one I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month  Soon I'll be sixty years old\, will I think the world is cold Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me Soon I'll be sixty years old  #OfficialMusicVideo #LukasGraham #7Years #WeAreWarnerRecords	1

Autry was also owner of a television station\, several radio stations in Southern California\, and the Los Angeles/California/Anaheim Angels Major League Baseball team from 1961 to 1997.  From 1934 to 1953\, Autry appeared in 93 films and 91 episodes of The Gene Autry Show television series. During the 1930s and 1940s\, he personified the straight-shooting hero—honest\, brave\, and true—and profoundly touched the lives of millions of Americans. Autry was also one of the most important figures in the history of country music\, considered the second major influential artist of the genre's development after Jimmie Rodgers.[2] His singing cowboy movies were the first vehicle to carry country music to a national audience. ] In addition to his signature song\, "Back in the Saddle Again"\, Autry is still remembered for his Christmas holiday songs\, "Here Comes Santa Claus"\, which he wrote\, "Frosty the Snowman"\, and his biggest hit\, "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer".  Autry is a member of both the Country Music Hall of Fame and Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame\, and is the only person to be awarded stars in all five categories on the Hollywood Walk of Fame\, for film\, television\, music\, radio\, and live performance. The town of Gene Autry\, Oklahoma was named in his honor.	0

He came across this young man pickin' on a guitar\, playing it hot an' An' the devil jumped on a hickory stump an' said 'I'll tell ya what' I guess you didn't know it\, I'm a guitar player too\, and if you care to take a dare I make a bet with you. Now you play a real good guitar boy\, but give the devil his due\, I'll bet a guitar of gold against you soul 'cause i think i'm better then you.

COL title VAL Rose-Marie COL performer VAL Slim Whitman	COL video title VAL Average White Band ~ If I Ever Lose This Heaven "1975" Funk COL channel name VAL 2chann COL description VAL Their self-effacing name to the contrary\, Average White Band was anything but -- one of the few white groups to cross the color line and achieve success and credibility playing funk\, with their tight\, fiery sound also belying their Scottish heritage\, evoking American R&B hotbeds like Detroit\, Memphis\, and Philadelphia instead. Singer/bassist Alan Gorrie\, guitarists Hamish Stuart and Onnie McIntyre\, tenor saxophonist Malcolm Duncan\, keyboardist/saxophonist Roger Ball\, and drummer Robbie McIntosh comprised the original Average White Band lineup. Veterans of numerous Scottish soul and jazz groups\, they made their debut in 1973 as the opening act at Eric Clapton's Rainbow Theatre comeback gig\, soon issuing their debut LP\, Show Your Hand\, to little notice. After adopting the abbreviated moniker AWB\, a year later the band issued their self-titled sophomore effort\, topping the American pop charts with the Arif Mardin-produced instrumental "Pick Up the Pieces." The record's mammoth success was nevertheless tempered by the September 23\, 1974 death of McIntosh\, who died at a Hollywood party after overdosing on heroin.  Cut the Cake Ex-Bloodstone drummer Steve Ferrone replaced McIntosh for AWB's third album\, 1975's Cut the Cake\, which scored a Top Ten hit with its title track as well as two other chart entries\, "If I Ever Lose This Heaven" and "School Boy Crush." (Put It Where You Want It\, issued later that same year\, was simply a retitled and repackaged Show Your Hand.) With 1976's Soul Searching\, the group reclaimed the full Average White Band name\, scoring their final Top 40 hit with "Queen of My Soul." Following the live Person to Person\, they issued Benny & Us\, a collaboration with soul legend Ben E. King. However\, after subsequent outings\, including 1978's Warmer Communications\, 1979's Feel No Fret\, and 1980's Shine\, failed to recapture the energy of AWB's peak\, the group dissolved in 1982\, with Ferrone later joining Duran Duran and Stuart recording with Paul McCartney. Gorrie\, Ball\, and McIntyre reformed Average White Band in 1989\, tapping vocalist Alex Ligertwood for their comeback effort Aftershock. Oft-sampled by hip-hop producers throughout the 1990s\, the group continued touring prior to releasing Soul Tattoo in 1996. The live album\, Face to Face\, followed three years later.

I've only added the footage as a tribute for historical\, entertainment\, and creative purposes with no financial gain. Copyright infringement not intended.  The Four Tunes "I Sold My Heart To The Junkman" Jubilee 5174 A 1954  Here are The Four Tunes with their version of "I Sold My Heart To The Junkman." This is the 2nd pressing that was released in 1954 by Jubilee\, in the same year as the 1st pressing. A nice\, minty\, clean 78 for your enjoyment.  The 4 Tunes were probably the leading black Pop vocal group during the 1950s. Their origins can be traced back to a change of personnel in the Ink Spots. This requires a brief review of some events in the mid-40s. In June 1944\, during an engagement in Chicago\, Hoppy Jones became ill and the group had to finish a tour without him (Deek Watson filled in on the mandatory talking parts). This had unsuspected ramifications. Hoppy was the conciliatory father figure (nicknamed "the grand old man") of the Ink Spots. Now that he was missing\, infighting between Bill Kenny and Deek Watson\, which had formerly just smoldered\, now flared up unchecked. Deek had been the leader of the group until their 1939 smash of "If I Didn't Care." Since then\, Bill had firmly established himself in the forefront of the Ink Spots\, pushing Deek further and further into the background. Hoppy returned in August\, but by then\, the damage had been done.  When he announced (in the January 1945 settlement of the lawsuits) that he would form a new group based "on a completely new idea\," he simply changed their name to the "Brown Dots" (the name does sound somewhat familiar\, doesn't it?). As it turned out\, the "new idea" was to sound as much like the Ink Spots as possible. One real difference was that the Brown Dots relied more on harmony than the Ink Spots\, who were more individualists. (Since the Brown Dots were also managed by Moe Gale\, we know who the hands-down winner in this contest was.)  The polished style of the 4 Tunes was the product of their training\, experience\, dedication\, and discipline. Their songs were carefully selected and arranged. Their first arranger was pianist Ralph Herman\, who was the youngest member of Paul Whiteman's Orchestra. They also worked with Howard Biggs (whose most famous association was with the Ravens).  In mid-1953\, they once again changed labels (since they weren't making any royalties from RCA). This time they went to Jerry Blaine's Jubilee label\, where they achieved their greatest popularity. Their first Jubilee recording\, "Marie\," was released in September\, and reached #2 on the R&B charts (#13 Pop). This Irving Berlin tune had been a #1 smash for Tommy Dorsey (Jack Leonard on vocal) back in 1937. ("Marie" was such a big hit that the purely R&B Dominoes and Larks were pushed to sing in the same kind of Pop mold.) Their next Jubilee release\, "I Understand Just How You Feel" was an even bigger hit\, climbing to #6 on the Pop charts (#7 R&B).  1954 saw two releases on the Kay-Ron label. These were old Manor cuts (although different takes). Two of them were backups to Savannah Churchill ("Savannah Sings The Blues" and "I Want To Be Loved"). The other two were "Just In Case You Change Your Mind" (which was actually by the Brown Dots) and "I Understand" (which was presumably released to confuse record buyers into thinking it was the same song as the current "I Understand Just How You Feel").  On Jubilee\, the 4 Tunes were primarily a Pop group (although they did turn out something called "Rock N Roll Call"). Their output included "Don't Cry Darling\," "L'amour\, Toujours L'amour\," "I Sold My Heart To The Junkman\," "Time Out For Tears\," "You Are My Love\," "Far Away Places\," "Dancing With Tears In My Eyes\," "Sayonara\," and "A Little On The Lonely Side."  The 4 Tunes appeared for a week at the Apollo Theater (beginning April 2\, 1955)\, along with Red Prysock's Orchestra. They played both the black theater circuit and also many white clubs. When they were on a tour with Joni James\, she asked Jimmie Nabbie to write a song for her. The result\, "You Are My Love\," was her big hit of 1955 (which the 4 Tunes covered).  In 1955\, the 4 Tunes were booked into the Hacienda in Las Vegas on a handshake\, and stayed for eight years. Other members\, added at the time\, were Smiley Hightower (guitar and bassist) and Eddie Williams (bassist; formerly of Johnny Moore's Three Blazers). Also\, tenor Billy Wells (from Deek's second Brown Dots group) was hired so that each of the other members could go on vacation on a rotating basis.

COL title VAL Emotion COL performer VAL Shirley Bassey	COL video title VAL The Garden Of Eden By Frankie Vaughan COL channel name VAL texpaco COL description VAL Frankie Vaughan was an English singer of traditional pop music in the UK who released more than 80 recordings in his lifetime.  Born Frank Abelson\, the name 'Vaughan' came from a grandmother who used to call Frank "my number one grandson".  In his grandmothers Russian accent one sounded like Vaughan\, which he adopted as his stage name.  In 1955 he recorded what was to become his trademark song\, "Give Me The Moonlight\, Give Me The Girl".  He became known as "Mr. Moonlight" after this became his first big hit.  He recorded a large number of covers of US hit songs including "Kisses Sweeter than Wine" and "Come Softly to Me".  In early 1957 his cover of Jim Lowes "The Green Door" reached #1 on the UK Singles Chart.  In 1961 Vaughan hit #1 again in the UK with his cover of Gene McDaniels "Tower of Strength".  This selection was released in 1957\, spent four weeks at #1 in the UK and received heavy play on US jukeboxes.	0

COL title VAL You Can't Be True\, Dear COL performer VAL Ken Griffin at the Organ	COL video title VAL Kim Wilde - A Little Respect COL channel name VAL José Teixeira COL description VAL #kimwilde - A Little Respect  Song written and originally recorded by Erasure.  Erasure version The British synthpop duo Erasure released 'A Little Respect' in September 1988 as their tenth single. The single was taken from their album 'The Innocents'. The lyric is an empowering plea to a lover to show compassion and respect.  Kim Wilde version Kim Wilde performed this song live during her European tour in March/April 2009 and subsequent festival performances in the summer of 2009. She continued to perform the song in 2010 and during the 'Come Out and Play' tour in March 2011. In August 2011 the song was released as a studio recording on Kim's album Snapshots.  Kim about 'A little respect' 'A Little Respect' is a great song by Erasure\, Vince Clark and Andy Bell\, and I remember it came out in 1988 which was a really important year for me. I had 'Close' out which did really well\, and of course I was on tour with Michael Jackson\, so it all kindof kicked off that year. Every time I hear this song it just takes me back to that fantastic time in my career.  Andy Bell absolutely loved it and has told us so\, so that's one of the reasons why it's on [Pop Don't Stop\, the greatest hits compilation]. It was fully endorsed by him and he loves it\, so that means the world to us. Source: https://www.wilde-life.com/encyclopedia/a/a-little-respect  Lyrics: I try to discover A little something to make me sweeter Oh baby refrain from breaking my heart I'm so in love with you I'll be forever blue That you give me no reason Why you're making me work so hard  That you give me no That you give me no That you give me no That you give me no  Soul\, I hear you calling Oh baby please give a little respect to me  And if I should falter Would you open your arms out to me We can make love not war And live at peace in our hearts I'm so in love with you I'll be forever blue What religion or reason Could drive a man to forsake his lover  Don't you tell me no Don't you tell me no Don't you tell me no Don't you tell me no  Soul\, I hear you calling Oh baby please give a little respect to me  I'm so in love with you I'll be forever blue That you give me no reason You know you're making me work so hard  That you give me no That you give me no That you give me no That you give me no  Soul\, I hear you calling Oh baby please give a little respect to me Soul\, I hear you calling Oh baby please give a little respect to me	0

Written by Robby Krieger\, its riff was influenced by The Four Seasons' "C'mon Marianne." It is notable for its extensive usage of brass and string instruments (including a solo by featured saxophonist Curtis Amy) to accent Jim Morrison's vocals. It was one of The Doors' most popular singles.  It was released as a single in December 1968. The song reached #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #1 in the Cashbox Top 100 in early 1969 (the band's third American number-one single). The single also did well elsewhere\, peaking at #1 in the RPM Canadian Singles Chart and at #10 in the Kent Music Report in Australia. However\, despite the band's commercial success the previous year\, "Touch Me" did not chart in the UK Singles Chart.  Working titles  According to Bruce Botnick's liner notes the song was initially referred to by its various working titles; "I'm Gonna Love You\," from a line in the chorus\, or "Hit Me\," a reference to blackjack. The opening line was originally "C'mon\, hit me...I'm not afraid\," the line thus reflecting the first person vantage point of a blackjack player. Morrison reportedly changed the lyric out of concern that rowdy crowds at their live shows would mistakenly believe that "hit me" was a challenge to physically assault him.  One of the group's most famous television appearances is their performance of "Touch Me" on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour along with the single's B-side\, "Wild Child". The taping date was December 6\, 1968 with air date of December 15. During the performance\, Morrison missed his cue for the lines "C'mon\, c'mon" and Krieger could be seen with a black eye. Krieger stated in several interviews given after Morrison's death that Morrison had given him the black eye during a confrontation\, inadvertently referencing the song's original title. The group is backed by the Nelson Riddle Orchestra\, plus Curtis Amy duplicating the saxophone solo he also performed on the studio version.  Versions  The Guess Who covered the song.  Ian Astbury covered the song for the Doors tribute album\, Stoned Immaculate: The Music of the Doors.  In Oliver Stone's 1991 biopic The Doors\, Jim Morrison is portrayed as having modified the lyrics at a concert while drunk to make the song about oral sex.  The song was also featured in the 2003 film School of Rock when Jack Black's character teaches a child how to play the keyboard. It is included in the film's soundtrack.  Ajax Allusion  At the end of the song\, Morrison can be heard saying\, "Stronger than dirt\," which was the slogan of the Ajax household cleaning company\, because the last four notes of "Touch Me" were the same as those in an Ajax commercial and as a mocking criticism of Krieger\, John Densmore\, and Ray Manzarek wanting to accept an offer from Buick to use "Light My Fire" in a commercial. The deal was aborted when Morrison opposed it. This vocal was omitted on the single version which was a different mix.	0

After moving to Britain in 1965\, they had a number of top ten albums and singles there\, including the No. 1 chart hits "Make It Easy on Yourself" and "The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine (Anymore)\," both of which also made the US top 20.  Formed in 1964\, they adopted the 'Walker Brothers' name even though the members are all unrelated as a show business touch—"simply because we liked it." They provided a unique counterpoint to the British Invasion in that they were a group from the United States that achieved much more success in the United Kingdom than in their home country\, during the period when the popularity of British bands such as The Beatles dominated the US.	0

Era el verano claro está\, y yo empezaba a soñar con mi pasado. Ante un espejo le fingí que maquillaba mi nariz para mirarle. Cuando me vi tan cerca de él había dado no sé qué por conquistarle.  Me sonrió con intención y fue su edad la explicación de su victoria. No quiso hablarme del amor\, pues según él esa cuestión es otra historia. Me dijo tú me vas muy bien\, eres igual que la mujer de "El Graduado". Yo no pude resistir y entre sus brazos descubrí\, un sol dorado.  Dieciocho años nada más eso le hizo ser audaz mas que insolente. Cuando llegué a despertar\, solo sentí la soledad indiferente. Por un momento pretendí el retenerlo junto a mí\, pero no quise. Me dijo no has estado mal\, con un candor tan infernal\, antes de irse. Entonces tuve que fingir que maquillaba mi nariz\, para no verle y estuve a punto de olvidar que yo le doblaba la edad.	0

On the first tour we had such a great time\, that we wanted to do it all over again\, especially when we have such a great cause to promote such as the Salvation Army and Oasis Youth Support Network. We feel privileged to be able to help says Christine & Deni.    In a two hour show\, this sassy duo will perform their classic hits and favourite timeless songs along with some special duets\, including their own rendition of the Doobie Brothers hit TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS.   While promoting their 2008 tour\, Deni and Christine so happened to be performing one of their show duets TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS on the Today Show (Nine Network\, Australia). On the same show was a heartfelt segment about the plight of homelessness in Australia accompanied by Captain Paul Mould of the Salvation Armys Oasis Youth Support Network\, who take care and provide much needed services for the homeless and youth of Australia (who come from all walks of life.)  No less than 5 minutes after walking off set\, Christine and Deni turned to each other and said weve got to do something to help and the recording of TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS was set in motion.   Deni and Christine will release their version of TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS on 15 November 2008 (Nationwide) with fifty percent (50%) of profits going to the Salvation Armys Youth Homelessness Oasis Foundation and the Everyone Is Homeless Fund.  On Wednesday\, 17th December Christine and Deni will also stage a free Christmas concert version of their TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS show exclusively for the Salvation Armys Youth Homelessness Oasis Foundation and the homeless people of Sydney.   For further information on Salvation Armys Youth Homelessness Oasis Foundation and the Everyone Is Homeless Fund\, please refer to www.oasis.salvos.org.au  In the ABS Census 2001 (The 2006 Census data has not been finalized)\, there were 100\,000 homeless people (men\, women and children) across Australia\, one third (36\,173) are youth between 12-24 years of age.  Only 14.25% of homeless people were able to stay in services funded through SAAP (Supported Accommodation Assistance Program) jointly funded by both the Commonwealth and State Governments.  Christine and Deni would like to thank the following companies and people for donating their time and services free of charge of the purposes of this donation campaign drive -  301 Studios\, Sing Sing Studios\, David and Anthony @ DNA Songs\, Tony Espie\, David Walker at Stepford Audio\, John Adams\, Franco Raggatt\, Barbara Griffin\, Cameron Undy\, Michael Rohanek and Rob Thompson.	0

She speaks fluently Spanish\, English and Italian. Due to her great voice\, she has been compared to famous international singers\, to Whitney Houston above all. Session vocalist for various Dance productions in the 90's\, she's been performing a lot around the World and has taken part in many TV shows in Italy. She's also an author: she wrote for Mario Biondi on the albums 'Handful of soul' and 'I love you more'\, she co-wrote most of the songs on the Papik album 'Rhythm of life'\, together with her producer Nerio Poggi (aka Papik)\, including 'Staying for Good'\, the single from the album that's getting a great response worldwide. This is her first album under her own name and it's dedicated to remakes in a soul-jazz style of tunes from the 80's and 90's. Among the songs chosen: a bossa cover of 'Rhythm of the night' by Corona and an R&B version of 'Barbie Girl'. But the self-penned '1986' is the real gem on this album!

Growing up in an artistic\, politically engaged family in the Bronx\, he became an early rock 'n' roll convert after attending an Alan Freed rock 'n' roll revue that included performances by Chuck Berry\, Buddy Holly\, Jerry Lee Lewis\, Little Richard and Frankie Lymon.  His thirst for new and old sounds drove him to exploring blues\, soul\, country\, folk and jazz\, inspiring weekly visits to Harlem's Apollo Theatre and leading to acquaintances with many of the music's surviving originators.   Wolf's talent as a painter won him a grant to study at the Boston Museum School of Fine Arts.  While a student there\, he experienced a life-changing epiphany after jumping on stage to sing with a blues band at a loft party.  He soon talked himself into membership in that band\, The Hallucinations.   "I didn't join a band to meet girls\," Wolf recalls.  "I joined my first band to meet musicians.  Painting was a fascination for me\, but I was a music fanatic\, and sitting in with that band was a born-again type of experience for me.  I was transfixed\, and myself and some of the guys in the band would check out performances by the musicians we admired so much\, like Muddy Waters and John Lee Hooker and John Coltrane and Bill Monroe and the Stanley Brothers.  Those roots stayed with me."	0

COL title VAL Here Comes Summer COL performer VAL Cliff Richard and The Shadows	COL video title VAL Bert Kaempfert - The Way It Used To Be COL channel name VAL Socratess2007 COL description VAL Bert Kaempfert knew exactly which 'hitparade' songs could be 'transformed' into a "Kaempfert classic".  When Engelbert Humperdinck scored a major hit with "The Way it used to Be" in 1968\, Bert heard right away that this magnificent melody had all the elements it took for a 'new' Kaempfert track.  Bert obviously wrote a new orchestral arrangement\, where after a "new easy listening classic" was born :)  The album "Traces Of Love" - from which the track is taken - breathes quality from beginning to end.   Here we can listen to a Bert Kaempfert 'at his best' - bringing his tunes with an even larger orchestra and with audio technicians (eg Peter Klemt) behind the controls who make use of the newest recording technology available (at the time\, ie in 1969). If ever the term "heavenly music" could be used\, it sure is here.  Bert Kaempfert created music\, that\, without any doubt\, will please audiences for generations to come. From the 1969 album "Traces Of Love" here is "Mister Hitmaker" once again bringing you "The Way It Used To Be".  Enjoy.	0

COL title VAL You Showed Me COL performer VAL The Turtles	COL video title VAL Bob Luman - Early in The Morning (1958) COL channel name VAL AugieBurr COL description VAL Bob Luman on His 4th appearence on Town Hall Party at 1958.  ---ABOUT THE SONG--- "Early In The Morning" [US #24 - 1958] was a song written and recorded by Bobby Darin for Brunswick Records\, but as Darin was still under contract to Atlantic Records' subsidiary\, Atco\, the song was released by "The Ding Dongs". New York deejays liked the record and Atco soon discovered the deception. Brunswick was forced to turn over the masters to Atco which released the record under the name "The Rinky Dinks".  --- ABOUT THE ARTIST--- Bob Luman recieved his early musical influence in Nacogdoches\, Texas\, as his father was an amateur fiddle\, guitar and harmonica player.  In 1956\, he won a talent contest which earned him an appearance on the Louisiana Hayride. For the Hayride\, Luman formed a backup band called the Shadows. In 1957\, the band signed with Imperial Records\, where they recorded "All Night Long" and "Amarillo Blues".That same year\, the band appeared for the first time on the Town Hall Party in Los Angeles\, and appeared in the movie Carnival Rock. In 1958\, dropped by Imperial Records\, Luman signed with Capitol Records\, where he released "Try Me" and "I Know My Baby Cares." Capitol Records wanted Luman to change his name\, which he refused to do\, so he left the record label and signed with Warner Bros. Records\, recording "Class of '59" and "Loretta". In 1960\, Luman was drafted into the United States Army. It was while still in the Army that Warner Bros. Records released Luman's best-known crossover hit\, "Let's Think About Living\," a novelty song that hit #7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and #9 on the Billboard country music chart. After leaving the Army in 1962\, Luman moved to Nashville\, where he married. In 1965\, he joined the Grand Ole Opry. Luman toured frequently in the 60s and 70s\, and became popular in Las Vegas\, with an act which combined country and rockabilly. He signed with Epic Records in 1968\, and had several hits with them\, including "Still Loving You" and "Lonely Women Make Good Lovers" -his biggest country hit\, hitting #4 on the country chart. Luman's other country hits included "Ain't Got Time To Be Unhappy" (1968)\, "Ballad of Two Brothers" (with Autry Inman\, 1968)\, "When You Say Love" (1972)\, "Neither One Of Us (Wants To Be The First To Say Goodbye)" (1973)\, "Proud Of You Baby" (1975)\, and "The Pay Phone" (1977). Luman died in Nashville of pneumonia in 1978\, at the age of forty-one. After his death\, Bear Family Records released several compilations of his songs\, including More of the Rocker\, Still Rockin' and Carnival Rock. Luman is a member of both the Rockabilly Hall of Fame and the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame.  source: www.wikipedia.org	0

In retrospect\, it would have appeared that the Souls  may have been a decade ahead of time\, b'cos head today\, Live On sounds amazingly current with it's mix of roots\, funk\, soul\, jazz and pop \, and while it is true that it might be the least Jamaicans sounding of their albums\, with pedigree of crack island session players like Sly & Robbie\, Dwight Pinkney\, Sticky Thompson and Earl Lindo all over the tracks..."	0

COL title VAL She Cracked COL performer VAL The Modern Lovers	COL video title VAL 'Something in the Air' - new version by The Luck of Eden Hall (originally by Thunderclap Newman) COL channel name VAL FruitsdeMer2 COL description VAL 'Something In The Air' pretty much sums up UK pop psych in the sixties for me  - Speedy Kean wrote it\, Thunderclap Newman gave up his post round to play on it\, Pete Townsend produced it (and maybe played bass on it). Now The Luck of Eden Hall give it a Chicago psych rock feel and produce something pretty special along the way - nice one\, Curvey.  The Luck of Eden Hall will be familiar to followers of Fruits de Mer\, and 'Something' doesn't disappoint.   This is a 2 minute excerpt from a track on the new Fruits de Mer Records double album 'Keep Off The Grass' - on sale December 2011.   'Keep Off The Grass' is a limited-edition\, vinyl-only\, massive compilation of classic and obscure sixties tracks - from phased sunshine pop to dark fuzz\, and all things in between (and either side).  19 bands\, 19 tracks\, 85 minutes of music exclusive to this compilation.

"Ken" Griffin (December 28\, 1909 – March 11\, 1956) was an American organist. Griffin was born in Columbia\, Missouri. His biggest hit was "You Can't Be True\, Dear" (1948)\, which was first released as an instrumental\, and later that year re-released with a vocal by Jerry Wayne dubbed in. Both versions became popular\, selling over 3.5 million copies. He also starred in a 1954-55 syndicated television series\, 67 Melody Lane. He recorded on a variety of record labels including Columbia and Rondo. It was in the 1940s in Aurora\, Illinois that Griffin broke into the nightclub circuit\, playing at the Rivoli Cafe nightly. The sessions at the Rivoli cafe were broadcast on the radio station\, WMRO\, and the program became popular. Griffin died on March 11\, 1956 in Chicago\, Illinois at the age of 46\, of a heart attack and was buried at Lincoln Memorial Park in Aurora. Columbia had many hours of Griffin's unreleased recordings on tape\, and continued to release "new" recordings of Griffin's music for a number of years after his death.

Join our Youtube: https://goo.gl/8AOGaN Join our Facebook: http://goo.gl/5oL723 Chester Arthur Burnett (June 10\, 1910 -- January 10\, 1976)\, known as Howlin' Wolf\, was an influential American blues singer\, guitarist and harmonica player. He was born in West Point\, Mississippi in an area now known as White Station. With a booming voice and looming physical presence\, Burnett is commonly ranked among the leading performers in electric blues; musician and critic Cub Koda declared\, "no one could match Howlin' Wolf for the singular ability to rock the house down to the foundation while simultaneously scaring its patrons out of its wits." A number of songs written or popularized by Burnett—such as "Smokestack Lightnin'"\, "Back Door Man"\, "Killing Floor" and "Spoonful"—have become blues and blues rock standards.

It is London's trademark for the most advanced and flexible of all stereo recording techniques; it stands for motion and an uncanny sense of spatial realism unapproached by conventional disc standards; it is your assurance of unmatched quality control\, rigorously applied from studio to finished disc\, throughout every single step of the manufacturing process. Perhaps the most remarkable innovation of "phase 4" is the use of London's custom built 20 channel console mixer. This complex and forbidding-looking machine permits sounds from no less than twenty separate sources to be combined and blended in precise perspective. Each instrument can be pinpointed at exact locations from extreme left to extreme right along the horizontal plane\, or forward and back through an astonishingly large depth of field. This\, of course\, is only part of the "phase 4" story. The making of the master tape\, the cutting of the master lacquer disc\, production of the final copy for the consumer -all are done with custom equipment\, under the constant supervision of both engineers and musicians. The statement that the 500\,000th record produced is identical in sound performance with the very first copy pressed is no idle boast: it is part of the  unique and proud credo of "phase 4 stereo". »   Phase4Stereo :  Please use as a series only\, adding it together with the Decca or London Records labels. The mono parallel series and technique was Sound 4. Phase 4 Stereo was a series created in 1961\, supposedly for better sound\, by being recorded on a 10-channel\, and later 20-channel\, recording console. Approximately 200 LPs were released under this branch\, including popular music\, "gimmick" records engineered to make the sound travel from speaker to speaker\, records featuring percussion effects\, and historical sound-effect records. In 1964\, a light-classical Phase 4 Stereo Concert  Series was produced.	0

The collection features 11 new songs alongside a radically reworked rendition of the classic title song\, famously popularized by the one and only Pete Seeger nearly five decades ago\, but no less relevant today. The album represents an extraordinary snapshot of DiFranco's own life as well her sense of where the country stands at this particular moment in time.

COL title VAL Space Truckin' COL performer VAL Deep Purple	COL video title VAL Eiffel 65 - Blue (Da Ba Dee) COL channel name VAL malawolf85 COL description VAL Eiffel 65 is a three man (Gianfranco Randone\, Maurizio Lobina\, and Gabriele Ponte) Italian eurodance group. Best know for their international hit "Blue (Da Ba Dee)" Eiffel 65's debut album "Europop" sold over two million units in the US\, making them the best selling Italian eurodance group ever in the United States. The origin of the group's name is an interesting sequence of chance. The name "Eiffel" was chosen randomly by a computer program and the "65" was scribbled onto their name on a demo by mistake; it was actually part of a phone number. The group Eiffel 65 is also known for their many remixes of songs from other artists\, with over thirty of them to their name. In 2005 Gabriele Ponte left the group to focus on his solo career and in 2006 the reminding members left the Bliss Corporation to form their own duo called Bloom 06. The Bliss Corporation\, who owns the name Eiffel 65\, had announced a new line up for the group would be debuting in the summer of 2007 however the debut was postponed until further notice.	0

Purchase from the label: http://www.paradiseofbachelors.com/shop/pob-21 Purchase from Bandcamp: https://paradiseofbachelors.bandcamp.com/album/ambsace Other options: http://lnk.to/PoB21  The second album of astonishing duets by guitarists James Elkington (who has toured and/or recorded with Jeff Tweedy\, Richard Thompson\, and Steve Gunn\, among others) and Nathan Salsburg (an accomplished soloist deemed by NPR “one of those names we’ll all associate with American folk guitar”) is a sublime suite of nimble\, filigreed compositions by two singular stylists. Belying its title—“ambsace” is the lowest throw of dice; snake eyes—the record thrives on a gentle empathy and generosity of spirit\, sitting sneakily protean original compositions alongside gorgeous arrangements of songs by Duke Ellington and The Smiths at the same big hand-hewn table.

I've never found it on any CD\, and I doubt it will ever be reissued. This dub is from a mint promo copy.  Its a little too gummy to be called Power Pop\, but its a fun record. It almost beats the Rubinoos at their own game. It was only a mid-charting hit\, though I remember KLAW and KSWO in Lawton OK giving it a few spins back in the summer of 1977.   And I've never found another 45 by this group. Were they a studio group or a real band?

Join our Youtube: https://goo.gl/8AOGaN Join our Facebook: http://goo.gl/5oL723 Bob Dylan (/ˈdɪlən/; born Robert Allen Zimmerman\, May 24\, 1941) is an American singer-songwriter\, artist\, and writer. He has been an influential figure in popular music and culture for more than five decades. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s\, when he was both a chronicler and a reluctant figurehead of social unrest. A number of Dylan's early songs\, such as "Blowin' in the Wind" and "The Times They Are a-Changin'"\, became anthems for the American civil rights and anti-war movements. Leaving behind his initial base in the culture of the folk music revival\, Dylan's six-minute single "Like a Rolling Stone" radically altered the parameters of popular music in 1965. His mid-1960s recordings\, backed by rock musicians\, reached the top end of the United States music charts while also attracting denunciation and criticism from others in the folk movement.

Lyric: Today I burned your old love letters I burned them slowly one by one Before I'd light the flame I'd read them to try and find the wrongs I done  The first you wrote me was the sweetest the last one broke my heart in two And all alone I left you weeping for the ashes of your letters tied in blue  [ guitar ]   As I burned your old love letters I watched my dreams go up in smoke I lived again those precious mem'ries I heard each tender word you spoke  The first you wrote me was the sweetest the last one said that we were through Our love is there among the ambers in the ashes of your letters tied in blue	0

COL title VAL Poor Little Fool COL performer VAL The Fleetwoods	COL video title VAL Elly Lapp - Jonny wenn du Geburtstag hast.wmv COL channel name VAL schwarzantigone COL description VAL Elly Lapp Ganz nah  Genre: Deutsch-Pop\, Chanson\, Schlager   „Eine Stimme die unter die Haut geht.  Eindringlich\, lasziv\, ganz nah."   Elly Lapp liebt die Brückenschläge. Für sie sind UFA-Schlager und Popmusik keine  unarrangierbaren Gegensätze\, sondern interpretatorische Herausforderung. Dabei ist eine sehr moderne CD entstanden\,  die gleichzeitig sehr intensiv und sehr persönlich ist. Viel näher geht`s nicht.   Es waren große Songs -- es sind große Songs. Dazu leistet eine interessante Interpretin ihren Beitrag. Elly Lapp. Die studierte Schauspielerin und Sängerin tourt mit eigenen Programmen durch Deutschland -- und sie war die Stimme des Titelsongs der erfolgreichen ARD-Fernsehserie „Kir Royal".  „Der Wind hat mir ein Lied erzählt" - gleichzeitig erste Single - und „Ich steh` im Regen" sind Versuche einer ungewöhnlichen Verbindung von UFA - HIT und POPSOUND. Zarah Leander machte einst diese Songs zu Welterfolgen. Damals hatten die Autoren wohl nie eine Umsetzung mit rockigen Gitarren oder Saxophon im Auge. Hier geben die modernen Instrumente\, wie das gesamte Pop- Arrangement\, eine ganz neue Farbe -- voller Intensität.  Doch die CD von Elly Lapp zeigt die großen Filmhits nicht nur im Popgewand\, sondern auch sehr sparsam\, kunstvoll arrangiert\, als Chansons mit großer interpretatorischer Tiefe.  z.B." Wenn ich mir was wünschen dürfte" und - vor allem - „Der Nowack lässt mich nicht verkommen" -\, ein wahrer Kultsong\, 1959 geschrieben\, sofort auf Schallplatte aufgenommen\, kurzerhand von einem Münchner Gericht verboten und wieder eingestampft -- eine echte Rarität für jedes Rundfunk- und Privatarchiv!	0

COL title VAL Four O'Clock Blues COL performer VAL Johnny Dunn's Original Jazz Hounds	COL video title VAL FOUR UNTIL LATE (1937) by Robert Johnson COL channel name VAL wilson mcphert COL description VAL I first heard 'Four Until Late' sung by Eric Clapton on the Fresh Cream album. It was one of the first songs I learned on guitar\, and one I still like doing.  .   Robert Johnson\, of course\, was the author of the song (although clearly influenced by Blind Blake's 'Georgia Bound'- see my video). In 1937\, he travelled to Dallas\, Texas\, for his second and final recording session in a makeshift studio at the Brunswick Record Building\, 508 Park Avenue. He recorded this song on 19 June 1937.   It goes without saying that Johnson was one of the most influential blues singers in history. Wikipedia has a substantial profile on him.   There are only two photos of Johnson that I know of\, and I have used these and others to make a slideshow video.   Comments are welcome.	1

COL title VAL Some Broken Hearts Never Mend COL performer VAL Telly Savalas	COL video title VAL Eiffel 65 - Blue (Da Ba Dee) COL channel name VAL malawolf85 COL description VAL Eiffel 65 is a three man (Gianfranco Randone\, Maurizio Lobina\, and Gabriele Ponte) Italian eurodance group. Best know for their international hit "Blue (Da Ba Dee)" Eiffel 65's debut album "Europop" sold over two million units in the US\, making them the best selling Italian eurodance group ever in the United States. The origin of the group's name is an interesting sequence of chance. The name "Eiffel" was chosen randomly by a computer program and the "65" was scribbled onto their name on a demo by mistake; it was actually part of a phone number. The group Eiffel 65 is also known for their many remixes of songs from other artists\, with over thirty of them to their name. In 2005 Gabriele Ponte left the group to focus on his solo career and in 2006 the reminding members left the Bliss Corporation to form their own duo called Bloom 06. The Bliss Corporation\, who owns the name Eiffel 65\, had announced a new line up for the group would be debuting in the summer of 2007 however the debut was postponed until further notice.	0

COL title VAL Colonel Bogey Introducing Excerpts from River Kwai March COL performer VAL Geoff Love and His Orchestra	COL video title VAL Mitch Miller - The River Kwai March ~ Colonel Bogey March COL channel name VAL ubsswp COL description VAL RIP Mitch Miller! He died 99 years old!  Mitchell William Miller (July 4\, 1911 -- July 31\, 2010)was an American musician\, singer\, conductor\, record producer\, A&R man and record company executive. He was one of the most influential figures in American popular music during the 1950s and early 1960s.  In the early '50s Miller recorded with Columbia's house band as "Mitchell Miller and His Orchestra". He also recorded a string of successful albums and singles\, featuring a male chorale and his own distinctive arrangements\, under the name "Mitch Miller and the Gang" starting in 1950. The ensemble's hits included "Tzena\, Tzena\, Tzena"\, "The Yellow Rose of Texas"\, and the two marches from The Bridge on the River Kwai: "The River Kwai March and Colonel Bogey March".  The Bridge on the River Kwai is a British 1957 World War II film by David Lean; based on the novel The Bridge over the River Kwai by French writer Pierre Boulle. The film is a work of fiction but borrows the construction of the Burma Railway in 1942-43 for its historical setting. It stars Alec Guinness\, Sessue Hayakawa\, Jack Hawkins and William Holden.  In 1997\, this film was deemed "culturally\, historically\, or aesthetically significant" and selected for preservation in the United States Library of Congress National Film Registry.  Two prisoners of war are burying a corpse in the graveyard of a Japanese World War II prison camp in southern Burma. One\, American Navy Commander Shears (William Holden)\, routinely bribes guards to ensure he gets sick duty\, which allows him to avoid hard labour. A large contingent of British prisoners arrives\, marching in defiantly whistling the Colonel Bogey March under the leadership of Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness).  A memorable feature of the film is the tune that is whistled by the POWs—the "Colonel Bogey March"—when they enter the camp.The piece was originally written in 1914 by Kenneth Alford. It was accompanied by a counter-melody (known as "The River Kwai March") written by the film's composer\, Malcolm Arnold\, and played by the off-screen orchestra taking over from the whistlers. Mitch Miller had a hit with a recording of both marches.	1
COL title VAL Same Old Blues COL performer VAL Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown	COL video title VAL Dion DiMucci - Heart Of Saturday Night COL channel name VAL TopshelfTom COL description VAL What a killer track this is. Dion DiMucci covered this  Tom Waits classic on his 1978 comeback album Return Of The Wanderer (which is available on cd\, so go purchase it!!) and I was hooked immediately upon hearing this for the first time. This ranks among Dion's best stuff\, and everyone out there ought to dig this track! There are lots of versions of this song out there by many different artists\, but this is the best one I have heard of all of them. I will admit that for the sake of having a good sounding copy\, i swiped the audio off of the cd version so it is the album length rather than the single edit\, but i rarely do something like that for my videos. At least you know you'll be getting what you hear if you go out and buy this on cd! You can hear killer tunes like this one live every night on www.topshelfoldies.com!	0

The record was released in June 1979 on Optional Music with "The Man with the Dogs" as the b-side. The title track was re-recorded for the band's first album\, Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables (1980)\, and the version that appeared on this single\, as well as the single's b-side\, are available on the rarities album Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death (1987).  The lyrics were written by Jello Biafra and John Greenway\, and Biafra composed the music in one of his rare attempts at composing on bass.  This song was featured in the video game Tony Hawk's American Wasteland and as a downloadable song in the Rock Band series. It is also sampled in a song by the dance-punk/big beat trio The Prodigy\, "Dead Ken Beats". The song was also featured in the 2010 film The Social Network.  Meaning  The title is an allusion to the first (and no longer sung) stanza of the national anthem of Germany\, which begins with the words "Deutschland\, Deutschland über alles." (literally\, "Germany\, Germany above all.")  The song focuses on Jerry Brown\, the Governor of California 1975-1983 and 2011--present\, and is sung from his perspective. An imaginary Brown outlines a hippie-fascist vision for America\, in which his "suede denim secret police" kill un-cool people with "organic poison gas" chambers. Lines such as "Serpent's egg already hatched" (a reference to a line from William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar) comment on the corrosive nature of power. The line "now it is 1984" refers to the totalitarian regime of George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four\, describing a future (from 1979) where Jerry Brown has become President Brown presiding over secret police and gas chambers.  Cover versions  Blue Ribbon Glee Club regularly perform their version of the song.  The song was updated by The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy when they released a cover version in 1992 on the album Hypocrisy is the Greatest Legacy. They replaced references to Jerry Brown with references to Pete Wilson.  The song was also widely known in Poland (as "Kalifornia Ponad Wszystko") thanks to the cover by Polish rocker Kazik Staszewski with his band Kazik Na Żywo.  Hasidic New Wave perform a remake of the song on their 1999 album\, Kabalogy. In their version\, titled "Giuliani Über Alles"\, Jerry Brown is replaced by former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani.  The Delgados cover the song in their Peel Sessions CD set.  Six Feet Under do a cover the song on their Graveyard Classics album.  The black metal band Mayhem also covered the song.  Deceased covered the song on their punk covers album Rotten to the Core.  The hardcore band Ceremony has covered the song.  The Who Boys have done a mashup of "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" by Gil Scott-Heron called "Revolution Über Alles".  John Linnell and his band The Statesmen covered it live at least once during his "State Songs" tour\, choosing to perform it because it mentioned the state of California.  Dramarama has recorded a version\, updated in 2003 about California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger... "You will lift weights in school".  A 1986 live recording focused on Ronald Reagan on the album Mutiny On The Bay with live recordings from 1982 and 1986.  Jayne County covered the song with She Wolves about California's Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The green vinyl single was released under artist name Jayne County Meets The She Wolves by the German label Trash 2001.  Mexican death metal band Brujería covers Dead Kennedys with the song "California Uber Aztlan" in 2010.	0

Released in 1963\, it made the Top 10 on both the rhythm and blues and pop charts; the song was later covered by artists including Aretha Franklin\, James Taylor\, Carly Simon\, Dusty Springfield and Toby Keith. Other notable recordings were "Hurt by Love\," "Ask Me\," and "(1-2-3-4-5-6-7) Count the Days."   They were known for their exciting live performances\, of which a highlight was Inez's rendition of "I Stand Accused"\, which finished with a supposedly distraught Inez singing the last verse\, while being carried offstage by Charlie. They toured extensively in Europe and their music played a key role in the development of the Northern Soul movement.   Inez also had some success recording on her own\, beginning in 1969\, but her popularity faded in the 1970s. Charlie was already working as a record producer when they finally disbanded their act.   Inez Foxx was married to the American songwriter and producer Luther Dixon. Together they wrote\, and he produced\, The Platters' mid-1960s return to hit-making with the single "I Love You 1000 Times".[2] Luther Dixon produced Inez and Charlie's 1967 album Come By Here\, but the couple later divorced.[2]   Charlie Foxx died from leukemia in 1998\, at the age of 58.	0
COL title VAL Per un pugno di dollari COL performer VAL Tarahumara	COL video title VAL Dion DiMucci - Heart Of Saturday Night COL channel name VAL TopshelfTom COL description VAL What a killer track this is. Dion DiMucci covered this  Tom Waits classic on his 1978 comeback album Return Of The Wanderer (which is available on cd\, so go purchase it!!) and I was hooked immediately upon hearing this for the first time. This ranks among Dion's best stuff\, and everyone out there ought to dig this track! There are lots of versions of this song out there by many different artists\, but this is the best one I have heard of all of them. I will admit that for the sake of having a good sounding copy\, i swiped the audio off of the cd version so it is the album length rather than the single edit\, but i rarely do something like that for my videos. At least you know you'll be getting what you hear if you go out and buy this on cd! You can hear killer tunes like this one live every night on www.topshelfoldies.com!	0

This is our interpretation of XTCs atheistic song 'Dear God'\, an awesome some with a great message - 'religion is silly'. Ever since first hearing it we've been wanting to cover it and it seemed to be begging for the metal treatment!  Our version appears on our EP 'Watch It Burn' as part of the paid content. Both the free EP and the paid versions are available from our site: http://www.shiftband.net  When we play covers we like to put our own stamp on them and change things around a bit rather than just play a straight copy\, so hopefully we've captured the essence of the song and done it justice\, but keep that in mind when listening.	0

This ranks among Dion's best stuff\, and everyone out there ought to dig this track! There are lots of versions of this song out there by many different artists\, but this is the best one I have heard of all of them. I will admit that for the sake of having a good sounding copy\, i swiped the audio off of the cd version so it is the album length rather than the single edit\, but i rarely do something like that for my videos. At least you know you'll be getting what you hear if you go out and buy this on cd! You can hear killer tunes like this one live every night on www.topshelfoldies.com!	1

Her infectious spirit\, impeccable musicality\, and sheer joy in her faith are obvious in every recording and are a source of great inspiration.  http://www.rhiannongiddens.com/ http://www.twitter.com/rhiannongiddens http://www.instagram.com/rhiannongiddens http://www.facebook.com/RhiannonGiddensMusic	0

COL title VAL I'm Not Like Everybody Else COL performer VAL The Sacred Mushroom	COL video title VAL Jerry Lee Lewis - Let's Talk About Us COL channel name VAL Music Legends Book COL description VAL Jerry Lee Lewis (born September 29\, 1935) is an American singer-songwriter\, musician\, and pianist\, who is often known by his nickname of The Killer and is often viewed as "rock & roll's first great wild man." As an early pioneer of rock and roll music\, in 1956 Lewis made his first recordings at Sun Records in Memphis. "Crazy Arms" sold 300\,000 copies in the South\, but it was his 1957 hit "Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On" that shot Lewis to fame worldwide. Lewis followed this when he recorded songs such as "Great Balls of Fire"\, "Breathless" and "High School Confidential". However\, Lewis's rock and roll career faltered in the wake of his marriage to his 13-year-old cousin when he was 22. He had little success in the charts following the scandal and his popularity quickly faded. His live performance fees plummeted from $10\,000 per night to $250. In the meantime he was determined to gain back some of his popularity. During the early 1960s he didn't have much chart success with few exceptions such as "What'd I Say". His live performances at this time were increasingly wild and energetic. His album Live at the Star Club\, Hamburg from 1964 is often regarded by many music journalists and fans as one of the wildest and greatest rock and roll concert albums ever. After recording songs such as "I'm on Fire" for several years with little success\, in 1968 Lewis made a transition into country music and had hits with songs such as "Another Place\, Another Time". This reignited his career and throughout the late 1960s and 1970s he regularly topped the country-western charts. His No. 1 country hits included "To Make Love Sweeter For You"\, "There Must Be More to Love Than This"\, "Would You Take Another Chance on Me" and "Me and Bobby McGee"	0

COL title VAL Welcome to the Machine COL performer VAL Arjen Anthony Lucassen	COL video title VAL The Garden Of Eden By Frankie Vaughan COL channel name VAL texpaco COL description VAL Frankie Vaughan was an English singer of traditional pop music in the UK who released more than 80 recordings in his lifetime.  Born Frank Abelson\, the name 'Vaughan' came from a grandmother who used to call Frank "my number one grandson".  In his grandmothers Russian accent one sounded like Vaughan\, which he adopted as his stage name.  In 1955 he recorded what was to become his trademark song\, "Give Me The Moonlight\, Give Me The Girl".  He became known as "Mr. Moonlight" after this became his first big hit.  He recorded a large number of covers of US hit songs including "Kisses Sweeter than Wine" and "Come Softly to Me".  In early 1957 his cover of Jim Lowes "The Green Door" reached #1 on the UK Singles Chart.  In 1961 Vaughan hit #1 again in the UK with his cover of Gene McDaniels "Tower of Strength".  This selection was released in 1957\, spent four weeks at #1 in the UK and received heavy play on US jukeboxes.	0

The idea behind the #cryptcovers is to attempt to record a cover track\, chosen by the fans\, in just one day.

Released as a single in May 1970 (backed by the non-album track "Magic Mountain")\, it was War's first chart hit\, peaking at number three. It was also a top three hit in Canada and Australia. It charted #15 in Netherlands and #28 in Germany.  In 1996\, it was remixed by Junior Vasquez and released as a single again.  Lonnie Jordan said in an 2008 interview that Eric Burdon is the first Latin rapper in pop music.  In the introduction to the live version of the song on Greatest Hits Live\, Lonnie Jordan reveals that the inspiration for the song was a time when he spilled a glass of wine on a mixing board in the recording studio. Eric Burdon found the event funny\, so he and Jordan used it as the inspiration for the song.  Use in film  "Spill the Wine" was used in the popular motion pictures Boogie Nights\, Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo and Remember the Titans.  It was also sung during the The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air episode\, "That's No Lady\, That's My Cousin".  The song can also be heard in the Dexter episode "A Horse of a Different Color"\, while main characters Joey Quinn and Angel Batista are smoking a joint.  Cover versions  The song has been covered by: The Isley Brothers for their 1971 album Givin' It All Back\, as well as by The B-Side Players\, Juan Ma y su Sonido Costeño\, 2NU on their 1989 album Ponderous\, Lalo Schifrin\, Melvin Sparks\, Michael Hutchence\, The Dream Syndicate\, Lighter Shade of Brown\, Los Mocosos and Freaked Out Flower Children.

Inez sang lead vocal\, while Charlie sang back-up and played guitar.[1]   Their most successful record was with their novelty composition\, "Mockingbird". Released in 1963\, it made the Top 10 on both the rhythm and blues and pop charts; the song was later covered by artists including Aretha Franklin\, James Taylor\, Carly Simon\, Dusty Springfield and Toby Keith. Other notable recordings were "Hurt by Love\," "Ask Me\," and "(1-2-3-4-5-6-7) Count the Days."   They were known for their exciting live performances\, of which a highlight was Inez's rendition of "I Stand Accused"\, which finished with a supposedly distraught Inez singing the last verse\, while being carried offstage by Charlie. They toured extensively in Europe and their music played a key role in the development of the Northern Soul movement.   Inez also had some success recording on her own\, beginning in 1969\, but her popularity faded in the 1970s. Charlie was already working as a record producer when they finally disbanded their act.   Inez Foxx was married to the American songwriter and producer Luther Dixon. Together they wrote\, and he produced\, The Platters' mid-1960s return to hit-making with the single "I Love You 1000 Times".[2] Luther Dixon produced Inez and Charlie's 1967 album Come By Here\, but the couple later divorced.[2]   Charlie Foxx died from leukemia in 1998\, at the age of 58.	1

I've never found it on any CD\, and I doubt it will ever be reissued. This dub is from a mint promo copy.  Its a little too gummy to be called Power Pop\, but its a fun record. It almost beats the Rubinoos at their own game. It was only a mid-charting hit\, though I remember KLAW and KSWO in Lawton OK giving it a few spins back in the summer of 1977.   And I've never found another 45 by this group. Were they a studio group or a real band?   And if that Scott Shannon on the label is the DJ who now runs the "True Oldies" network and has programmed so many legendary Top 40-CHR radio stations in the past - thanks for a great record.. too bad it didnt do better!	0
COL title VAL Some Broken Hearts Never Mend COL performer VAL Don Williams	COL video title VAL Kim Wilde - A Little Respect COL channel name VAL José Teixeira COL description VAL #kimwilde - A Little Respect  Song written and originally recorded by Erasure.  Erasure version The British synthpop duo Erasure released 'A Little Respect' in September 1988 as their tenth single. The single was taken from their album 'The Innocents'. The lyric is an empowering plea to a lover to show compassion and respect.  Kim Wilde version Kim Wilde performed this song live during her European tour in March/April 2009 and subsequent festival performances in the summer of 2009. She continued to perform the song in 2010 and during the 'Come Out and Play' tour in March 2011. In August 2011 the song was released as a studio recording on Kim's album Snapshots.  Kim about 'A little respect' 'A Little Respect' is a great song by Erasure\, Vince Clark and Andy Bell\, and I remember it came out in 1988 which was a really important year for me. I had 'Close' out which did really well\, and of course I was on tour with Michael Jackson\, so it all kindof kicked off that year. Every time I hear this song it just takes me back to that fantastic time in my career.  Andy Bell absolutely loved it and has told us so\, so that's one of the reasons why it's on [Pop Don't Stop\, the greatest hits compilation]. It was fully endorsed by him and he loves it\, so that means the world to us. Source: https://www.wilde-life.com/encyclopedia/a/a-little-respect  Lyrics: I try to discover A little something to make me sweeter Oh baby refrain from breaking my heart I'm so in love with you I'll be forever blue That you give me no reason Why you're making me work so hard  That you give me no That you give me no That you give me no That you give me no  Soul\, I hear you calling Oh baby please give a little respect to me  And if I should falter Would you open your arms out to me We can make love not war And live at peace in our hearts I'm so in love with you I'll be forever blue What religion or reason Could drive a man to forsake his lover  Don't you tell me no Don't you tell me no Don't you tell me no Don't you tell me no  Soul\, I hear you calling Oh baby please give a little respect to me  I'm so in love with you I'll be forever blue That you give me no reason You know you're making me work so hard  That you give me no That you give me no That you give me no That you give me no  Soul\, I hear you calling Oh baby please give a little respect to me Soul\, I hear you calling Oh baby please give a little respect to me	0

COL title VAL Bimbo COL performer VAL Jim & Joe	COL video title VAL Ruby Wright - Bimbo COL channel name VAL AFantasticVoyage COL description VAL VARIOUS: THEN 1954  1954 -- now\, that's what we call an exceptional year! Perhaps best remembered in Britain for the end of rationing after 14 years\, 1954 also saw the marriage of Marilyn Monroe to Joe Di Maggio\, the first royal tour of Australia\, the breaking of the four-minute mile by runner Roger Bannister\, and the first World Cup to be televised.  Much memorable music was also made that year\, and you can hear many of the most popular hits from back then right now on THEN 1954\, continuing the new series from Fantastic Voyage\, the label that brings you the highly popular British Hit Parade compilations. Unlike that series\, which provides two multi-disc sets per year intended for the serious chart completists out there\, the THEN series has the more casual music buyer in mind.  Although THEN 1953 includes many UK and US chart-toppers\, the series is not constrained by chart position or label in its aim of presenting the most memorable sounds of each year. Successive volumes of THEN will follow over the coming months. Each one is compiled and annotated by eminent chartwatcher Dave McAleer\, the former chief consultant and contributor to the now defunct Guinness Book Of British Hit Singles\, who is currently devising pop quiz books for the Official Charts Company and assisting with the Virgin Book Of British Hit Albums.  Dave's sleeve notes spend as much time recalling the news events of the year as they do exploring the musical highlights. If you are looking to build up a library of the most enduring British hits from each year\, THEN is the series for you. If you are looking for a souvenir of a particular year -- to remember a birth\, a first kiss\, or a wedding -- THEN will provide the soundtrack to those memories.	1

COL title VAL Words of Love COL performer VAL Jessica Lee Mayfield	COL video title VAL NASHVILLE WEST (ft. Clarence White) - "Mental Revenge" - 1967 COL channel name VAL BobSeger1981 COL description VAL Nashville West included: Clarence White (Byrds)\, Gene Parsons\, Gib Guibeau and Wayne Moore. This is from the 1967\, self-titled\, album.  There are a few records that can be considered birthplaces of what has become known as "country-rock." Two Gene Clark albums\, Echoes and Fantastic Expedition\, come to mind\, as well as the Byrds' Sweetheart of the Rodeo and the International Submarine Band's debut. Add to that list -- and put it high up there -- Nashville West\, a self-titled debut by a group that consisted of Gib Guilbeau\, Wayne Moss\, and two future Byrds\, Gene Parsons and the great Clarence White\, and it's White's awesome guitar work that puts this album in a legendary context. Aside from the revolutionary playing by White\, the group has a forceful yet laid-back groove that\, if you like it on the first cut\, "Nashville West\," will have you digging the whole record. Parsons' drumming has a slightly soulful edge\, which predates the Flying Burrito Brothers' experiments by several years. One of the best cuts on the album is a cover of "Ode to Billy Joe\," which has White and Parsons laying into a groove that is indescribably delicious. Ignoring the historical value of this CD\, the whole record is a hell of a lot of fun.  Vocally\, not really what you'd call a masterpiece\, but it doesn't matter -- Nashville West is a record that should be owned by any fan of the Byrds\, the Flying Burrito Brothers\, Dillard & Clark\, and country music as a genre. Brilliant. ~ Matthew Greenwald	0

King & Bobby Bland	COL video title VAL Clarence White - Arkansas Traveller (recorded 1962) COL channel name VAL MyMoppet52 COL description VAL "Arkansas Traveller" from "33 Acoustic Guitar Instrumentals" made in 1962 & released in 2001. I love the music of Clarence White & decided it was time to put some out. It's a great listen & was made as learning tapes to be given as gifts to his friends. It was found after his sudden death at age 29\, killed by a drunk driver. This was a tape\, recorded by Ry Cooder in White's home in early tape days. He was with The Byrds\, The New KY Colonels\, backed Emmylou & Gram\, Jackson Browne\, The Everly Bros\,the supergroup Muleskinner (look up the members)\, Gene Watston\,Arlo Guthrie...almost anyone who was playing good music at the time. Many believe he would have been the crossover giant in music if not for his untimely death. He steered clear of drugs & booze. Tony Rice & Marty Stuart bought 2 of his guitars due to their respect for him. Enjoy!	0

COL title VAL Cruel to Be Kind COL performer VAL Nick Lowe	COL video title VAL Bert Kaempfert - The Way It Used To Be COL channel name VAL Socratess2007 COL description VAL Bert Kaempfert knew exactly which 'hitparade' songs could be 'transformed' into a "Kaempfert classic".  When Engelbert Humperdinck scored a major hit with "The Way it used to Be" in 1968\, Bert heard right away that this magnificent melody had all the elements it took for a 'new' Kaempfert track.  Bert obviously wrote a new orchestral arrangement\, where after a "new easy listening classic" was born :)  The album "Traces Of Love" - from which the track is taken - breathes quality from beginning to end.   Here we can listen to a Bert Kaempfert 'at his best' - bringing his tunes with an even larger orchestra and with audio technicians (eg Peter Klemt) behind the controls who make use of the newest recording technology available (at the time\, ie in 1969). If ever the term "heavenly music" could be used\, it sure is here.  Bert Kaempfert created music\, that\, without any doubt\, will please audiences for generations to come. From the 1969 album "Traces Of Love" here is "Mister Hitmaker" once again bringing you "The Way It Used To Be".  Enjoy.	0

COL title VAL Et voi ymmärtää COL performer VAL Pate Mustajärvi	COL video title VAL Mitch Miller - The River Kwai March ~ Colonel Bogey March COL channel name VAL ubsswp COL description VAL RIP Mitch Miller! He died 99 years old!  Mitchell William Miller (July 4\, 1911 -- July 31\, 2010)was an American musician\, singer\, conductor\, record producer\, A&R man and record company executive. He was one of the most influential figures in American popular music during the 1950s and early 1960s.  In the early '50s Miller recorded with Columbia's house band as "Mitchell Miller and His Orchestra". He also recorded a string of successful albums and singles\, featuring a male chorale and his own distinctive arrangements\, under the name "Mitch Miller and the Gang" starting in 1950. The ensemble's hits included "Tzena\, Tzena\, Tzena"\, "The Yellow Rose of Texas"\, and the two marches from The Bridge on the River Kwai: "The River Kwai March and Colonel Bogey March".  The Bridge on the River Kwai is a British 1957 World War II film by David Lean; based on the novel The Bridge over the River Kwai by French writer Pierre Boulle. The film is a work of fiction but borrows the construction of the Burma Railway in 1942-43 for its historical setting. It stars Alec Guinness\, Sessue Hayakawa\, Jack Hawkins and William Holden.  In 1997\, this film was deemed "culturally\, historically\, or aesthetically significant" and selected for preservation in the United States Library of Congress National Film Registry.  Two prisoners of war are burying a corpse in the graveyard of a Japanese World War II prison camp in southern Burma. One\, American Navy Commander Shears (William Holden)\, routinely bribes guards to ensure he gets sick duty\, which allows him to avoid hard labour. A large contingent of British prisoners arrives\, marching in defiantly whistling the Colonel Bogey March under the leadership of Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness).  A memorable feature of the film is the tune that is whistled by the POWs—the "Colonel Bogey March"—when they enter the camp.The piece was originally written in 1914 by Kenneth Alford. It was accompanied by a counter-melody (known as "The River Kwai March") written by the film's composer\, Malcolm Arnold\, and played by the off-screen orchestra taking over from the whistlers. Mitch Miller had a hit with a recording of both marches.	0

COL title VAL I'm on the Outside Looking In / It's Gonna Take a Miracle COL performer VAL Cooper & Ross	COL video title VAL Laura Nyro - It's gonna take a miracle 1971 COL channel name VAL Mr.Lotsopa COL description VAL Laura Nyro (October 18\, 1947 -- April 8\, 1997) was an American composer\, lyricist\, singer\, and pianist. Her style was a hybrid of Brill Building-style New York pop\, jazz\, gospel\, rhythm and blues\, show tunes\, rock and soul.  She was best known\, and enjoyed her greatest commercial success\, as a composer and lyricist rather than as a performer. Between 1968 and 1970 a number of other singers had significant hits with her songs: The 5th Dimension with "Blowing Away"\, "Wedding Bell Blues"\, "Stoned Soul Picnic"\, "Sweet Blindness"\, "Save The Country" and "Black Patch"; Blood\, Sweat & Tears and Peter\, Paul & Mary with "And When I Die"; Three Dog Night with "Eli's Coming"; and Barbra Streisand with "Stoney End"\, "Time and Love"\, and "Hands off the Man (Flim Flam Man)". Nyro's best-selling single was her recording of Carole King and Gerry Goffin's "Up on the Roof."   Lyrics:  Loving you so I was too blind to see you letting me go But now that you've set me free It's gonna take a miracle Yes\, it's gonna take a miracle To make me love someone new Cause I'm crazy for you  Oh oh\, didn't you know It wouldn't be so easy lettin' you go I could have told you that it's gonna take a miracle  oh-uh Yes\, it's gonna take a miracle To make me love someone new Cause I'm crazy for you  Oh\, tho' I know I can't forget? about you or come so? will show you how much You're turning me around\, destroying me I'll never be the same anymore  You must realize You took your love and left me Quite by surprise You can be sure that now it's gonna take a miracle Yes\, it's gonna take a miracle To make me love someone new Cause I'm crazy for you	1

Growing up in an artistic\, politically engaged family in the Bronx\, he became an early rock 'n' roll convert after attending an Alan Freed rock 'n' roll revue that included performances by Chuck Berry\, Buddy Holly\, Jerry Lee Lewis\, Little Richard and Frankie Lymon.  His thirst for new and old sounds drove him to exploring blues\, soul\, country\, folk and jazz\, inspiring weekly visits to Harlem's Apollo Theatre and leading to acquaintances with many of the music's surviving originators.   Wolf's talent as a painter won him a grant to study at the Boston Museum School of Fine Arts.  While a student there\, he experienced a life-changing epiphany after jumping on stage to sing with a blues band at a loft party.  He soon talked himself into membership in that band\, The Hallucinations.   "I didn't join a band to meet girls\," Wolf recalls.  "I joined my first band to meet musicians.  Painting was a fascination for me\, but I was a music fanatic\, and sitting in with that band was a born-again type of experience for me.  I was transfixed\, and myself and some of the guys in the band would check out performances by the musicians we admired so much\, like Muddy Waters and John Lee Hooker and John Coltrane and Bill Monroe and the Stanley Brothers.  Those roots stayed with me."	0

COL title VAL It's My Own Fault COL performer VAL Robben Ford	COL video title VAL NASHVILLE WEST (ft. Clarence White) - "Mental Revenge" - 1967 COL channel name VAL BobSeger1981 COL description VAL Nashville West included: Clarence White (Byrds)\, Gene Parsons\, Gib Guibeau and Wayne Moore. This is from the 1967\, self-titled\, album.  There are a few records that can be considered birthplaces of what has become known as "country-rock." Two Gene Clark albums\, Echoes and Fantastic Expedition\, come to mind\, as well as the Byrds' Sweetheart of the Rodeo and the International Submarine Band's debut. Add to that list -- and put it high up there -- Nashville West\, a self-titled debut by a group that consisted of Gib Guilbeau\, Wayne Moss\, and two future Byrds\, Gene Parsons and the great Clarence White\, and it's White's awesome guitar work that puts this album in a legendary context. Aside from the revolutionary playing by White\, the group has a forceful yet laid-back groove that\, if you like it on the first cut\, "Nashville West\," will have you digging the whole record. Parsons' drumming has a slightly soulful edge\, which predates the Flying Burrito Brothers' experiments by several years. One of the best cuts on the album is a cover of "Ode to Billy Joe\," which has White and Parsons laying into a groove that is indescribably delicious. Ignoring the historical value of this CD\, the whole record is a hell of a lot of fun.  Vocally\, not really what you'd call a masterpiece\, but it doesn't matter -- Nashville West is a record that should be owned by any fan of the Byrds\, the Flying Burrito Brothers\, Dillard & Clark\, and country music as a genre. Brilliant. ~ Matthew Greenwald	0

COL title VAL Love Don't Live Here Anymore COL performer VAL Joe Cocker	COL video title VAL Little Birdie - Vernon Dalhart COL channel name VAL althazarr's good time oldies COL description VAL Recorded on September 19\, 1925 under the pseudonym of Al Craver. Dalhart was born in Jefferson\, Texas. He took his stage name from two towns\, Vernon and Dalhart in Texas\, between which he punched cattle in the 1890s. Dalhart's father\, Robert Marion Slaughter was killed by his brother-in-law\, Bob Castleberry\, when Vernon was age 10. When Vernon was 12 or 13\, the family moved from Jefferson to Dallas\, Texas. Vernon\, who already could play the jaw harp and harmonica\, received vocal training at the Dallas Conservatory of Music. He married Sadie Lee Moore-Livingston in 1901 and had two children\, a son and a daughter. Around 1910 the family moved to New York City. He found employment in a piano warehouse and took occasional singing jobs. One of his first roles was in Giacomo Puccini's opera Girl of the Golden West; following this he played the part of Ralph Rackstraw in a production of HMS Pinafore. He also played the part of Lieutenant Pinkerton in Madame Butterfly.  He saw an advertisement in the local newspaper for singers and applied\, and was auditioned by Thomas Alva Edison; he would thereafter make numerous records for Edison Records. From 1916 until 1923\, using numerous pseudonyms\, he made over 400 recordings of light classical music and early dance band vocals for various record labels. He was already an established singer when he made his first country music recordings which cemented his place in music history. Dalhart's 1924 recording of "The Wreck of the Old 97"—a classic American railroad ballad about the September 27\, 1903 derailment of Southern Railway Fast Mail train No. 97 near Danville\, Virginia—for the Victor Talking Machine Company\, became a runaway hit\, alerting the national record companies to the existence of a sizable market for country-style vocals. It became the first Southern song to become a national success. The double-sided single eventually sold more than seven million copies\, a colossal number for a mid-1920s recording. It was the best-selling single to its time\, and was the biggest-selling non-holiday record in the first 70 years of recorded music. Research by Billboard statistician Joel Whitburn determined "The Prisoner's Song" to have been a No. 1 hit for 12 weeks in 1925-26. In 1998\, "The Prisoner's Song" was honored with a Grammy Hall of Fame Award and the Recording Industry Association of America named it one of the Songs of the Century. It was the desire of the Victor Talking Machine Company to duplicate the sales success of 'Wreck/Prisoner' that led them to contract with Ralph S. Peer to go to the southern mountains in the Summer of 1927 to facilitate 'The Bristol Sessions'\, arguably the single-most important recording event in the history of country music\, where Jimmie Rodgers and the original Carter Family were first discovered\, and after which\, Peer's royalty model would become the standard of the entire recorded music industry. He recorded under a host of pseudonyms given to him by recording managers. On Grey Gull Records he often used the pseudonym Vel Veteran\, which was however also used by other singers\, including Arthur Fields (Fields also used the pseudonym "Mr. X"). It is thought that Dalhart had the most recordings of any person in history. To some\, Dalhart's Southern accent seemed artificial. In a 1918 interview Dalhart said\, "When you are born and brought up in the South your only trouble is to talk any other way...the sure 'nough Southerner talks almost like a Negro\, even when he's white. I've broken myself of the habit\, more or less\, in ordinary conversation\, but it still comes pretty easy." While some country music purists always viewed Dalhart with some suspicion because of his light opera background and a vocal style that was closer to pop than country\, he was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970\, into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1981 and into the Gennett Records Walk of Fame in 2007. Dalhart died in Bridgeport\, Connecticut in 1948 and is interred there in the Mountain Grove Cemetery.	0

Tudo dará certo sha na na na na na.... Sha na na na na na na na... Agora simplesmente me abrace forte  Cante para mim mamãe (mama mama ma) Cante isso doce e claro\, oh!

Join our Youtube: https://goo.gl/8AOGaN Join our Facebook: http://goo.gl/5oL723 Chester Arthur Burnett (June 10\, 1910 -- January 10\, 1976)\, known as Howlin' Wolf\, was an influential American blues singer\, guitarist and harmonica player. He was born in West Point\, Mississippi in an area now known as White Station. With a booming voice and looming physical presence\, Burnett is commonly ranked among the leading performers in electric blues; musician and critic Cub Koda declared\, "no one could match Howlin' Wolf for the singular ability to rock the house down to the foundation while simultaneously scaring its patrons out of its wits." A number of songs written or popularized by Burnett—such as "Smokestack Lightnin'"\, "Back Door Man"\, "Killing Floor" and "Spoonful"—have become blues and blues rock standards.

Hear the pipes are calling\, Loudly and proudly calling\, Down thro' the glen. There where the hills are sleeping\, Now feel the blood a-leaping\, High as the spirits of the old Highland men.  Towering in gallant fame\, Scotland my mountain hame\, High may your proud standards gloriously wave\, Land of my high endeavour\, Land of the shining river\, Land of my heart for ever\, Scotland the brave.  High in the misty Highlands\, Out by the purple islands\, Brave are the hearts that beat Beneath Scottish skies. Wild are the winds to meet you\, Staunch are the friends that greet you\, Kind as the love that shines from fair maiden's eyes.  Towering in gallant fame\, Scotland my mountain hame\, High may your proud standards gloriously wave\, Land of my high endeavour\, Land of the shining river\, Land of my heart for ever\, Scotland the brave.  Far off in sunlit places\, Sad are the Scottish faces\, Yearning to feel the kiss Of sweet Scottish rain. Where tropic skies are beaming\, Love sets the heart a-dreaming\, Longing and dreaming for the homeland again.  Towering in gallant fame\, Scotland my mountain hame\, High may your proud standards gloriously wave\, Land of my high endeavour\, Land of the shining river\, Land of my heart for ever\, Scotland the brave. Land of my heart for ever\, Scotland the brave.	1

When questioned who had sent for him\,  He answered with his thumb\,  For his tongue it could not speak\, but only flatter.   He stayed behind the assembly hall\,  It was there he made his bed\,  Oftentimes he could be seen returning.  Until one day he just appeared  With a note in his hand which read\,  "The soles of my feet\, I swear they're burning."   Oh\, the leaves began to fallin'  And the seas began to part\,  And the people that confronted him were many.  And he was told but these few words\,  Which opened up his heart\,  "If ye cannot bring good news\, then don't bring any."   I do not own this. All rights belong to the respective owners.	0

Fools Fall In Love  ------------------------  "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" is a song by American punk rock band Green Day. It was released as the second single from their seventh album\, American Idiot. The song was written by Green Day\, with lyrics by lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong. The single peaked at number two in the United States\, making it Green Day's most successful song.  Influences and covers  Noel Gallagher of Oasis criticized Green Day in late 2006\, saying\, "They should have the decency to wait until I am dead [before stealing my songs]. I\, at least\, pay the people I steal from that courtesy"\, referencing the fact that "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" uses the same chord progression as Oasis's hit single "Wonderwall". Gallagher's reaction may have partly been due to the emergence of "Boulevard of Broken Songs"\, a popular mash-up mixed by San Francisco DJ and producer Party Ben in late 2004. The mix consisted of elements from "Boulevard of Broken Dreams"\, "Wonderwall"\, Travis' "Writing to Reach You" and Eminem's "Sing for the Moment"\, which itself has samples from Aerosmith's "Dream On" (another remix by Party Ben featured this\, "Wonderwall" and Kanye West's "Flashing Lights"). This song was covered by Japanese-American singer Hikaru Utada acoustically with a guitar during an internet broadcast in December 2005; a video of it can be found. "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" is sung first and then fades into "Passion" (After the Battle version) from the Kingdom Hearts II original soundtrack. "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" is also featured in the movie trailer of Lords of Dogtown (2005)\, starring Heath Ledger\, Emile Hirsch and John Robinson. Billie Joe Armstrong wrote the song while he was in his son Joey's bedroom.[citation needed] In the 2005 VH1 Storytellers program featuring Green Day\, Billie Joe Armstrong stated that the title of the song was "nicked" from the famous Gottfried Helnwein painting of the same title\, which features James Dean. Four earlier songs also have the same title: an old Harry Warren song\, a Hanoi Rocks song\, a Marianne Faithfull song\, and song by Brian Setzer from his 1986 album The Knife Feels Like Justice Lyrics from the song bear some resemblance to the Pinhead Gunpowder song "I Walk Alone"\, a band in which Billie Joe Armstrong also sings. It appeared on their 1997 album\, Goodbye Ellston Avenue. The song also shares some lyrics with the Whitesnake song "Here I Go Again"\, the words "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" can be found in the lyrics of the Elvis Costello song "Brilliant Mistake"\, the Allman Brothers Band song "End of the Line"\, the Deadsy song "The Key to Gramercy Park"\, and The Ataris song "Road Signs and Rock Songs". The phrase "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" also appears in punk/new wave band Blondie's 1982 minor UK-hit single Island of Lost Souls. A live version of the song can be found on Bullet in a Bible\, a live album of Green Day performing at the Milton Keynes National Bowl. Bluegrass band Cornbread Red did a cover of the song on a tribute album to Green Day Pickin' on Green Day\, while the German choir Gregorian did a cover\, on their Masters of Chant Chapter V album\, in the style of a Gregorian Chant. Mark Mallman covered this song on his MP3-only compilation release Outtakes Vol 1. The song is also featured in Green Day's musical American Idiot\, sung on the cast recording by John Gallagher Jr.\, Rebecca Naomi Jones\, and the rest of the company.	0

COL title VAL Baby COL performer VAL Secret 7 Line	COL video title VAL Walker Brothers :::: Pretty Girls Everywhere. COL channel name VAL SixtiesOnly COL description VAL The Walker Brothers were an American pop group of the 1960s and 1970s\, comprising Scott Engel (eventually known professionally as Scott Walker)\, John Walker (born John Maus\, but using the name Walker since his teens)\, and Gary Leeds (eventually known as Gary Walker). After moving to Britain in 1965\, they had a number of top ten albums and singles there\, including the No. 1 chart hits "Make It Easy on Yourself" and "The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine (Anymore)\," both of which also made the US top 20.  Formed in 1964\, they adopted the 'Walker Brothers' name even though the members are all unrelated as a show business touch—"simply because we liked it." They provided a unique counterpoint to the British Invasion in that they were a group from the United States that achieved much more success in the United Kingdom than in their home country\, during the period when the popularity of British bands such as The Beatles dominated the US.	0

"Ken" Griffin (December 28\, 1909 – March 11\, 1956) was an American organist. Griffin was born in Columbia\, Missouri. His biggest hit was "You Can't Be True\, Dear" (1948)\, which was first released as an instrumental\, and later that year re-released with a vocal by Jerry Wayne dubbed in. Both versions became popular\, selling over 3.5 million copies. He also starred in a 1954-55 syndicated television series\, 67 Melody Lane. He recorded on a variety of record labels including Columbia and Rondo. It was in the 1940s in Aurora\, Illinois that Griffin broke into the nightclub circuit\, playing at the Rivoli Cafe nightly. The sessions at the Rivoli cafe were broadcast on the radio station\, WMRO\, and the program became popular. Griffin died on March 11\, 1956 in Chicago\, Illinois at the age of 46\, of a heart attack and was buried at Lincoln Memorial Park in Aurora. Columbia had many hours of Griffin's unreleased recordings on tape\, and continued to release "new" recordings of Griffin's music for a number of years after his death.

She speaks fluently Spanish\, English and Italian. Due to her great voice\, she has been compared to famous international singers\, to Whitney Houston above all. Session vocalist for various Dance productions in the 90's\, she's been performing a lot around the World and has taken part in many TV shows in Italy. She's also an author: she wrote for Mario Biondi on the albums 'Handful of soul' and 'I love you more'\, she co-wrote most of the songs on the Papik album 'Rhythm of life'\, together with her producer Nerio Poggi (aka Papik)\, including 'Staying for Good'\, the single from the album that's getting a great response worldwide. This is her first album under her own name and it's dedicated to remakes in a soul-jazz style of tunes from the 80's and 90's. Among the songs chosen: a bossa cover of 'Rhythm of the night' by Corona and an R&B version of 'Barbie Girl'. But the self-penned '1986' is the real gem on this album!

COL title VAL Adventures in Paradise COL performer VAL The Islanders	COL video title VAL Squid Jigging Ground COL channel name VAL Standard Ranch Stash COL description VAL I’ve always loved this track\, taken from George Hamilton IV’s Down East Country album. It’s history\, below\, is new to me but I’ve always wondered about squid jigging!  (From: http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca)  This account of high jinks on the squid-fishing grounds is one of Newfoundland's best-known songs. Its words were written by the 15-year-old Arthur Scammell in 1928 as a high-school project.  This account of high jinks on the squid-fishing grounds is one of Newfoundland's best-known songs. Its words were written by the 15-year-old Arthur Scammell in 1928 as a high-school project. Squid jigging\, in which a jigger\, an un-baited\, lined hook\, is submerged in water and jerked upwards to grasp the arms of squid and flip them into boats\, was a common practice in Scammell's hometown of Change Islands. Published in Gerald Doyle's Old-Time Songs and Poetry of Newfoundland (second edition\, 1940)\, the song was copyrighted by Scammell in 1944\, was issued as sheet music by BMI Canada\, and appeared later in other folksong collections. Scammell's widely successful 1943 recording of "Squid Jiggin' Ground" is regarded as the first commercial recording of a Newfoundland folk song. The song has been subsequently recorded by Omar Blondahl\, George Hamilton IV\, Harry Hibbs\, Ed McCurdy\, Alan Mills\, Dick Nolan\, Hank Snow\, the Travellers\, the Irish Rovers\, and others. The tune was played on the Peace Tower carillon in Ottawa to mark the entry of Newfoundland into the confederation of Canada in 1949. In 2011 the song was inducted into the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame. Its lyrics\, which were adapted to an Irish fiddle tune\, "Larry O'Gaff\," depict the squid-jigging activities of local fisherman:  . A. R. Scammell\, Squid Jiggin' Ground Copyright 1944  Oh... this is the place where the fishermen gather With oil-skins and boots and Cape Anns battened down All sizes of figures with squid lines and jiggers They congregate here on the squid-jiggin' ground.  Some are workin' their jiggers while others are yarnin' There's some standin' up and there's more lyin' down While all kinds of fun\, jokes and tricks are begun As they wait for the squid on the squid-jiggin' ground.  There's men of all ages and boys in the bargain There's old Billy Cave and there's young Raymond Brown There's a red rantin' Tory out here in the dory A-runnin' down Squires on the squid-jiggin' ground.  There's men from the Harbour and men from the Tickle In all kinds of motorboats... green\, grey and brown Right yonder is Bobby and with him is Nobby He's chewin' hard tack on the squid-jiggin' ground.   The man with the whiskers is old Jacob Steele He's gettin' well up but he's still pretty sound While Uncle Bob Hawkins wears six pairs of stockin's Whenever he's out on the squid-jiggin' ground.  God bless my sou'wester\, there's Skipper John Chaffey He's the best hand at squid-jiggin' here\, I'll be bound Hello! What's the row? Why\, he's jiggin' one now The very first squid on the squid-jiggin' ground.  Holy smoke! What a scuffle! All hands are excited 'Tis a wonder to me that there's nobody drowned There's a bustle\, confusion\, a wonderful hustle They're all jiggin' squid on the squid-jiggin' ground.  Says Bobby\, "The squids are on top of the water\, I just got me jigger 'bout one fathom down" When a squid in the boat squirted right down his throat And he's swearin' like mad on the squid-jiggin' ground.  There's poor Uncle Bille\, his whiskers are spattered With spots of the squid juice that's flyin' around; One poor little b'y got it right in the eye But they don't give a damn on the squid-jiggin' ground.  Now if ever you feel inclined to go squiddin' Leave your white shirts and collars behind in the town And if you get cranky without yer silk hanky You'd better steer clear of the squid-jiggin' ground.	0

COL title VAL Some Other Guy COL performer VAL The Smithereens	COL video title VAL Elly Lapp - Jonny wenn du Geburtstag hast.wmv COL channel name VAL schwarzantigone COL description VAL Elly Lapp Ganz nah  Genre: Deutsch-Pop\, Chanson\, Schlager   „Eine Stimme die unter die Haut geht.  Eindringlich\, lasziv\, ganz nah."   Elly Lapp liebt die Brückenschläge. Für sie sind UFA-Schlager und Popmusik keine  unarrangierbaren Gegensätze\, sondern interpretatorische Herausforderung. Dabei ist eine sehr moderne CD entstanden\,  die gleichzeitig sehr intensiv und sehr persönlich ist. Viel näher geht`s nicht.   Es waren große Songs -- es sind große Songs. Dazu leistet eine interessante Interpretin ihren Beitrag. Elly Lapp. Die studierte Schauspielerin und Sängerin tourt mit eigenen Programmen durch Deutschland -- und sie war die Stimme des Titelsongs der erfolgreichen ARD-Fernsehserie „Kir Royal".  „Der Wind hat mir ein Lied erzählt" - gleichzeitig erste Single - und „Ich steh` im Regen" sind Versuche einer ungewöhnlichen Verbindung von UFA - HIT und POPSOUND. Zarah Leander machte einst diese Songs zu Welterfolgen. Damals hatten die Autoren wohl nie eine Umsetzung mit rockigen Gitarren oder Saxophon im Auge. Hier geben die modernen Instrumente\, wie das gesamte Pop- Arrangement\, eine ganz neue Farbe -- voller Intensität.  Doch die CD von Elly Lapp zeigt die großen Filmhits nicht nur im Popgewand\, sondern auch sehr sparsam\, kunstvoll arrangiert\, als Chansons mit großer interpretatorischer Tiefe.  z.B." Wenn ich mir was wünschen dürfte" und - vor allem - „Der Nowack lässt mich nicht verkommen" -\, ein wahrer Kultsong\, 1959 geschrieben\, sofort auf Schallplatte aufgenommen\, kurzerhand von einem Münchner Gericht verboten und wieder eingestampft -- eine echte Rarität für jedes Rundfunk- und Privatarchiv!	0

Her style was a hybrid of Brill Building-style New York pop\, jazz\, gospel\, rhythm and blues\, show tunes\, rock and soul.  She was best known\, and enjoyed her greatest commercial success\, as a composer and lyricist rather than as a performer. Between 1968 and 1970 a number of other singers had significant hits with her songs: The 5th Dimension with "Blowing Away"\, "Wedding Bell Blues"\, "Stoned Soul Picnic"\, "Sweet Blindness"\, "Save The Country" and "Black Patch"; Blood\, Sweat & Tears and Peter\, Paul & Mary with "And When I Die"; Three Dog Night with "Eli's Coming"; and Barbra Streisand with "Stoney End"\, "Time and Love"\, and "Hands off the Man (Flim Flam Man)". Nyro's best-selling single was her recording of Carole King and Gerry Goffin's "Up on the Roof."   Lyrics:  Loving you so I was too blind to see you letting me go But now that you've set me free It's gonna take a miracle Yes\, it's gonna take a miracle To make me love someone new Cause I'm crazy for you  Oh oh\, didn't you know It wouldn't be so easy lettin' you go I could have told you that it's gonna take a miracle  oh-uh Yes\, it's gonna take a miracle To make me love someone new Cause I'm crazy for you  Oh\, tho' I know I can't forget? about you or come so? will show you how much You're turning me around\, destroying me I'll never be the same anymore  You must realize You took your love and left me Quite by surprise You can be sure that now it's gonna take a miracle Yes\, it's gonna take a miracle To make me love someone new Cause I'm crazy for you	0

COL title VAL So Long COL performer VAL Ella Fitzgerald and Her Famous Orchestra	COL video title VAL ALBERT HAMMOND - When you tell me that you love me -Class Master- -demo unplugged- COL channel name VAL Jose Luis Montecristo COL description VAL Sir Albert Hammond (nombrado Oficial de Honor de la Orden del Imperio Británico por la Reina Isabel II de Inglaterra por su aportación al mundo de la música) ha vendido más de 360 millones de discos en todo el mundo con sus canciones\, interpretadas por él mismo y por otros grandes artistas de la talla de Julio Iglesias\, Willie Nelson\, Whitney Houston\, Diana Ross\, Luz Casal\, Starhip... Las canciones de Albert Hammond han liderado las listas de éxitos internacionales tanto de pop como de R&B\, country\, de estilo "adult contemporary" y de música latina\, con frecuencia de manera simultánea. Entre esas canciones se incluyen conocidos números 1 como "When I Need You"\, "Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now" (nominada a los Oscar®\, los Globos de Oro y los Grammy)\, "One Moment in Time" y "To All the Girls I've Loved Before". Auténticos himnos musicales como "One Moment in  Time"\, una canción que compuso para que se convirtiera en el tema oficial de los Juegos Olímpicos en 1988 y que llevó a Albert a recibir su primer Emmy\, y "Cantaré\, Cantarás" (el equivalente en el mercado de música en español del clásico "We Are the World")\, un tema que Albert co-escribió y produjo\, son dos ejemplos de la capacidad de Albert Hammond para componer canciones que se instalan desde el principio en el inconsciente colectivo de millones de personas.  Albert es un experto colaborador con un gran talento con la guitarra\, el piano y la interpretación vocal\, y ha formado  parte de algunos de los equipos de compositores con mayor éxito en la industria discográfica. Junto a su colega en labores de composición Mike Hazlewood\, con el que ha trabajado durante muchos años\, ha co-escrito muchos de sus éxitos\, entre ellos el clásico "The Air that I Breathe". Además\, Albert ha co-escrito grandes temas de éxito junto a Diane Warren\, entre ellos el famoso "I Don't Wanna Live Without Your Love" de Chicago\, "Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now" de Starship\, "Careless Heart" de Roy Orbison\, "Don't You Love Me Anymore" de Joe Cocker y "Don't Turn Around"\, una canción que ha alcanzado el éxito en tres ocasiones en las voces de Ace of Base\, Neil Diamond y el grupo Aswad. Asimismo\, Albert también ha compuesto  diversos éxitos junto a Hal David ("99 Miles from L.A." y "To All the Girls I've Loved Before") y John Bettis ("One Moment  in Time"\, "When You Tell Me That You Love Me" y "I Need To Be In Love"\, el gran éxito que popularizó el grupo The  Carpenters).  Entre las estrellas que han grabado canciones compuestas por Albert Hammond se encuentran muchos de los artistas más importantes del panorama musical contemporáneo\, incluyendo a Celine Dion\, Whitney Houston\, Aretha Franklin\, Tina Turner\, Elton John\, Joe Cocker\, Diana Ross\, Johnny Cash\, K.D. Lang\, Julio Iglesias y Josh Groban\, entre otros grandes nombres.  En 2008 Albert recibió la invitación para incorporarse al prestigioso Songwriter's Hall of Fame\, y también ha recibido la Orden del Imperio Británico (OBE) de manos de Su Majestad la Reina Isabel II de Inglaterra. Gibraltar\, la ciudad donde creció\, ofrecerá próximamente un homenaje a Albert Hammond a través de la edición de una serie de sellos postales conmemorativos que incluirán su imagen y destacarán asimismo sus mayores éxitos internacionales.	0

I've never found it on any CD\, and I doubt it will ever be reissued. This dub is from a mint promo copy.  Its a little too gummy to be called Power Pop\, but its a fun record. It almost beats the Rubinoos at their own game. It was only a mid-charting hit\, though I remember KLAW and KSWO in Lawton OK giving it a few spins back in the summer of 1977.   And I've never found another 45 by this group. Were they a studio group or a real band?   And if that Scott Shannon on the label is the DJ who now runs the "True Oldies" network and has programmed so many legendary Top 40-CHR radio stations in the past - thanks for a great record.. too bad it didnt do better!	0

Purchase from the label: http://www.paradiseofbachelors.com/shop/pob-21 Purchase from Bandcamp: https://paradiseofbachelors.bandcamp.com/album/ambsace Other options: http://lnk.to/PoB21  The second album of astonishing duets by guitarists James Elkington (who has toured and/or recorded with Jeff Tweedy\, Richard Thompson\, and Steve Gunn\, among others) and Nathan Salsburg (an accomplished soloist deemed by NPR “one of those names we’ll all associate with American folk guitar”) is a sublime suite of nimble\, filigreed compositions by two singular stylists. Belying its title—“ambsace” is the lowest throw of dice; snake eyes—the record thrives on a gentle empathy and generosity of spirit\, sitting sneakily protean original compositions alongside gorgeous arrangements of songs by Duke Ellington and The Smiths at the same big hand-hewn table.

Your poison letter\, your telegram. They go to show you don't give a damn.  Since you been gone\, since you been gone. I'm out of my head can't take it. Could I be wrong\, but since you ben gone.

COL title VAL Willow Song COL performer VAL Doves	COL video title VAL NYSF Threepenny Opera - 07 - Liebeslied (Look at the Moon over Soho) COL channel name VAL AnonNietzsche COL description VAL This is an LP transfer of the 1976 New York Shakespeare Festival's revival production of "The Threepenny Opera."  This recording should not be confused with the original 1954 New York production recording\, nor the 1994 Donmar Warehouse production recording in England.  Unlike Marc Blitzstein's version which ran during the 1950's for six years and featured the incomparable Lotte Lenya\, this translation is less sanitized and more in keeping with the seedy and sexual nature of the original german play.    From the liner notes to the album - "the successful Blitzstein version was an adaptation rather than a translation\, and in comparing it to the original\, we were surprised at the extent to which his treatment vitiated the political and sexual thrust which gives the work its relentless power.  Blitzstein sweetened and cleaned up Brecht's unsparing lyrics\, partially in deference to stage censorship...but in doing so he in many instances changed Brecht's meanings around entirely\, and throughout he softened the impact of Brecht's biting ferocity.  He also attempted to make the lyrics more 'singable' by fitting them into conventional musical patterns\, and in this he succeeded admirably."  The translation used for this revival was prepared by Ralph Maheim and John Willett; the full text can be found in their edition of Brecht's Collected Plays\, Volume 2.  A hardcover edition was also published in conjunction with the revival.  This revival was directed by conceptual theater artist Richard Foreman\, and starred Raul Julia and Ellen Greene\, both of whom were nominated for Tony Awards.  It was produced by Joseph Papp and the New York Shakespeare Festival at the Vivian Beaumont Theatre at Lincoln Center.  Additional information regarding the production\, including cast list\, can be found at the Internet Broadway Database's listing for this revival at http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=3835 ...  As of June 2007\, this cast album has not been released or reissued on CD; it was originally made available in 1976 on LP\, and this is an LP transfer.  As such\, the quality is not CD quality  - there will occasionally be noise\, popping\, or hissing.

COL title VAL Handyman COL performer VAL Frank Black	COL video title VAL Little Birdie - Vernon Dalhart COL channel name VAL althazarr's good time oldies COL description VAL Recorded on September 19\, 1925 under the pseudonym of Al Craver. Dalhart was born in Jefferson\, Texas. He took his stage name from two towns\, Vernon and Dalhart in Texas\, between which he punched cattle in the 1890s. Dalhart's father\, Robert Marion Slaughter was killed by his brother-in-law\, Bob Castleberry\, when Vernon was age 10. When Vernon was 12 or 13\, the family moved from Jefferson to Dallas\, Texas. Vernon\, who already could play the jaw harp and harmonica\, received vocal training at the Dallas Conservatory of Music. He married Sadie Lee Moore-Livingston in 1901 and had two children\, a son and a daughter. Around 1910 the family moved to New York City. He found employment in a piano warehouse and took occasional singing jobs. One of his first roles was in Giacomo Puccini's opera Girl of the Golden West; following this he played the part of Ralph Rackstraw in a production of HMS Pinafore. He also played the part of Lieutenant Pinkerton in Madame Butterfly.  He saw an advertisement in the local newspaper for singers and applied\, and was auditioned by Thomas Alva Edison; he would thereafter make numerous records for Edison Records. From 1916 until 1923\, using numerous pseudonyms\, he made over 400 recordings of light classical music and early dance band vocals for various record labels. He was already an established singer when he made his first country music recordings which cemented his place in music history. Dalhart's 1924 recording of "The Wreck of the Old 97"—a classic American railroad ballad about the September 27\, 1903 derailment of Southern Railway Fast Mail train No. 97 near Danville\, Virginia—for the Victor Talking Machine Company\, became a runaway hit\, alerting the national record companies to the existence of a sizable market for country-style vocals. It became the first Southern song to become a national success. The double-sided single eventually sold more than seven million copies\, a colossal number for a mid-1920s recording. It was the best-selling single to its time\, and was the biggest-selling non-holiday record in the first 70 years of recorded music. Research by Billboard statistician Joel Whitburn determined "The Prisoner's Song" to have been a No. 1 hit for 12 weeks in 1925-26. In 1998\, "The Prisoner's Song" was honored with a Grammy Hall of Fame Award and the Recording Industry Association of America named it one of the Songs of the Century. It was the desire of the Victor Talking Machine Company to duplicate the sales success of 'Wreck/Prisoner' that led them to contract with Ralph S. Peer to go to the southern mountains in the Summer of 1927 to facilitate 'The Bristol Sessions'\, arguably the single-most important recording event in the history of country music\, where Jimmie Rodgers and the original Carter Family were first discovered\, and after which\, Peer's royalty model would become the standard of the entire recorded music industry. He recorded under a host of pseudonyms given to him by recording managers. On Grey Gull Records he often used the pseudonym Vel Veteran\, which was however also used by other singers\, including Arthur Fields (Fields also used the pseudonym "Mr. X"). It is thought that Dalhart had the most recordings of any person in history. To some\, Dalhart's Southern accent seemed artificial. In a 1918 interview Dalhart said\, "When you are born and brought up in the South your only trouble is to talk any other way...the sure 'nough Southerner talks almost like a Negro\, even when he's white. I've broken myself of the habit\, more or less\, in ordinary conversation\, but it still comes pretty easy." While some country music purists always viewed Dalhart with some suspicion because of his light opera background and a vocal style that was closer to pop than country\, he was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970\, into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1981 and into the Gennett Records Walk of Fame in 2007. Dalhart died in Bridgeport\, Connecticut in 1948 and is interred there in the Mountain Grove Cemetery.	0

COL title VAL Ooh La La COL performer VAL Faces	COL video title VAL Red Foley Hang Your Head In Shame COL channel name VAL Marcus Brazil COL description VAL Foley was an inspiration to rock 'n' roll\, in particular Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley\, who both covered many of his songs. His country boogie material was a clear precursor of the style.  Foley has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: one for his recording career at\, 6225 Hollywood Blvd. and one for his television career\, at 6300 Hollywood Blvd. On June 10\, 2003\, a Kentucky State historical marker (No. 2114) was placed at Foley's boyhood home in Berea.  In 2002\, he was inducted into the Kentucky Music Hall of Fame\, where his corncob pipe is on display. In 2006\, his 1951 version of "Peace in the Valley" was entered into the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry.  In 1970\, Berea College established the Red Foley Memorial Music Award. Initiated by his long-time friend and colleague Si Siman\, the annual award is presented to talented Berea College students in recognition of their musical contributions to the campus community. It is intended to promote the music associated with Foley’s career\, such as folk\, country\, bluegrass\, gospel and popular music.  A dance to Foley's song\, "The Salty Dog Rag"\, has been traditional at Dartmouth College since 1972\, where it is taught to freshman during orientation.[21][22] Cumberland Falls State Park\, in Corbin\, Kentucky\, near Foley's hometown of Berea\, has been playing the song with an accompanying dance at its square dance nights since at least the mid-1970s.  The Rooks Van Dellen Residence Hall at Calvin College has an annual celebration of Red Foley Day in mid-November. The celebration began in 1968 when a few students from the hall heard a radio announcer say\, "Red Foley was a great country music singer\, too bad no one will ever remember him." The day has been celebrated (with a few lapses) to remember Foley ever since.[23][24]  Foley Middle School\, located in Berea near Foley's boyhood home\, opened in 1978 and educates students in southern Madison County in the 6th\, 7th\, and 8th grades. The school retains a large collection of personal items once owned by Foley on display in the library. The collection was donated by members of his family.  Red Foley Court is among several streets in Nixa\, Missouri named for performers on Ozark Jubilee\, and Red Foley Road is in Rockcastle County\, Kentucky\, north of Renfro Valley.[25]  In 2009\, singer/songwriter James Power released a song based on Foley's second wife\, Eva Overstake (aka Judy Martin)\, entitled "A Cowgirl's Suicide" on YouTube.[26] The song was featured in the independent film Laid Off by director John Launchi.	0

Purchase from the label: http://www.paradiseofbachelors.com/shop/pob-21 Purchase from Bandcamp: https://paradiseofbachelors.bandcamp.com/album/ambsace Other options: http://lnk.to/PoB21  The second album of astonishing duets by guitarists James Elkington (who has toured and/or recorded with Jeff Tweedy\, Richard Thompson\, and Steve Gunn\, among others) and Nathan Salsburg (an accomplished soloist deemed by NPR “one of those names we’ll all associate with American folk guitar”) is a sublime suite of nimble\, filigreed compositions by two singular stylists. Belying its title—“ambsace” is the lowest throw of dice; snake eyes—the record thrives on a gentle empathy and generosity of spirit\, sitting sneakily protean original compositions alongside gorgeous arrangements of songs by Duke Ellington and The Smiths at the same big hand-hewn table.

ANYWAYS...  So yes\, the cover has finally released and I could not be more anxious to hear what y'all think about it. I actually DID the vocal track several months ago\, but kept it to myself for a bit\, for fear of it not being good enough heh. I ended up releasing that track on Loudr (see link above)\, but for the video release\, something still didn't feel quite right. For those who have heard the Loudr track\, you will notice some obvious changes :) This was EASILY the most difficult track I've ever done\, and I hope that you will all enjoy it just as much as I did making it :D  (crazy video fx FTW!! :P)  Thank you all again for your continued support throughout this crazy journey of mine lol Let's make 2015 an unbelievable year\, together ;)  Song: Defying Gravity from Wicked The Musical Mixed\, Edited\,and Filmed by Caleb Hyles	0

Hear the pipes are calling\, Loudly and proudly calling\, Down thro' the glen. There where the hills are sleeping\, Now feel the blood a-leaping\, High as the spirits of the old Highland men.  Towering in gallant fame\, Scotland my mountain hame\, High may your proud standards gloriously wave\, Land of my high endeavour\, Land of the shining river\, Land of my heart for ever\, Scotland the brave.  High in the misty Highlands\, Out by the purple islands\, Brave are the hearts that beat Beneath Scottish skies. Wild are the winds to meet you\, Staunch are the friends that greet you\, Kind as the love that shines from fair maiden's eyes.  Towering in gallant fame\, Scotland my mountain hame\, High may your proud standards gloriously wave\, Land of my high endeavour\, Land of the shining river\, Land of my heart for ever\, Scotland the brave.  Far off in sunlit places\, Sad are the Scottish faces\, Yearning to feel the kiss Of sweet Scottish rain. Where tropic skies are beaming\, Love sets the heart a-dreaming\, Longing and dreaming for the homeland again.  Towering in gallant fame\, Scotland my mountain hame\, High may your proud standards gloriously wave\, Land of my high endeavour\, Land of the shining river\, Land of my heart for ever\, Scotland the brave. Land of my heart for ever\, Scotland the brave.	0

COL title VAL Skyfall COL performer VAL Jaimee Paul	COL video title VAL NYSF Threepenny Opera - 07 - Liebeslied (Look at the Moon over Soho) COL channel name VAL AnonNietzsche COL description VAL This is an LP transfer of the 1976 New York Shakespeare Festival's revival production of "The Threepenny Opera."  This recording should not be confused with the original 1954 New York production recording\, nor the 1994 Donmar Warehouse production recording in England.  Unlike Marc Blitzstein's version which ran during the 1950's for six years and featured the incomparable Lotte Lenya\, this translation is less sanitized and more in keeping with the seedy and sexual nature of the original german play.    From the liner notes to the album - "the successful Blitzstein version was an adaptation rather than a translation\, and in comparing it to the original\, we were surprised at the extent to which his treatment vitiated the political and sexual thrust which gives the work its relentless power.  Blitzstein sweetened and cleaned up Brecht's unsparing lyrics\, partially in deference to stage censorship...but in doing so he in many instances changed Brecht's meanings around entirely\, and throughout he softened the impact of Brecht's biting ferocity.  He also attempted to make the lyrics more 'singable' by fitting them into conventional musical patterns\, and in this he succeeded admirably."  The translation used for this revival was prepared by Ralph Maheim and John Willett; the full text can be found in their edition of Brecht's Collected Plays\, Volume 2.  A hardcover edition was also published in conjunction with the revival.  This revival was directed by conceptual theater artist Richard Foreman\, and starred Raul Julia and Ellen Greene\, both of whom were nominated for Tony Awards.  It was produced by Joseph Papp and the New York Shakespeare Festival at the Vivian Beaumont Theatre at Lincoln Center.  Additional information regarding the production\, including cast list\, can be found at the Internet Broadway Database's listing for this revival at http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=3835 ...  As of June 2007\, this cast album has not been released or reissued on CD; it was originally made available in 1976 on LP\, and this is an LP transfer.  As such\, the quality is not CD quality  - there will occasionally be noise\, popping\, or hissing.

COL title VAL Baby\, Come Back COL performer VAL The Equals	COL video title VAL the temptations- i know i'm losing you COL channel name VAL Motown Deep Cuts\, PAMS Jingles & More with Tomovox COL description VAL A cold day in Hell...  The horrifying ring of truth- what it feels like to know you're losing someone you love...  Eddie Kendricks\, Melvin Franklin\, Otis Williams and Paul Williams are brothers of misery singing out the storm warning of failed love just around the bend.  A chorus keeping their emotions in check until they come to that hook line:  "Losing You-oooo"  where the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end...  David Ruffin.  The poor man is in so much anguish and yet his vocals never go completely off the rails.  The amazing thing about David and company is how much emotion they pack into those lyrics while keeping the singing just one step away from total abandon.  Economy in vocalizing\, not "over-singing"; sometimes it's those tightly controlled vocals that tear your guts out- you get the feeling the man is about to combust at any moment and you're just waiting for the other shoe to drop...	0

In 1969 John Elliot – sax\, joined the group and in 1970 Ivor Black – drums and Peter Vee – lead vocals (Steve Lonsdale left for America).

Lyrics:  Once I was seven years old my mama told me\,  Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely Once I was seven years old  It was a big\, big world but we thought we were bigger Pushing each other to the limits\, we were learning quicker By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor  Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure  Once I was eleven years old my daddy told me\,  Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely Once I was eleven years old  I always had that dream like my daddy before me So I started writing songs\, I started writing stories Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me ‘Cause only those I really love will ever really know me  Once I was twenty years old my story got told Before the morning sun when life was lonely Once I was twenty years old  I only see my goals I don't believe in failure ‘Cause I know the smallest voices they can make it major I got my boys with me\, at least those in favor And if we don't meet before I leave I hope I'll see you later  Once I was twenty years old my story got told  I waswriting 'bout everything I saw before me Once I was twenty years old  Soon we'll be thirty years old\, our songs have been sold  We'vetraveled around the world and we're still roaming Soon we'll be thirty years old  I'm still learning about life\, my woman brought children for me So I can sing them all my songs and I can tell them stories Most of my boys are with me\, some are still out seeking glory And some I had to leave behind\, my brother I'm still sorry  Soon I'll be sixty years old\, my daddy got sixty-one  Remember life and then your life becomes a better one I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month  Soon I'll be sixty years old\, will I think the world is cold Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me Soon I'll be sixty years old  #OfficialMusicVideo #LukasGraham #7Years #WeAreWarnerRecords	0

COL title VAL Rub It in COL performer VAL Layng Martine	COL video title VAL Kim Wilde - A Little Respect COL channel name VAL José Teixeira COL description VAL #kimwilde - A Little Respect  Song written and originally recorded by Erasure.  Erasure version The British synthpop duo Erasure released 'A Little Respect' in September 1988 as their tenth single. The single was taken from their album 'The Innocents'. The lyric is an empowering plea to a lover to show compassion and respect.  Kim Wilde version Kim Wilde performed this song live during her European tour in March/April 2009 and subsequent festival performances in the summer of 2009. She continued to perform the song in 2010 and during the 'Come Out and Play' tour in March 2011. In August 2011 the song was released as a studio recording on Kim's album Snapshots.  Kim about 'A little respect' 'A Little Respect' is a great song by Erasure\, Vince Clark and Andy Bell\, and I remember it came out in 1988 which was a really important year for me. I had 'Close' out which did really well\, and of course I was on tour with Michael Jackson\, so it all kindof kicked off that year. Every time I hear this song it just takes me back to that fantastic time in my career.  Andy Bell absolutely loved it and has told us so\, so that's one of the reasons why it's on [Pop Don't Stop\, the greatest hits compilation]. It was fully endorsed by him and he loves it\, so that means the world to us. Source: https://www.wilde-life.com/encyclopedia/a/a-little-respect  Lyrics: I try to discover A little something to make me sweeter Oh baby refrain from breaking my heart I'm so in love with you I'll be forever blue That you give me no reason Why you're making me work so hard  That you give me no That you give me no That you give me no That you give me no  Soul\, I hear you calling Oh baby please give a little respect to me  And if I should falter Would you open your arms out to me We can make love not war And live at peace in our hearts I'm so in love with you I'll be forever blue What religion or reason Could drive a man to forsake his lover  Don't you tell me no Don't you tell me no Don't you tell me no Don't you tell me no  Soul\, I hear you calling Oh baby please give a little respect to me  I'm so in love with you I'll be forever blue That you give me no reason You know you're making me work so hard  That you give me no That you give me no That you give me no That you give me no  Soul\, I hear you calling Oh baby please give a little respect to me Soul\, I hear you calling Oh baby please give a little respect to me	0

COL title VAL Back in My Arms Again COL performer VAL Cynthia Manley	COL video title VAL Average White Band ~ If I Ever Lose This Heaven "1975" Funk COL channel name VAL 2chann COL description VAL Their self-effacing name to the contrary\, Average White Band was anything but -- one of the few white groups to cross the color line and achieve success and credibility playing funk\, with their tight\, fiery sound also belying their Scottish heritage\, evoking American R&B hotbeds like Detroit\, Memphis\, and Philadelphia instead. Singer/bassist Alan Gorrie\, guitarists Hamish Stuart and Onnie McIntyre\, tenor saxophonist Malcolm Duncan\, keyboardist/saxophonist Roger Ball\, and drummer Robbie McIntosh comprised the original Average White Band lineup. Veterans of numerous Scottish soul and jazz groups\, they made their debut in 1973 as the opening act at Eric Clapton's Rainbow Theatre comeback gig\, soon issuing their debut LP\, Show Your Hand\, to little notice. After adopting the abbreviated moniker AWB\, a year later the band issued their self-titled sophomore effort\, topping the American pop charts with the Arif Mardin-produced instrumental "Pick Up the Pieces." The record's mammoth success was nevertheless tempered by the September 23\, 1974 death of McIntosh\, who died at a Hollywood party after overdosing on heroin.  Cut the Cake Ex-Bloodstone drummer Steve Ferrone replaced McIntosh for AWB's third album\, 1975's Cut the Cake\, which scored a Top Ten hit with its title track as well as two other chart entries\, "If I Ever Lose This Heaven" and "School Boy Crush." (Put It Where You Want It\, issued later that same year\, was simply a retitled and repackaged Show Your Hand.) With 1976's Soul Searching\, the group reclaimed the full Average White Band name\, scoring their final Top 40 hit with "Queen of My Soul." Following the live Person to Person\, they issued Benny & Us\, a collaboration with soul legend Ben E. King. However\, after subsequent outings\, including 1978's Warmer Communications\, 1979's Feel No Fret\, and 1980's Shine\, failed to recapture the energy of AWB's peak\, the group dissolved in 1982\, with Ferrone later joining Duran Duran and Stuart recording with Paul McCartney. Gorrie\, Ball\, and McIntyre reformed Average White Band in 1989\, tapping vocalist Alex Ligertwood for their comeback effort Aftershock. Oft-sampled by hip-hop producers throughout the 1990s\, the group continued touring prior to releasing Soul Tattoo in 1996. The live album\, Face to Face\, followed three years later.

I love the music of Clarence White & decided it was time to put some out. It's a great listen & was made as learning tapes to be given as gifts to his friends. It was found after his sudden death at age 29\, killed by a drunk driver. This was a tape\, recorded by Ry Cooder in White's home in early tape days. He was with The Byrds\, The New KY Colonels\, backed Emmylou & Gram\, Jackson Browne\, The Everly Bros\,the supergroup Muleskinner (look up the members)\, Gene Watston\,Arlo Guthrie...almost anyone who was playing good music at the time. Many believe he would have been the crossover giant in music if not for his untimely death. He steered clear of drugs & booze. Tony Rice & Marty Stuart bought 2 of his guitars due to their respect for him. Enjoy!	1

It was released on their debut album A Flock of Seagulls in 1982 and was its most successful single\, reaching number 9 in the United States and number 1 in Australia.  Single  The single was promoted by a distinctive music video in which the band members performed in a room covered in aluminum foil and mirrors. The cameras used to film the video are clearly visible in many of the background reflections\, their stands also covered in foil. The video is a homage to Brian Eno and Robert Fripp's (No Pussyfooting) album cover\, which was also respectively portrayed by The Strokes for their single\, "The End Has No End" two decades later. The video received heavy rotation on MTV in the summer of 1982\, and helped the single to become a hit. The video features a different edit of "I Ran" than the album version; the introduction was greatly shortened.  The band toured the United States extensively to promote the single\, supporting Squeeze on their 1982 tour. As well as reaching #9 on the Billboard Hot 100\, "I Ran" peaked at #3 on the Mainstream Rock chart and #8 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. Subsequently the album reached number 10 on the Billboard 200.  Despite success in the States and Australia\, the single did not enjoy similar success in the band's home country (United Kingdom)\, failing to make the top 40.  In an interview on the VH1 special 100 Greatest Songs of the '80s\, Mike Score said that he resents the song\, but plays it live because people enjoy it. "I Ran" was listed at #55 on the countdown. In VH1's 100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders of the 80s\, the song was listed at #2\, with Mike Score's interview played again.  Although considered an '80s New Wave classic\, the song experienced somewhat of a revival in 2002 as the signature theme for the video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City; being played during the game's television commercials and during gameplay as one of the songs in the playlist for radio station Wave 103.  Along with the Bowling for Soup cover\, it was also used as the theme song for the English dub of the anime series Knights of the Zodiac which was later removed from the air during its first season.  The song briefly featured in the Dead Zone Season 2 episode 'Playing God'\, heard during a party scene. It can also be heard during a nightclub scene in the 2005 Nick Love film The Business.  The master recording is available as a playable song in Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s as well as the rebooted version of Karaoke Revolution. The song was from the TV show Everybody Hates Chris entitled Everybody Hates the Last Day  It was performed by the Ska Rangers in the film The Hangover: Part II during the closing scene.  Also\, Fez sung a verse in That 70's Show during one of the "Circles" in the fourth season's opener.  Cover versions  "I Ran" has been covered by a number of artists:  Tori Amos covered the song on her Original Sinsuality/Summer Of Sin Tour in Denver\, during Piano Bar Time. Her version was released with the rest of the show in the 3rd CD of The Original Bootlegs.  Assemblage 23 recorded the song for the 1997 compilation Newer Wave.  Cranial Screwtop recorded a version of the song for their 2006 album "Too Fast for Technology".  Terminal Choice's cover of the song is included on the bonus disk of their 2006 album New Born Enemies.  Bowling for Soup covered the song for the 2003 re-release of their album Drunk Enough to Dance and their "Punk Rock 101" single. Both the original and the punk cover are the theme song of the American version of Saint Seiya\, also known as Knights of the Zodiac.  Hidden in Plain View recorded the song on the covers compilation album Punk Goes 80s.  In Dance Dance Revolution: Hottest Party 2\, Spacebar vs Naughty G covered this song.  Darude and Blake Lewis released a cover in 2008.  Nickelback covered the song during their Dark Horse Tour in 2010. It was sung by guitarist/vocalist Ryan Peake.  Slim Thug also took the bass line of this song to produce his single "I Run"  Umphrey's Mcgee covered the song during a performance at the Birmingham Southern College on 4/9/05\, however they have played it many times before.  Ska Rangers covered the song which featured on the film and soundtrack of The Hangover: Part II.	1

COL title VAL Esto es amor COL performer VAL Evangelina Elizondo	COL video title VAL LUTHER INGRAM-ain't hat loving you(for more reason than one) COL channel name VAL pieroangelo2 COL description VAL Born Luther Thomas Ingram in Jackson\, Tennessee\, his early interest in music led to him making his first record in 1965 at the age of 28. His first three recordings failed to chart but that changed when he signed for KoKo Records in the late 1960s\, and his first hit "My Honey And Me" peaked at #55 on the Hot 100 on 14 February 1970. Many of his songs appeared in the pop and R&B charts\, even though Koko was only a small label\, owned by his manager and record producer\, Johnny Baylor. Koko and Baylor were closely associated with the Memphis based Stax Records label during the height of its commercial success.   Ingram is best known for the hit\, "(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want to Be Right"\, written by Homer Banks\, Carl Hampton and Raymond Jackson. The song reached number one on Billboard 's R&B chart and peaked at number three on that publication's Hot 100 chart in the summer of 1972. The track stayed in the Hot 100 for 18 weeks\, ultimately selling a reported four million copies.[1] The song was later successfully covered by Millie Jackson and Barbara Mandrell; it has also been recorded by Bobby "Blue" Bland\, Rod Stewart and Isaac Hayes.   Other popular tracks for Ingram included "Ain't That Loving You (For More Reasons Than One)"\, "Let's Steal Away To The Hideaway" and "I'll Be Your Shelter." He also co-authored "Respect Yourself"\, a million seller for the Staples Singers in 1971.[1] The acetate demo version of Ingram's\, "Exus Trek"\, became a sought after Northern soul track.[2] With the Stax connections\, Ingram recorded at the Memphis label's studios\, as well as other southern-based studios such as Muscle Shoals. He was opening act for Isaac Hayes for some years\, and often used Hayes' Movement band and female backing group for his 1970s recordings. He recorded into the 1980s\, and whilst only managing lower R&B chart hits\, he remained a popular stage draw.   Ingram died on March 19\, 2007\, at a Belleville\, Illinois\, hospital of heart failure. According to his wife Jacqui Ingram\, he had suffered for years from diabetes\, kidney disease and partial blindness	0

COL title VAL Daj mi lovu COL performer VAL Riblja Čorba	COL video title VAL Kim Wilde - A Little Respect COL channel name VAL José Teixeira COL description VAL #kimwilde - A Little Respect  Song written and originally recorded by Erasure.  Erasure version The British synthpop duo Erasure released 'A Little Respect' in September 1988 as their tenth single. The single was taken from their album 'The Innocents'. The lyric is an empowering plea to a lover to show compassion and respect.  Kim Wilde version Kim Wilde performed this song live during her European tour in March/April 2009 and subsequent festival performances in the summer of 2009. She continued to perform the song in 2010 and during the 'Come Out and Play' tour in March 2011. In August 2011 the song was released as a studio recording on Kim's album Snapshots.  Kim about 'A little respect' 'A Little Respect' is a great song by Erasure\, Vince Clark and Andy Bell\, and I remember it came out in 1988 which was a really important year for me. I had 'Close' out which did really well\, and of course I was on tour with Michael Jackson\, so it all kindof kicked off that year. Every time I hear this song it just takes me back to that fantastic time in my career.  Andy Bell absolutely loved it and has told us so\, so that's one of the reasons why it's on [Pop Don't Stop\, the greatest hits compilation]. It was fully endorsed by him and he loves it\, so that means the world to us.

Her style was a hybrid of Brill Building-style New York pop\, jazz\, gospel\, rhythm and blues\, show tunes\, rock and soul.  She was best known\, and enjoyed her greatest commercial success\, as a composer and lyricist rather than as a performer. Between 1968 and 1970 a number of other singers had significant hits with her songs: The 5th Dimension with "Blowing Away"\, "Wedding Bell Blues"\, "Stoned Soul Picnic"\, "Sweet Blindness"\, "Save The Country" and "Black Patch"; Blood\, Sweat & Tears and Peter\, Paul & Mary with "And When I Die"; Three Dog Night with "Eli's Coming"; and Barbra Streisand with "Stoney End"\, "Time and Love"\, and "Hands off the Man (Flim Flam Man)". Nyro's best-selling single was her recording of Carole King and Gerry Goffin's "Up on the Roof."   Lyrics:  Loving you so I was too blind to see you letting me go But now that you've set me free It's gonna take a miracle Yes\, it's gonna take a miracle To make me love someone new Cause I'm crazy for you  Oh oh\, didn't you know It wouldn't be so easy lettin' you go I could have told you that it's gonna take a miracle  oh-uh Yes\, it's gonna take a miracle To make me love someone new Cause I'm crazy for you  Oh\, tho' I know I can't forget? about you or come so? will show you how much You're turning me around\, destroying me I'll never be the same anymore  You must realize You took your love and left me Quite by surprise You can be sure that now it's gonna take a miracle Yes\, it's gonna take a miracle To make me love someone new Cause I'm crazy for you	1

Don't sent your kinfolk to give me no talkin' I'll be gone\, like I said.  You'd just say the same old thing That you be sayin' all along\, Just lay there in your bed and keep your mouth shut\, Till I'm gone. Don't give me that old familiar cry and fuss and moan  Understand your man\, I'm tired of your bad-mouthin' Understand your man.  You can give my other suit to the Salvation Army\, And everything else I leave behind I ain't takin' nothin' that'll slow down my travelin' While I'm untanglin' my mind.

He came across this young man pickin' on a guitar\, playing it hot an' An' the devil jumped on a hickory stump an' said 'I'll tell ya what' I guess you didn't know it\, I'm a guitar player too\, and if you care to take a dare I make a bet with you. Now you play a real good guitar boy\, but give the devil his due\, I'll bet a guitar of gold against you soul 'cause i think i'm better then you.  The boy said my name's Johnny\, it might be a sin\, i'll take your bet You're gonna regret\, I'm the best I've ever been.  Johnny rosen up your pick an' play your guitar hard 'cause hell's broke loose in scunthorpe an' the devil deals the cards. Now if you win you'll get this shinny guitar made of gold\, but if you loose the devil gets your soul!  The devil opened up his case and said 'i'll start this gig' and fire flew from his finger tips as he rosened up his pick. He strummed the pick across the strings it made an evil hiss Then a band of demons joined in and it sounded somthing like this  When the devil finished Johnny said 'You're pretty good ol' son\, but sit down in that chair right there let me show you how it's done!'

Both songs were originally sung by Ben E. King and made the R&B top 20\, and "I'll Be There" also reached number 12 on the pop chart. In 1962 she recorded "Dance With a Dolly (With a Hole in her Stocking"\, previously made famous by The Andrews Sisters and Bill Haley\, for Mercury Records. In 1966 she had a minor hit with a cover of the Jacques Brel song "If You Go Away."   She worked with Ray Charles\, Count Basie\, and Lionel Hampton. And\, in 1963\, she released a recording for Mercury Records with Billy Eckstine and Bobby Tucker Orchestra.   Damita Jo was later involved in comedy and toured with Redd Foxx.

COL title VAL Love Hangover COL performer VAL Junior Walker	COL video title VAL You're Just In Love - Perry Como COL channel name VAL Maureen712 COL description VAL "You're Just in Love" is a popular song by Irving Berlin. It was published in 1950 and was first performed by Ethel Merman and Russell Nype in Call Me Madam\, a musical comedy that debuted at the Imperial Theatre in New York City on October 12 that year. The show ran for 644 performances. Ethel Merman also later starred in the 1953 film version. Theatre lore has it that Berlin wrote the song one night after Call Me Madam was not doing well in tryouts. The second act of the show was lacking. "What I'd like to do is a song with the kid (Russell Nype)\," Merman said. So\, Berlin went to his room and later produced the counterpoint song. When Berlin played the song for Merman\, she said "We'll never get off the stage." According to Berlin's biographer though\, Berlin played the song for Russell Nype first\, but admonished him not to admit he did so because it would infuriate Merman.  Several recorded versions made the charts in 1950-51: by Perry Como and The Fontane Sisters\, by Rosemary Clooney and Guy Mitchell\, and by Ethel Merman and Dick Haymes.  The Perry Como/Fontane Sisters version was recorded on September 26\, 1950 and released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number 20-3945. The record first reached the Billboard magazine charts on December 22\, 1950 and lasted 17 weeks on the chart\, peaking at #5.  The Rosemary Clooney/Guy Mitchell version was recorded on October 21\, 1950 and released by Columbia Records as catalog number 39052. The record first reached the Billboard magazine charts on February 23\, 1951 and lasted 2 weeks on the chart\, peaking at #29.  The Ethel Merman/Dick Haymes version was recorded on October 17\, 1950 and released by Decca Records as catalog number 27317. The record first reached the Billboard magazine charts on March 30\, 1951 and lasted 1 week on the chart\, at #30. Although the lowest charting of the three\, it got a considerable amount of airplay in subsequent years.  Musically\, the song is one of Irving Berlin's three well-known songs that use true counterpoint—a main melody with a secondary melody running at the same time\, both with independent lyrics - his two other best-known counterpoint songs are Play a Simple Melody and "An Old-Fashioned Wedding" (see the 1966 revival of "Annie Get Your Gun").	0

COL title VAL I'm a Dreamer (Aren't We All) COL performer VAL Vincent Lopez & His Orchestra	COL video title VAL Red Foley Hang Your Head In Shame COL channel name VAL Marcus Brazil COL description VAL Foley was an inspiration to rock 'n' roll\, in particular Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley\, who both covered many of his songs. His country boogie material was a clear precursor of the style.  Foley has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: one for his recording career at\, 6225 Hollywood Blvd. and one for his television career\, at 6300 Hollywood Blvd. On June 10\, 2003\, a Kentucky State historical marker (No. 2114) was placed at Foley's boyhood home in Berea.  In 2002\, he was inducted into the Kentucky Music Hall of Fame\, where his corncob pipe is on display. In 2006\, his 1951 version of "Peace in the Valley" was entered into the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry.  In 1970\, Berea College established the Red Foley Memorial Music Award. Initiated by his long-time friend and colleague Si Siman\, the annual award is presented to talented Berea College students in recognition of their musical contributions to the campus community. It is intended to promote the music associated with Foley’s career\, such as folk\, country\, bluegrass\, gospel and popular music.  A dance to Foley's song\, "The Salty Dog Rag"\, has been traditional at Dartmouth College since 1972\, where it is taught to freshman during orientation.[21][22] Cumberland Falls State Park\, in Corbin\, Kentucky\, near Foley's hometown of Berea\, has been playing the song with an accompanying dance at its square dance nights since at least the mid-1970s.  The Rooks Van Dellen Residence Hall at Calvin College has an annual celebration of Red Foley Day in mid-November. The celebration began in 1968 when a few students from the hall heard a radio announcer say\, "Red Foley was a great country music singer\, too bad no one will ever remember him." The day has been celebrated (with a few lapses) to remember Foley ever since.[23][24]  Foley Middle School\, located in Berea near Foley's boyhood home\, opened in 1978 and educates students in southern Madison County in the 6th\, 7th\, and 8th grades. The school retains a large collection of personal items once owned by Foley on display in the library. The collection was donated by members of his family.  Red Foley Court is among several streets in Nixa\, Missouri named for performers on Ozark Jubilee\, and Red Foley Road is in Rockcastle County\, Kentucky\, north of Renfro Valley.[25]  In 2009\, singer/songwriter James Power released a song based on Foley's second wife\, Eva Overstake (aka Judy Martin)\, entitled "A Cowgirl's Suicide" on YouTube.[26] The song was featured in the independent film Laid Off by director John Launchi.	0

Luister zonder advertenties met YouTube Premium  Rotterdams mondorgeltrio rond Geert van Driesten. Ze beleven hun hoogtijdagen in de jaren vijftig en begin jaren zestig\, met als hoogtepunt het optreden in de show van Dorus 1935 - 1945 Geert van Driesten richt\, geïnspireerd door de Amerikaanse mondharpgroep Borrah Minevitch & his Harmonica Rascals\, The 5 Hotcha's (Mexicaans voor 'muzikale zwerver') op. Aanvankelijk spelen ze veel in Engeland\, met de beroemde band van Jack Hylton. Ook spelen de Hotcha's tot de oorlog in Parijs\, Brussel en verschillende steden in Duitsland.   1945 - 1950 Minevitch vraagt Driesten om naar Amerika te komen. Driesten bedankt voor de eer en in plaats daarvan richt hij de Eerste Nederlandse Chromatische Mondharmonica School op. Driesten stelt zich ten doel om\, met behulp van deze school in Rotterdam\, de mondharp als serieus concertinstrument geaccepteerd te krijgen. Daarnaast is hij nog steeds de voorman van de Hotcha's\, inmiddels teruggebracht tot Hotcha Trio met Eddy Sernee en Joop Heijman. Met hun clowneske show en allerhande idioterie groeit de faam van het Hotcha Trio gestaag.  1950 - 1960 In 1951 neemt het Hotcha Trio hun eerste plaatje op: een 78-toerenplaat met het lied Honeysuckle Rose en op de B-kant Chattanoogie Shoe Shine Boy. Sernee heeft inmiddels plaatsgemaakt voor Henk van Dipte\, die akkoorden speelt op de 'rol' (acht tot een cilinder samengeklonken harmonica's in verschillende toonsoorten). Driesten speelt op de basharmonica en Heijman is de solist. De swingende\, energieke liedjes van de Hotcha's weten een alsmaar groeiend publiek aan te spreken. Het trio komt veelvuldig op de radio en later ook op televisie in de show van Dorus.  1960 - 1970 De eerste jaren van de jaren zestig is het Hotcha Trio nog steeds erg populair. Het repertoire van het trio verandert echter onder de druk van de oprukkende beatmuziek: de jazz van liedjes als Honeysuckle Rose heeft plaatsgemaakt voor meedeiners als Der Onkel Jonathan en De Zilvervloot. Het variété-tijdperk is zo langzamerhand afgelopen\, de tijdgeest is veranderd en de populariteit van de Hotcha's neemt razendsnel af. Een bijkomend probleem is dat de akkoordenspelers nooit lang trouw blijven aan het trio: na Van Dipte volgen achtereenvolgens Lee Kuipers\, Gijs van der Wiel\, Jan Vuik en Frans Pauli. In 1970 besluit Van Driesten in stilte om een punt te zetten achter de ooit zo glansrijke carrière van het Hotcha Trio.	0

Join our Youtube: https://goo.gl/8AOGaN Join our Facebook: http://goo.gl/5oL723 Robert Leroy Johnson (May 8\, 1911 -- August 16\, 1938 ) was an American blues singer and musician. His landmark recordings from 1936--37 display a combination of singing\, guitar skills\, and songwriting talent that has influenced later generations of musicians. Johnson's shadowy\, poorly documented life and death at age 27 have given rise to much legend\, including the Faustian myth that he sold his soul at a crossroads to achieve success. As an itinerant performer who played mostly on street corners\, in juke joints\, and at Saturday night dances\, Johnson had little commercial success or public recognition in his lifetime.

There are women and women and  some hold you tight while some leave you counting the  stars in the night.	0

COL title VAL One COL performer VAL Die Krupps	COL video title VAL Eiffel 65 - Blue (Da Ba Dee) COL channel name VAL malawolf85 COL description VAL Eiffel 65 is a three man (Gianfranco Randone\, Maurizio Lobina\, and Gabriele Ponte) Italian eurodance group. Best know for their international hit "Blue (Da Ba Dee)" Eiffel 65's debut album "Europop" sold over two million units in the US\, making them the best selling Italian eurodance group ever in the United States. The origin of the group's name is an interesting sequence of chance. The name "Eiffel" was chosen randomly by a computer program and the "65" was scribbled onto their name on a demo by mistake; it was actually part of a phone number. The group Eiffel 65 is also known for their many remixes of songs from other artists\, with over thirty of them to their name. In 2005 Gabriele Ponte left the group to focus on his solo career and in 2006 the reminding members left the Bliss Corporation to form their own duo called Bloom 06. The Bliss Corporation\, who owns the name Eiffel 65\, had announced a new line up for the group would be debuting in the summer of 2007 however the debut was postponed until further notice.	0

You Got It Coming (Supertonic Remix)  ------------------------  "R.A.M.O.N.E.S." is a song first recorded by the British rock band Motörhead on their 1991 album 1916 as a tribute to their friends and contemporaries\, the Ramones. The bands were long-standing admirers of each other's work. Critic Andy Boot\, reviewing the album in Kerrang (27 February 1991) described the song as "the icing on a very fine\, if somewhat heavy\, cake."  "It was the ultimate honor - like John Lennon writing a song for you". -Joey Ramone  The track was first aired before Phil Taylor and Würzel left the band and has continued as a live staple.  Cover versions  It also appears as a bonus track on the album Fang Bang by Wednesday 13.  The Ramones also performed it on and off until their final show in August 1996 at which C.J. Ramone and Lemmy shared lead vocals. Two different studio versions were recorded. One appears as a bonus track on their album ¡Adios Amigos! with C.J. Ramone singing lead vocals and the other one on the Greatest Hits Live with Joey Ramone singing lead vocals.  The Huntingtons also covered this song on their File Under Ramones album.  "R.A.M.O.N.E.S." was also covered by the Offspring on their performance at Rock in Rio 5 on September 14\, 2013. At that show\, Marky Ramone (who was the drummer of the Ramones from 1978 to 1983\, and again from 1987 to their breakup in 1996) joined them onstage to perform cover versions of "R.A.M.O.N.E.S." and "California Sun".  ------------------------  Lyrics  New York City\, N.Y.C.

COL title VAL From Four Until Late COL performer VAL Jim Byrnes	COL video title VAL FOUR UNTIL LATE (1937) by Robert Johnson COL channel name VAL wilson mcphert COL description VAL I first heard 'Four Until Late' sung by Eric Clapton on the Fresh Cream album. It was one of the first songs I learned on guitar\, and one I still like doing.  .   Robert Johnson\, of course\, was the author of the song (although clearly influenced by Blind Blake's 'Georgia Bound'- see my video). In 1937\, he travelled to Dallas\, Texas\, for his second and final recording session in a makeshift studio at the Brunswick Record Building\, 508 Park Avenue. He recorded this song on 19 June 1937.   It goes without saying that Johnson was one of the most influential blues singers in history. Wikipedia has a substantial profile on him.   There are only two photos of Johnson that I know of\, and I have used these and others to make a slideshow video.   Comments are welcome.	1

When questioned who had sent for him\,  He answered with his thumb\,  For his tongue it could not speak\, but only flatter.   He stayed behind the assembly hall\,  It was there he made his bed\,  Oftentimes he could be seen returning.  Until one day he just appeared  With a note in his hand which read\,  "The soles of my feet\, I swear they're burning."   Oh\, the leaves began to fallin'  And the seas began to part\,  And the people that confronted him were many.  And he was told but these few words\,  Which opened up his heart\,  "If ye cannot bring good news\, then don't bring any."   I do not own this. All rights belong to the respective owners.	0

Growing up in an artistic\, politically engaged family in the Bronx\, he became an early rock 'n' roll convert after attending an Alan Freed rock 'n' roll revue that included performances by Chuck Berry\, Buddy Holly\, Jerry Lee Lewis\, Little Richard and Frankie Lymon.  His thirst for new and old sounds drove him to exploring blues\, soul\, country\, folk and jazz\, inspiring weekly visits to Harlem's Apollo Theatre and leading to acquaintances with many of the music's surviving originators.   Wolf's talent as a painter won him a grant to study at the Boston Museum School of Fine Arts.  While a student there\, he experienced a life-changing epiphany after jumping on stage to sing with a blues band at a loft party.  He soon talked himself into membership in that band\, The Hallucinations.   "I didn't join a band to meet girls\," Wolf recalls.  "I joined my first band to meet musicians.  Painting was a fascination for me\, but I was a music fanatic\, and sitting in with that band was a born-again type of experience for me.  I was transfixed\, and myself and some of the guys in the band would check out performances by the musicians we admired so much\, like Muddy Waters and John Lee Hooker and John Coltrane and Bill Monroe and the Stanley Brothers.  Those roots stayed with me."	0

COL title VAL Yer Blues COL performer VAL Eugene McGuinness	COL video title VAL Little Birdie - Vernon Dalhart COL channel name VAL althazarr's good time oldies COL description VAL Recorded on September 19\, 1925 under the pseudonym of Al Craver. Dalhart was born in Jefferson\, Texas. He took his stage name from two towns\, Vernon and Dalhart in Texas\, between which he punched cattle in the 1890s. Dalhart's father\, Robert Marion Slaughter was killed by his brother-in-law\, Bob Castleberry\, when Vernon was age 10. When Vernon was 12 or 13\, the family moved from Jefferson to Dallas\, Texas. Vernon\, who already could play the jaw harp and harmonica\, received vocal training at the Dallas Conservatory of Music. He married Sadie Lee Moore-Livingston in 1901 and had two children\, a son and a daughter. Around 1910 the family moved to New York City. He found employment in a piano warehouse and took occasional singing jobs. One of his first roles was in Giacomo Puccini's opera Girl of the Golden West; following this he played the part of Ralph Rackstraw in a production of HMS Pinafore. He also played the part of Lieutenant Pinkerton in Madame Butterfly.  He saw an advertisement in the local newspaper for singers and applied\, and was auditioned by Thomas Alva Edison; he would thereafter make numerous records for Edison Records. From 1916 until 1923\, using numerous pseudonyms\, he made over 400 recordings of light classical music and early dance band vocals for various record labels. He was already an established singer when he made his first country music recordings which cemented his place in music history. Dalhart's 1924 recording of "The Wreck of the Old 97"—a classic American railroad ballad about the September 27\, 1903 derailment of Southern Railway Fast Mail train No. 97 near Danville\, Virginia—for the Victor Talking Machine Company\, became a runaway hit\, alerting the national record companies to the existence of a sizable market for country-style vocals. It became the first Southern song to become a national success. The double-sided single eventually sold more than seven million copies\, a colossal number for a mid-1920s recording. It was the best-selling single to its time\, and was the biggest-selling non-holiday record in the first 70 years of recorded music. Research by Billboard statistician Joel Whitburn determined "The Prisoner's Song" to have been a No. 1 hit for 12 weeks in 1925-26. In 1998\, "The Prisoner's Song" was honored with a Grammy Hall of Fame Award and the Recording Industry Association of America named it one of the Songs of the Century. It was the desire of the Victor Talking Machine Company to duplicate the sales success of 'Wreck/Prisoner' that led them to contract with Ralph S. Peer to go to the southern mountains in the Summer of 1927 to facilitate 'The Bristol Sessions'\, arguably the single-most important recording event in the history of country music\, where Jimmie Rodgers and the original Carter Family were first discovered\, and after which\, Peer's royalty model would become the standard of the entire recorded music industry. He recorded under a host of pseudonyms given to him by recording managers. On Grey Gull Records he often used the pseudonym Vel Veteran\, which was however also used by other singers\, including Arthur Fields (Fields also used the pseudonym "Mr. X"). It is thought that Dalhart had the most recordings of any person in history. To some\, Dalhart's Southern accent seemed artificial. In a 1918 interview Dalhart said\, "When you are born and brought up in the South your only trouble is to talk any other way...the sure 'nough Southerner talks almost like a Negro\, even when he's white. I've broken myself of the habit\, more or less\, in ordinary conversation\, but it still comes pretty easy." While some country music purists always viewed Dalhart with some suspicion because of his light opera background and a vocal style that was closer to pop than country\, he was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970\, into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1981 and into the Gennett Records Walk of Fame in 2007. Dalhart died in Bridgeport\, Connecticut in 1948 and is interred there in the Mountain Grove Cemetery.	0

COL title VAL The Forty Shades of Green COL performer VAL Seamus Kennedy	COL video title VAL Bette Bright - Some Girls Have All The Luck COL channel name VAL PassionateFriend COL description VAL This is track nine of the only Bette Bright & The Illuminations album. It is now out of print and fairly pricey\, so here's a vinyl rip for your enjoyment. Bette Bright was originally a prominent vocalist with Liverpool legends Deaf School before her solo career. This album features the likes of Clive Langer\, Ian Broudie\, James Eller and Lee "Kix" Thompson of Madness. Bette Bright (real name Anne Martin) married Graham "Suggs" McPherson (no introduction necessary) and retired from music to start a family. Recently\, however\, she has re-emerged along with Deaf School\, playing several reunion and tribute gigs. Oh and any eagle-eyes among us will have spotted a red-wigged Bette in the Sex Pistols movie Rock 'N' Roll Swindle (check the scene where Steve Jones...soils the gold record). Enjoy and t'interweb Bette's name for loads more information.	0

COL title VAL Different Drum COL performer VAL Victoria Shaw	COL video title VAL NASHVILLE WEST (ft. Clarence White) - "Mental Revenge" - 1967 COL channel name VAL BobSeger1981 COL description VAL Nashville West included: Clarence White (Byrds)\, Gene Parsons\, Gib Guibeau and Wayne Moore. This is from the 1967\, self-titled\, album.  There are a few records that can be considered birthplaces of what has become known as "country-rock." Two Gene Clark albums\, Echoes and Fantastic Expedition\, come to mind\, as well as the Byrds' Sweetheart of the Rodeo and the International Submarine Band's debut. Add to that list -- and put it high up there -- Nashville West\, a self-titled debut by a group that consisted of Gib Guilbeau\, Wayne Moss\, and two future Byrds\, Gene Parsons and the great Clarence White\, and it's White's awesome guitar work that puts this album in a legendary context. Aside from the revolutionary playing by White\, the group has a forceful yet laid-back groove that\, if you like it on the first cut\, "Nashville West\," will have you digging the whole record. Parsons' drumming has a slightly soulful edge\, which predates the Flying Burrito Brothers' experiments by several years. One of the best cuts on the album is a cover of "Ode to Billy Joe\," which has White and Parsons laying into a groove that is indescribably delicious. Ignoring the historical value of this CD\, the whole record is a hell of a lot of fun.  Vocally\, not really what you'd call a masterpiece\, but it doesn't matter -- Nashville West is a record that should be owned by any fan of the Byrds\, the Flying Burrito Brothers\, Dillard & Clark\, and country music as a genre. Brilliant. ~ Matthew Greenwald	0

COL title VAL Dear Hearts and Gentle People COL performer VAL Gordon MacRae with Andy Parker and The Plainsmen	COL video title VAL the temptations- i know i'm losing you COL channel name VAL Motown Deep Cuts\, PAMS Jingles & More with Tomovox COL description VAL A cold day in Hell...  The horrifying ring of truth- what it feels like to know you're losing someone you love...  Eddie Kendricks\, Melvin Franklin\, Otis Williams and Paul Williams are brothers of misery singing out the storm warning of failed love just around the bend.  A chorus keeping their emotions in check until they come to that hook line:  "Losing You-oooo"  where the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end...  David Ruffin.  The poor man is in so much anguish and yet his vocals never go completely off the rails.  The amazing thing about David and company is how much emotion they pack into those lyrics while keeping the singing just one step away from total abandon.  Economy in vocalizing\, not "over-singing"; sometimes it's those tightly controlled vocals that tear your guts out- you get the feeling the man is about to combust at any moment and you're just waiting for the other shoe to drop...	0

Credited as simply Damita Jo\, DeBlanc had some chart success in the early 1960s with two answer songs: 1960's "I'll Save the Last Dance for You" (an answer to "Save the Last Dance for Me") and 1961's "I'll Be There" (an answer to "Stand By Me"). Both songs were originally sung by Ben E. King and made the R&B top 20\, and "I'll Be There" also reached number 12 on the pop chart. In 1962 she recorded "Dance With a Dolly (With a Hole in her Stocking"\, previously made famous by The Andrews Sisters and Bill Haley\, for Mercury Records. In 1966 she had a minor hit with a cover of the Jacques Brel song "If You Go Away."   She worked with Ray Charles\, Count Basie\, and Lionel Hampton.

Autry was also owner of a television station\, several radio stations in Southern California\, and the Los Angeles/California/Anaheim Angels Major League Baseball team from 1961 to 1997.  From 1934 to 1953\, Autry appeared in 93 films and 91 episodes of The Gene Autry Show television series. During the 1930s and 1940s\, he personified the straight-shooting hero—honest\, brave\, and true—and profoundly touched the lives of millions of Americans. Autry was also one of the most important figures in the history of country music\, considered the second major influential artist of the genre's development after Jimmie Rodgers.[2] His singing cowboy movies were the first vehicle to carry country music to a national audience. ] In addition to his signature song\, "Back in the Saddle Again"\, Autry is still remembered for his Christmas holiday songs\, "Here Comes Santa Claus"\, which he wrote\, "Frosty the Snowman"\, and his biggest hit\, "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer".  Autry is a member of both the Country Music Hall of Fame and Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame\, and is the only person to be awarded stars in all five categories on the Hollywood Walk of Fame\, for film\, television\, music\, radio\, and live performance. The town of Gene Autry\, Oklahoma was named in his honor.	0

Barring a moderately successful reissue of their Australian single "Spicks and Specks"\, it was the first single release of the group's international career and their first song to hit the charts in the US or UK. The song was released on 14 April 1967. It was produced by their manager Robert Stigwood with Ossie Byrne. The song was the first track of side two on the group's international debut album Bee Gees' 1st. The first single with Australian drummer Colin Petersen as an official member of the band.  Recording  On 7 March\, the Bee Gees recorded "New York Mining Disaster 1941" in six takes\, along with three other songs: "I Can't See Nobody"\, "Red Chair\, Fade Away" and "Turn of the Century". The orchestra and some other parts were added on 13 March. "New York Mining Disaster 1941" was done first\, and it may have already been nominated as the first single on the strength of the Polydor demo. However\, this version was not released until 2006.  Legacy  The 1969 David Bowie song "Space Oddity" owes a debt to the style\, arrangement and lyrics of "New York Mining Disaster 1941". Like "New York Mining Disaster 1941"\, "Space Oddity" is about a trapped man who is doomed to die\, and the song is similarly structured as a series of statements addressed to another person.  "Space Oddity was a Bee Gees type song\," Bowie's colleague John "Hutch" Hutchinson has said. "David knew it\, and he said so at the time\, the way he sang it\, it's a Bee Gees thing."  As Marc Bolan explained: "I remember David playing me 'Space Oddity' in his room and I loved it and he said he needed a sound like the Bee Gees\, who were very big then".  Paul McCartney said: "It was the 'Mining Disaster' song that [Robert Stigwood] played me. I said 'sign them\, they're great!'. And they went on to be even greater".  In the 1970 film Cucumber Castle\, in which the Bee Gees starred minus Robin\, Maurice's character begins to sing this song while playing the banjo\, only to end abruptly when a pie is thrown at his face - possibly a humorous reference to the fact that Maurice was not involved in the writing of the song.  Cover versions  Ashton\, Gardner and Dyke recorded a version of this song for their self-titled debut album from 1969.  The Sorrows recorded this song in early 1969 as part of a demo album that was prepared before the release of their second album Old Songs New Songs; however\, the song remained unreleased until it was included in a two-CD reissue of that album by Wooden Hill in 2009.  David Essex recorded another version of this song for his 1993 covers album Cover Shot.  British anarchist band Chumbawamba recorded a "minimalist" version for their 2000 album\, WYSIWYG.  The Levellers covered the song as a B-side to their single Bozos.  It has also been performed by folksinger Martin Carthy.  In 2008 singer songwriter Trevor Tanner released a version entitled Mr. Jones on his album Eaten By The Sea.  In 2011 Australian bush punk act Handsome Young Strangers covered the song as a B-side to their single Sweet As A Nut and then included it on their album Here's The Thunder Lads!.  Mark Newman recorded a version of "New York Mining Disaster\, 1941 on his cd\, "Must Be A Pony" on Danal Music in 2006.	0

Don't sent your kinfolk to give me no talkin' I'll be gone\, like I said.  You'd just say the same old thing That you be sayin' all along\, Just lay there in your bed and keep your mouth shut\, Till I'm gone. Don't give me that old familiar cry and fuss and moan  Understand your man\, I'm tired of your bad-mouthin' Understand your man.  You can give my other suit to the Salvation Army\, And everything else I leave behind I ain't takin' nothin' that'll slow down my travelin' While I'm untanglin' my mind.  I ain't gonna repeat What I said any more While I'm breathin' air that ain't been breathed before\, I'll be just as gone as the wild goose in winter  Then you'll understand your man\, meditate on it Understand your man\, you hear me talking Understand your man. Remember what I told you Understand your man Understand your man Written by Johnny R. Cash • Copyright © Warner/Chappell Music\, Inc https://play.google.com/music/preview/Tyczwzmbrbajoevxfsctw7b4sq4?lyrics=1&utm_source=google&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign=lyrics&pcampaignid=kp-songlyrics .  From Wikipedia\, the free encyclopedia "Understand Your Man" is a 1964 single by Johnny Cash.[1] The single went to number one on the country charts for six weeks.[2] "Understand Your Man" also crossed over to the Top 40\, peaking at number 35.[3]  Cash borrowed parts of the melody from Bob Dylan's "Don't Think Twice\, It's All Right".[4]  "Understand Your Man" was also the last song Cash ever performed in front of an audience. It was the last song in his performance at the Carter Family Fold in Hiltons\, Virginia\, on 5 July 2003. Prior to singing it\, Cash told the audience that at that point he had not performed it live in 25 years. (It was not\, however\, the final song he ever sang as despite failing health he continued to make studio recordings until late August 2003\, shortly before his death.)

Las canciones de Albert Hammond han liderado las listas de éxitos internacionales tanto de pop como de R&B\, country\, de estilo "adult contemporary" y de música latina\, con frecuencia de manera simultánea. Entre esas canciones se incluyen conocidos números 1 como "When I Need You"\, "Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now" (nominada a los Oscar®\, los Globos de Oro y los Grammy)\, "One Moment in Time" y "To All the Girls I've Loved Before". Auténticos himnos musicales como "One Moment in  Time"\, una canción que compuso para que se convirtiera en el tema oficial de los Juegos Olímpicos en 1988 y que llevó a Albert a recibir su primer Emmy\, y "Cantaré\, Cantarás" (el equivalente en el mercado de música en español del clásico "We Are the World")\, un tema que Albert co-escribió y produjo\, son dos ejemplos de la capacidad de Albert Hammond para componer canciones que se instalan desde el principio en el inconsciente colectivo de millones de personas.  Albert es un experto colaborador con un gran talento con la guitarra\, el piano y la interpretación vocal\, y ha formado  parte de algunos de los equipos de compositores con mayor éxito en la industria discográfica. Junto a su colega en labores de composición Mike Hazlewood\, con el que ha trabajado durante muchos años\, ha co-escrito muchos de sus éxitos\, entre ellos el clásico "The Air that I Breathe". Además\, Albert ha co-escrito grandes temas de éxito junto a Diane Warren\, entre ellos el famoso "I Don't Wanna Live Without Your Love" de Chicago\, "Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now" de Starship\, "Careless Heart" de Roy Orbison\, "Don't You Love Me Anymore" de Joe Cocker y "Don't Turn Around"\, una canción que ha alcanzado el éxito en tres ocasiones en las voces de Ace of Base\, Neil Diamond y el grupo Aswad. Asimismo\, Albert también ha compuesto  diversos éxitos junto a Hal David ("99 Miles from L.A." y "To All the Girls I've Loved Before") y John Bettis ("One Moment  in Time"\, "When You Tell Me That You Love Me" y "I Need To Be In Love"\, el gran éxito que popularizó el grupo The  Carpenters).  Entre las estrellas que han grabado canciones compuestas por Albert Hammond se encuentran muchos de los artistas más importantes del panorama musical contemporáneo\, incluyendo a Celine Dion\, Whitney Houston\, Aretha Franklin\, Tina Turner\, Elton John\, Joe Cocker\, Diana Ross\, Johnny Cash\, K.D. Lang\, Julio Iglesias y Josh Groban\, entre otros grandes nombres.  En 2008 Albert recibió la invitación para incorporarse al prestigioso Songwriter's Hall of Fame\, y también ha recibido la Orden del Imperio Británico (OBE) de manos de Su Majestad la Reina Isabel II de Inglaterra. Gibraltar\, la ciudad donde creció\, ofrecerá próximamente un homenaje a Albert Hammond a través de la edición de una serie de sellos postales conmemorativos que incluirán su imagen y destacarán asimismo sus mayores éxitos internacionales.	1

COL title VAL The Way Young Lovers Do COL performer VAL Jeff Buckley	COL video title VAL The Mar-Keys - Last Night COL channel name VAL englishnbloodyproudo COL description VAL The Mar-Keys\, formed in 1958\, were an American studio session band for the Stax label from Memphis\, Tennessee\, in the 1960s. As the first house band for the label\, their backing music formed the foundation for the early 1960s Stax sound.  The group began as The Royal Spades and had tried unsuccessfully to get a record made for the local Satellite Records even though tenor sax player Charles "Packy" Axton's mother and uncle owned that label. When they were finally able to get a record made\, Axton's mother Estelle Axton convinced the group to change their name and they chose The Mar-Keys.  They also recorded organ and saxophone oriented singles of their own\, scoring a number three hit nationally with "Last Night" in 1961. It sold over one million copies\, earning gold disc recognition. Keyboards were played by Jerry Lee "Smoochy" Smith. Other singles of theirs from the early 1960s include "Philly Dog" and "Popeye Stroll." Members of this rhythm section later formed other nationally prominent Memphis studio session groups\, including the Memphis Horns\, the Packers\, and Booker T. & the M.G.'s. Each of these offshoot groups also recorded popular instrumental albums of their own\, in addition to serving as the backing band on albums by dozens of rock\, R&B\, and soul music stars on Stax\, Volt and other national labels. The legacy of the Mar-Keys and later groups was that of having been key players in the development of soul music styles like Southern soul and Memphis soul.	0

Fall to the groudn and I wak up. So I get out of bed\, put on my shoes. And in my head thoughts slide back to the break up. These four walls are closing in. Think of the fix\, you put me in.  Since you been gone\, since you been gone. I'm out of my head can't take it. Could I be wrong\, but since you ben gone. You cast a spell so break it.  So in the night I stand\, beneath the back street light. I read the words that you sent to me. I can take the afternoon but night time comes around too soon. You can't know what you mean to me. Your poison letter\, your telegram. They go to show you don't give a damn.  Since you been gone\, since you been gone. I'm out of my head can't take it. Could I be wrong\, but since you ben gone. You cast a spell so break it. Since you been gone  Since you been gone\, since you been gone. I'm out of my head can't take it. Could I be wrong\, but since you ben gone.

Clarence White) - "Mental Revenge" - 1967 COL channel name VAL BobSeger1981 COL description VAL Nashville West included: Clarence White (Byrds)\, Gene Parsons\, Gib Guibeau and Wayne Moore. This is from the 1967\, self-titled\, album.  There are a few records that can be considered birthplaces of what has become known as "country-rock." Two Gene Clark albums\, Echoes and Fantastic Expedition\, come to mind\, as well as the Byrds' Sweetheart of the Rodeo and the International Submarine Band's debut. Add to that list -- and put it high up there -- Nashville West\, a self-titled debut by a group that consisted of Gib Guilbeau\, Wayne Moss\, and two future Byrds\, Gene Parsons and the great Clarence White\, and it's White's awesome guitar work that puts this album in a legendary context. Aside from the revolutionary playing by White\, the group has a forceful yet laid-back groove that\, if you like it on the first cut\, "Nashville West\," will have you digging the whole record. Parsons' drumming has a slightly soulful edge\, which predates the Flying Burrito Brothers' experiments by several years. One of the best cuts on the album is a cover of "Ode to Billy Joe\," which has White and Parsons laying into a groove that is indescribably delicious. Ignoring the historical value of this CD\, the whole record is a hell of a lot of fun.  Vocally\, not really what you'd call a masterpiece\, but it doesn't matter -- Nashville West is a record that should be owned by any fan of the Byrds\, the Flying Burrito Brothers\, Dillard & Clark\, and country music as a genre. Brilliant. ~ Matthew Greenwald	0

You Got It Coming (Supertonic Remix)  ------------------------  "R.A.M.O.N.E.S." is a song first recorded by the British rock band Motörhead on their 1991 album 1916 as a tribute to their friends and contemporaries\, the Ramones. The bands were long-standing admirers of each other's work. Critic Andy Boot\, reviewing the album in Kerrang (27 February 1991) described the song as "the icing on a very fine\, if somewhat heavy\, cake."  "It was the ultimate honor - like John Lennon writing a song for you". -Joey Ramone  The track was first aired before Phil Taylor and Würzel left the band and has continued as a live staple.  Cover versions  It also appears as a bonus track on the album Fang Bang by Wednesday 13.  The Ramones also performed it on and off until their final show in August 1996 at which C.J. Ramone and Lemmy shared lead vocals. Two different studio versions were recorded. One appears as a bonus track on their album ¡Adios Amigos! with C.J. Ramone singing lead vocals and the other one on the Greatest Hits Live with Joey Ramone singing lead vocals.  The Huntingtons also covered this song on their File Under Ramones album.  "R.A.M.O.N.E.S." was also covered by the Offspring on their performance at Rock in Rio 5 on September 14\, 2013. At that show\, Marky Ramone (who was the drummer of the Ramones from 1978 to 1983\, and again from 1987 to their breakup in 1996) joined them onstage to perform cover versions of "R.A.M.O.N.E.S." and "California Sun".  ------------------------  Lyrics  New York City\, N.Y.C.

It was released on their debut album A Flock of Seagulls in 1982 and was its most successful single\, reaching number 9 in the United States and number 1 in Australia.  Single  The single was promoted by a distinctive music video in which the band members performed in a room covered in aluminum foil and mirrors. The cameras used to film the video are clearly visible in many of the background reflections\, their stands also covered in foil. The video is a homage to Brian Eno and Robert Fripp's (No Pussyfooting) album cover\, which was also respectively portrayed by The Strokes for their single\, "The End Has No End" two decades later. The video received heavy rotation on MTV in the summer of 1982\, and helped the single to become a hit. The video features a different edit of "I Ran" than the album version; the introduction was greatly shortened.  The band toured the United States extensively to promote the single\, supporting Squeeze on their 1982 tour. As well as reaching #9 on the Billboard Hot 100\, "I Ran" peaked at #3 on the Mainstream Rock chart and #8 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. Subsequently the album reached number 10 on the Billboard 200.  Despite success in the States and Australia\, the single did not enjoy similar success in the band's home country (United Kingdom)\, failing to make the top 40.  In an interview on the VH1 special 100 Greatest Songs of the '80s\, Mike Score said that he resents the song\, but plays it live because people enjoy it. "I Ran" was listed at #55 on the countdown. In VH1's 100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders of the 80s\, the song was listed at #2\, with Mike Score's interview played again.  Although considered an '80s New Wave classic\, the song experienced somewhat of a revival in 2002 as the signature theme for the video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City; being played during the game's television commercials and during gameplay as one of the songs in the playlist for radio station Wave 103.  Along with the Bowling for Soup cover\, it was also used as the theme song for the English dub of the anime series Knights of the Zodiac which was later removed from the air during its first season.  The song briefly featured in the Dead Zone Season 2 episode 'Playing God'\, heard during a party scene. It can also be heard during a nightclub scene in the 2005 Nick Love film The Business.  The master recording is available as a playable song in Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s as well as the rebooted version of Karaoke Revolution. The song was from the TV show Everybody Hates Chris entitled Everybody Hates the Last Day  It was performed by the Ska Rangers in the film The Hangover: Part II during the closing scene.  Also\, Fez sung a verse in That 70's Show during one of the "Circles" in the fourth season's opener.  Cover versions  "I Ran" has been covered by a number of artists:  Tori Amos covered the song on her Original Sinsuality/Summer Of Sin Tour in Denver\, during Piano Bar Time. Her version was released with the rest of the show in the 3rd CD of The Original Bootlegs.  Assemblage 23 recorded the song for the 1997 compilation Newer Wave.  Cranial Screwtop recorded a version of the song for their 2006 album "Too Fast for Technology".  Terminal Choice's cover of the song is included on the bonus disk of their 2006 album New Born Enemies.  Bowling for Soup covered the song for the 2003 re-release of their album Drunk Enough to Dance and their "Punk Rock 101" single. Both the original and the punk cover are the theme song of the American version of Saint Seiya\, also known as Knights of the Zodiac.  Hidden in Plain View recorded the song on the covers compilation album Punk Goes 80s.  In Dance Dance Revolution: Hottest Party 2\, Spacebar vs Naughty G covered this song.  Darude and Blake Lewis released a cover in 2008.  Nickelback covered the song during their Dark Horse Tour in 2010. It was sung by guitarist/vocalist Ryan Peake.  Slim Thug also took the bass line of this song to produce his single "I Run"  Umphrey's Mcgee covered the song during a performance at the Birmingham Southern College on 4/9/05\, however they have played it many times before.  Ska Rangers covered the song which featured on the film and soundtrack of The Hangover: Part II.	0

The horrifying ring of truth- what it feels like to know you're losing someone you love...  Eddie Kendricks\, Melvin Franklin\, Otis Williams and Paul Williams are brothers of misery singing out the storm warning of failed love just around the bend.  A chorus keeping their emotions in check until they come to that hook line:  "Losing You-oooo"  where the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end...  David Ruffin.  The poor man is in so much anguish and yet his vocals never go completely off the rails.  The amazing thing about David and company is how much emotion they pack into those lyrics while keeping the singing just one step away from total abandon.  Economy in vocalizing\, not "over-singing"; sometimes it's those tightly controlled vocals that tear your guts out- you get the feeling the man is about to combust at any moment and you're just waiting for the other shoe to drop...	0

COL title VAL Hang Your Head in Shame COL performer VAL Red Foley	COL video title VAL Bob Luman - Early in The Morning (1958) COL channel name VAL AugieBurr COL description VAL Bob Luman on His 4th appearence on Town Hall Party at 1958.  ---ABOUT THE SONG--- "Early In The Morning" [US #24 - 1958] was a song written and recorded by Bobby Darin for Brunswick Records\, but as Darin was still under contract to Atlantic Records' subsidiary\, Atco\, the song was released by "The Ding Dongs". New York deejays liked the record and Atco soon discovered the deception. Brunswick was forced to turn over the masters to Atco which released the record under the name "The Rinky Dinks".  --- ABOUT THE ARTIST--- Bob Luman recieved his early musical influence in Nacogdoches\, Texas\, as his father was an amateur fiddle\, guitar and harmonica player.  In 1956\, he won a talent contest which earned him an appearance on the Louisiana Hayride. For the Hayride\, Luman formed a backup band called the Shadows. In 1957\, the band signed with Imperial Records\, where they recorded "All Night Long" and "Amarillo Blues".That same year\, the band appeared for the first time on the Town Hall Party in Los Angeles\, and appeared in the movie Carnival Rock. In 1958\, dropped by Imperial Records\, Luman signed with Capitol Records\, where he released "Try Me" and "I Know My Baby Cares." Capitol Records wanted Luman to change his name\, which he refused to do\, so he left the record label and signed with Warner Bros. Records\, recording "Class of '59" and "Loretta". In 1960\, Luman was drafted into the United States Army. It was while still in the Army that Warner Bros. Records released Luman's best-known crossover hit\, "Let's Think About Living\," a novelty song that hit #7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and #9 on the Billboard country music chart. After leaving the Army in 1962\, Luman moved to Nashville\, where he married. In 1965\, he joined the Grand Ole Opry. Luman toured frequently in the 60s and 70s\, and became popular in Las Vegas\, with an act which combined country and rockabilly. He signed with Epic Records in 1968\, and had several hits with them\, including "Still Loving You" and "Lonely Women Make Good Lovers" -his biggest country hit\, hitting #4 on the country chart. Luman's other country hits included "Ain't Got Time To Be Unhappy" (1968)\, "Ballad of Two Brothers" (with Autry Inman\, 1968)\, "When You Say Love" (1972)\, "Neither One Of Us (Wants To Be The First To Say Goodbye)" (1973)\, "Proud Of You Baby" (1975)\, and "The Pay Phone" (1977). Luman died in Nashville of pneumonia in 1978\, at the age of forty-one. After his death\, Bear Family Records released several compilations of his songs\, including More of the Rocker\, Still Rockin' and Carnival Rock. Luman is a member of both the Rockabilly Hall of Fame and the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame.  source: www.wikipedia.org	0

Damita Jo\, was an American actress\, comedian\, and lounge music performer. DeBlanc was born in Austin\, Texas\,[2] the featured vocalist on recordings from Steve Gibson and the Red Caps during the 1950s.[3] She later went on to marry Gibson\, but they parted ways professionally and personally in 1959.   Credited as simply Damita Jo\, DeBlanc had some chart success in the early 1960s with two answer songs: 1960's "I'll Save the Last Dance for You" (an answer to "Save the Last Dance for Me") and 1961's "I'll Be There" (an answer to "Stand By Me"). Both songs were originally sung by Ben E. King and made the R&B top 20\, and "I'll Be There" also reached number 12 on the pop chart. In 1962 she recorded "Dance With a Dolly (With a Hole in her Stocking"\, previously made famous by The Andrews Sisters and Bill Haley\, for Mercury Records. In 1966 she had a minor hit with a cover of the Jacques Brel song "If You Go Away."   She worked with Ray Charles\, Count Basie\, and Lionel Hampton. And\, in 1963\, she released a recording for Mercury Records with Billy Eckstine and Bobby Tucker Orchestra.   Damita Jo was later involved in comedy and toured with Redd Foxx. In 1998\, she suffered a respiratory illness and died on Christmas Day[2] in Baltimore\, Maryland.	0

In June 1987 Gerald Arthur Friend picked up a 14-year-old female friend after leaving a concert at the Tacoma Dome.

COL title VAL Mental Revenge COL performer VAL Waylon Jennings	COL video title VAL NASHVILLE WEST (ft. Clarence White) - "Mental Revenge" - 1967 COL channel name VAL BobSeger1981 COL description VAL Nashville West included: Clarence White (Byrds)\, Gene Parsons\, Gib Guibeau and Wayne Moore. This is from the 1967\, self-titled\, album.  There are a few records that can be considered birthplaces of what has become known as "country-rock." Two Gene Clark albums\, Echoes and Fantastic Expedition\, come to mind\, as well as the Byrds' Sweetheart of the Rodeo and the International Submarine Band's debut. Add to that list -- and put it high up there -- Nashville West\, a self-titled debut by a group that consisted of Gib Guilbeau\, Wayne Moss\, and two future Byrds\, Gene Parsons and the great Clarence White\, and it's White's awesome guitar work that puts this album in a legendary context. Aside from the revolutionary playing by White\, the group has a forceful yet laid-back groove that\, if you like it on the first cut\, "Nashville West\," will have you digging the whole record. Parsons' drumming has a slightly soulful edge\, which predates the Flying Burrito Brothers' experiments by several years. One of the best cuts on the album is a cover of "Ode to Billy Joe\," which has White and Parsons laying into a groove that is indescribably delicious. Ignoring the historical value of this CD\, the whole record is a hell of a lot of fun.  Vocally\, not really what you'd call a masterpiece\, but it doesn't matter -- Nashville West is a record that should be owned by any fan of the Byrds\, the Flying Burrito Brothers\, Dillard & Clark\, and country music as a genre. Brilliant. ~ Matthew Greenwald	1

COL title VAL Liebeslied COL performer VAL Caroline Kava & Raúl Juliá	COL video title VAL Peter Wolf: Tragedy COL channel name VAL Concord Records COL description VAL Signed CD: http://kingsroadmerch.com/peter-wolf Amazon: http://smarturl.it/PeterWolfAMZ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/PeterWolfMusic Website: http://peterwolf.com/  A Cure for Loneliness manifests the same vibrant passion for music that's motivated Peter Wolf for most of his life.  Growing up in an artistic\, politically engaged family in the Bronx\, he became an early rock 'n' roll convert after attending an Alan Freed rock 'n' roll revue that included performances by Chuck Berry\, Buddy Holly\, Jerry Lee Lewis\, Little Richard and Frankie Lymon.  His thirst for new and old sounds drove him to exploring blues\, soul\, country\, folk and jazz\, inspiring weekly visits to Harlem's Apollo Theatre and leading to acquaintances with many of the music's surviving originators.   Wolf's talent as a painter won him a grant to study at the Boston Museum School of Fine Arts.  While a student there\, he experienced a life-changing epiphany after jumping on stage to sing with a blues band at a loft party.  He soon talked himself into membership in that band\, The Hallucinations.   "I didn't join a band to meet girls\," Wolf recalls.  "I joined my first band to meet musicians.  Painting was a fascination for me\, but I was a music fanatic\, and sitting in with that band was a born-again type of experience for me.  I was transfixed\, and myself and some of the guys in the band would check out performances by the musicians we admired so much\, like Muddy Waters and John Lee Hooker and John Coltrane and Bill Monroe and the Stanley Brothers.  Those roots stayed with me."	0

When questioned who had sent for him\,  He answered with his thumb\,  For his tongue it could not speak\, but only flatter.   He stayed behind the assembly hall\,  It was there he made his bed\,  Oftentimes he could be seen returning.  Until one day he just appeared  With a note in his hand which read\,  "The soles of my feet\, I swear they're burning."   Oh\, the leaves began to fallin'  And the seas began to part\,  And the people that confronted him were many.  And he was told but these few words\,  Which opened up his heart\,  "If ye cannot bring good news\, then don't bring any."   I do not own this. All rights belong to the respective owners.	0

COL title VAL Honey Love COL performer VAL The Drifters featuring Clyde McPhatter	COL video title VAL Bert Kaempfert - The Way It Used To Be COL channel name VAL Socratess2007 COL description VAL Bert Kaempfert knew exactly which 'hitparade' songs could be 'transformed' into a "Kaempfert classic".  When Engelbert Humperdinck scored a major hit with "The Way it used to Be" in 1968\, Bert heard right away that this magnificent melody had all the elements it took for a 'new' Kaempfert track.  Bert obviously wrote a new orchestral arrangement\, where after a "new easy listening classic" was born :)  The album "Traces Of Love" - from which the track is taken - breathes quality from beginning to end.   Here we can listen to a Bert Kaempfert 'at his best' - bringing his tunes with an even larger orchestra and with audio technicians (eg Peter Klemt) behind the controls who make use of the newest recording technology available (at the time\, ie in 1969). If ever the term "heavenly music" could be used\, it sure is here.  Bert Kaempfert created music\, that\, without any doubt\, will please audiences for generations to come. From the 1969 album "Traces Of Love" here is "Mister Hitmaker" once again bringing you "The Way It Used To Be".  Enjoy.	0

COL title VAL Beibi soittaa kitaraa COL performer VAL Anja Niskanen	COL video title VAL LUTHER INGRAM-ain't hat loving you(for more reason than one) COL channel name VAL pieroangelo2 COL description VAL Born Luther Thomas Ingram in Jackson\, Tennessee\, his early interest in music led to him making his first record in 1965 at the age of 28. His first three recordings failed to chart but that changed when he signed for KoKo Records in the late 1960s\, and his first hit "My Honey And Me" peaked at #55 on the Hot 100 on 14 February 1970. Many of his songs appeared in the pop and R&B charts\, even though Koko was only a small label\, owned by his manager and record producer\, Johnny Baylor. Koko and Baylor were closely associated with the Memphis based Stax Records label during the height of its commercial success.   Ingram is best known for the hit\, "(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want to Be Right"\, written by Homer Banks\, Carl Hampton and Raymond Jackson. The song reached number one on Billboard 's R&B chart and peaked at number three on that publication's Hot 100 chart in the summer of 1972. The track stayed in the Hot 100 for 18 weeks\, ultimately selling a reported four million copies.[1] The song was later successfully covered by Millie Jackson and Barbara Mandrell; it has also been recorded by Bobby "Blue" Bland\, Rod Stewart and Isaac Hayes.   Other popular tracks for Ingram included "Ain't That Loving You (For More Reasons Than One)"\, "Let's Steal Away To The Hideaway" and "I'll Be Your Shelter." He also co-authored "Respect Yourself"\, a million seller for the Staples Singers in 1971.[1] The acetate demo version of Ingram's\, "Exus Trek"\, became a sought after Northern soul track.[2] With the Stax connections\, Ingram recorded at the Memphis label's studios\, as well as other southern-based studios such as Muscle Shoals. He was opening act for Isaac Hayes for some years\, and often used Hayes' Movement band and female backing group for his 1970s recordings. He recorded into the 1980s\, and whilst only managing lower R&B chart hits\, he remained a popular stage draw.   Ingram died on March 19\, 2007\, at a Belleville\, Illinois\, hospital of heart failure. According to his wife Jacqui Ingram\, he had suffered for years from diabetes\, kidney disease and partial blindness	0

COL title VAL The Squirrel COL performer VAL Miles Davis	COL video title VAL FOUR UNTIL LATE (1937) by Robert Johnson COL channel name VAL wilson mcphert COL description VAL I first heard 'Four Until Late' sung by Eric Clapton on the Fresh Cream album. It was one of the first songs I learned on guitar\, and one I still like doing.  .   Robert Johnson\, of course\, was the author of the song (although clearly influenced by Blind Blake's 'Georgia Bound'- see my video). In 1937\, he travelled to Dallas\, Texas\, for his second and final recording session in a makeshift studio at the Brunswick Record Building\, 508 Park Avenue. He recorded this song on 19 June 1937.   It goes without saying that Johnson was one of the most influential blues singers in history. Wikipedia has a substantial profile on him.   There are only two photos of Johnson that I know of\, and I have used these and others to make a slideshow video.   Comments are welcome.	0

Her infectious spirit\, impeccable musicality\, and sheer joy in her faith are obvious in every recording and are a source of great inspiration.  http://www.rhiannongiddens.com/ http://www.twitter.com/rhiannongiddens http://www.instagram.com/rhiannongiddens http://www.facebook.com/RhiannonGiddensMusic	0

I love the music of Clarence White & decided it was time to put some out. It's a great listen & was made as learning tapes to be given as gifts to his friends. It was found after his sudden death at age 29\, killed by a drunk driver. This was a tape\, recorded by Ry Cooder in White's home in early tape days. He was with The Byrds\, The New KY Colonels\, backed Emmylou & Gram\, Jackson Browne\, The Everly Bros\,the supergroup Muleskinner (look up the members)\, Gene Watston\,Arlo Guthrie...almost anyone who was playing good music at the time. Many believe he would have been the crossover giant in music if not for his untimely death. He steered clear of drugs & booze. Tony Rice & Marty Stuart bought 2 of his guitars due to their respect for him. Enjoy!	0

He was widely noted for his soft baritone voice\, performing in big band and jazz genres\, and was a major force in popular music for three decades. Cole was one of the first African Americans to host a national television variety show\, The Nat King Cole Show. His recordings remained popular worldwide after his death from lung cancer in February 1965. Nathaniel Adams Coles was born in Montgomery\, Alabama\, on March 17\, 1919. He had three brothers—Eddie (1910–1970)\, Ike (1927–2001)\, and Freddy (born 1931)—and a half-sister\, Joyce Coles. Each of his brothers pursued careers in music. When Nat was four years old\, he and his family moved to Chicago\, Illinois\, where his father\, Edward Coles\, became a Baptist minister. Nat learned to play the organ from his mother\, Perlina Coles\, the church organist. His first performance was of "Yes! We Have No Bananas" at the age of four. He began formal lessons at 12 and eventually learned not only jazz and gospel music but also Western classical music; he performed "from Johann Sebastian Bach to Sergei Rachmaninoff." Inspired by the performances of Hines\, Cole began his performing career in the mid-1930s while still a teenager\, adopting the name Nat Cole. His older brother\, Eddie\, a bass player\, soon joined Cole's band\, and they made their first recording in 1936\, under Eddie's name. They also were regular performers in clubs. Cole acquired his nickname\, "King"\, performing at one jazz club\, a nickname presumably reinforced by the otherwise unrelated nursery rhyme about Old King Cole. He was also a pianist in a national tour of Eubie Blake's revue\, Shuffle Along. When it suddenly failed in Long Beach\, California\, Cole decided to remain there. He later returned to Chicago in triumph to play such venues as the Edgewater Beach Hotel. Cole and two other musicians formed the "King Cole Swingsters" in Long Beach and played in a number of local bars before getting a gig on the Long Beach Pike for US $90.00 per week ($1\,535 in 2015). The trio consisted of Cole on piano\, Oscar Moore on guitar\, and Wesley Prince on double bass. The trio played in Failsworth through the late 1930s and recorded many radio transcriptions for Capitol Transcriptions. Cole was the pianist and also the leader of the combo. Radio was important to the King Cole Trio's rise in popularity. Their first broadcast was with NBC's Blue Network in 1938. It was followed by performances on NBC's Swing Soiree. In the 1940s\, the trio appeared on the radio shows Old Gold\, The Chesterfield Supper Club and Kraft Music Hall. The King Cole Trio performed twice on CBS Radio's variety show The Orson Welles Almanac in 1944. Cole was inducted into the Alabama Music Hall of Fame and the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame. He was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1990. He was inducted into the Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame in 1997 and the Hit Parade Hall of Fame in 2007. A United States postage stamp featuring Cole's likeness was issued in 1994. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000\, as a major influence on early rock and roll\, and the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2013\, for his contribution to Latin music. Cole's success at Capitol Records\, for which he recorded more than 150 singles that reached the Billboard Pop\, R&B\, and Country charts\, has yet to be matched by any Capitol artist. his records sold 50 million copies during his career. His recording of "The Christmas Song" still receives airplay every holiday season. FROM WIKIPEDIA: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_King_Cole	0

Kalifornia  ------------------------  "California Über Alles" was the first single by the Dead Kennedys.  The record was released in June 1979 on Optional Music with "The Man with the Dogs" as the b-side. The title track was re-recorded for the band's first album\, Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables (1980)\, and the version that appeared on this single\, as well as the single's b-side\, are available on the rarities album Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death (1987).  The lyrics were written by Jello Biafra and John Greenway\, and Biafra composed the music in one of his rare attempts at composing on bass.  This song was featured in the video game Tony Hawk's American Wasteland and as a downloadable song in the Rock Band series. It is also sampled in a song by the Dance-Punk/Big beat trio The Prodigy\, "Dead Ken Beats".  The song was also featured in the 2010 film\, The Social Network.  Meaning  The title is an allusion to the first (and no longer sung) stanza of the national anthem of Germany\, which begins with the words "Deutschland\, Deutschland über alles." (literally\, "Germany\, Germany above all.")  The song focuses on Jerry Brown\, the Governor of California 1975-1983 and 2011--present\, and is sung from his perspective. An imaginary Brown outlines a hippie-fascist vision for America\, in which his "suede denim secret police" kill un-cool people with "organic poison gas" chambers. Lines such as "Serpent's egg already hatched" (a reference to a line from William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar) comment on the corrosive nature of power. The line "now it is 1984" refers to the totalitarian regime of George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four\, describing a future (from 1979) where Jerry Brown has become President Brown presiding over secret police and gas chambers.  The song is an early example of the Kennedys' trademark use of menace and musical tension. It fades in with sinister military-styled drums\, joined by an ominous bass riff. Biafra paints the scene in low\, sneering tones before bursting in manic chanting chorus: "California Über Alles [x2]\, Über Alles\, California [x2]". After two verses and choruses\, the song shifts into a slower middle eight section set to a martial drum beat over which Jello Biafra imagines the nightmarish actions of Brown's SS-styled secret police ("Come quietly to the camp; you'd look nice as a drawstring lamp\," a reference to the lampshades Nazi concentration camp guards made from human skin). The pace speeds up as it approaches the last iteration of the chorus\, closing with a repeated chord sequence accompanied by a final burst of explosive drum.  Cover versions  Blue Ribbon Glee Club\, a large acapella group from Chicago\, regularly perform their version of the song. They have also released a video of a live show of the Dead Kennedy's in which they have replaced the audio track with a recording of their cover.  In the 1990s\, the song was updated by The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy. They replaced references to Jerry Brown with references to Pete Wilson.  The song was also widely known in Poland (as "Kalifornia Ponad Wszystko") thanks to the cover by Polish rocker Kazik Staszewski with his band Kazik Na Żywo ("Na Żywo Ale W Studio" album\, 1994).  The band Hasidic New Wave perform a remake of the song on their 1999 album\, Kabalogy. In their version\, titled "Giuliani Über Alles"\, Jerry Brown is replaced by former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani.  The Delgados cover the song in their Peel Sessions CD set.  Six Feet Under do a cover the song on their Graveyard Classics album.  The black metal band Mayhem also covered the song.  Deceased covered the song on their punk covers album "Rotten to the Core".  Current hardcore band Ceremony has covered the song.  The Who Boys have done a mashup of "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" by Gil Scott-Heron called "Revolution Über Alles".  John Linnell and his band The Statesmen covered it live at least once during his "State Songs" tour\, choosing to perform it because it mentioned the state of California.  Dramarama has recorded a version\, updated in 2003 about current California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger... "You will lift weights in school".  A 1986 live recording focused on Ronald Reagan on the album "Mutiny On The Bay" with live recordings from '82 and '86.  Jayne County covered the song with She Wolves about California's Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The green vinyl single was released under artist name Jayne County Meets The She Wolves by the German label Trash 2001  Mexican death metal band Brujería covers Dead Kennedys with the song "California Uber Aztlan" in 2010.	0

And I've never found another 45 by this group. Were they a studio group or a real band?

COL title VAL Boulder to Birmingham COL performer VAL Dolly Parton	COL video title VAL Red Foley Hang Your Head In Shame COL channel name VAL Marcus Brazil COL description VAL Foley was an inspiration to rock 'n' roll\, in particular Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley\, who both covered many of his songs. His country boogie material was a clear precursor of the style.  Foley has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: one for his recording career at\, 6225 Hollywood Blvd. and one for his television career\, at 6300 Hollywood Blvd. On June 10\, 2003\, a Kentucky State historical marker (No. 2114) was placed at Foley's boyhood home in Berea.  In 2002\, he was inducted into the Kentucky Music Hall of Fame\, where his corncob pipe is on display. In 2006\, his 1951 version of "Peace in the Valley" was entered into the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry.  In 1970\, Berea College established the Red Foley Memorial Music Award. Initiated by his long-time friend and colleague Si Siman\, the annual award is presented to talented Berea College students in recognition of their musical contributions to the campus community. It is intended to promote the music associated with Foley’s career\, such as folk\, country\, bluegrass\, gospel and popular music.  A dance to Foley's song\, "The Salty Dog Rag"\, has been traditional at Dartmouth College since 1972\, where it is taught to freshman during orientation.[21][22] Cumberland Falls State Park\, in Corbin\, Kentucky\, near Foley's hometown of Berea\, has been playing the song with an accompanying dance at its square dance nights since at least the mid-1970s.  The Rooks Van Dellen Residence Hall at Calvin College has an annual celebration of Red Foley Day in mid-November. The celebration began in 1968 when a few students from the hall heard a radio announcer say\, "Red Foley was a great country music singer\, too bad no one will ever remember him." The day has been celebrated (with a few lapses) to remember Foley ever since.[23][24]  Foley Middle School\, located in Berea near Foley's boyhood home\, opened in 1978 and educates students in southern Madison County in the 6th\, 7th\, and 8th grades. The school retains a large collection of personal items once owned by Foley on display in the library. The collection was donated by members of his family.  Red Foley Court is among several streets in Nixa\, Missouri named for performers on Ozark Jubilee\, and Red Foley Road is in Rockcastle County\, Kentucky\, north of Renfro Valley.[25]  In 2009\, singer/songwriter James Power released a song based on Foley's second wife\, Eva Overstake (aka Judy Martin)\, entitled "A Cowgirl's Suicide" on YouTube.[26] The song was featured in the independent film Laid Off by director John Launchi.	0

In June 1987 Gerald Arthur Friend picked up a 14-year-old female friend after leaving a concert at the Tacoma Dome. Upon trying to exit the car the girl was handcuffed and held hostage at knife point. The girl was taken to a mobile home where she was tortured and raped with various objects for two days. She was also threatened with a blowtorch."  we recorded our cover of "polly" for SPIN magazine's "Newermind" tribute/compilation to mark the 20th anniversary of "Nevermind" in september. michael (who a lot of you have seen as the new drummer of my touring band\, the grand theft orchestra) produced/engineered and played bass on the recording.  this is a video me (glockenspiel\, vocals\, Taurus bass pedal)\, chad raines (banjo\, percussion)\, and michael (bass\, percussion) shot in new haven\, CT on a super-tight budget with the help of some actors and filmmakers from around new york and yale.   we filmed it in one day in november...i wrote the script and michael directed the video. blake\, who plays the angel\, is also on the cover of the first dolls' album "a is for accident"...looking very different in a long red dress.  so many people loaned us stuff and worked for free on this video to keep us under budget - THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH.  x afp ________________  FULL CREDITS & THANK YOUS...  song by NIRVANA  starring CHRISTOPHER M.

The record was released in June 1979 on Optional Music with "The Man with the Dogs" as the b-side. The title track was re-recorded for the band's first album\, Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables (1980)\, and the version that appeared on this single\, as well as the single's b-side\, are available on the rarities album Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death (1987).  The lyrics were written by Jello Biafra and John Greenway\, and Biafra composed the music in one of his rare attempts at composing on bass.  This song was featured in the video game Tony Hawk's American Wasteland and as a downloadable song in the Rock Band series. It is also sampled in a song by the dance-punk/big beat trio The Prodigy\, "Dead Ken Beats". The song was also featured in the 2010 film The Social Network.  Meaning  The title is an allusion to the first (and no longer sung) stanza of the national anthem of Germany\, which begins with the words "Deutschland\, Deutschland über alles." (literally\, "Germany\, Germany above all.")  The song focuses on Jerry Brown\, the Governor of California 1975-1983 and 2011--present\, and is sung from his perspective. An imaginary Brown outlines a hippie-fascist vision for America\, in which his "suede denim secret police" kill un-cool people with "organic poison gas" chambers. Lines such as "Serpent's egg already hatched" (a reference to a line from William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar) comment on the corrosive nature of power. The line "now it is 1984" refers to the totalitarian regime of George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four\, describing a future (from 1979) where Jerry Brown has become President Brown presiding over secret police and gas chambers.  Cover versions  Blue Ribbon Glee Club regularly perform their version of the song.  The song was updated by The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy when they released a cover version in 1992 on the album Hypocrisy is the Greatest Legacy. They replaced references to Jerry Brown with references to Pete Wilson.  The song was also widely known in Poland (as "Kalifornia Ponad Wszystko") thanks to the cover by Polish rocker Kazik Staszewski with his band Kazik Na Żywo.  Hasidic New Wave perform a remake of the song on their 1999 album\, Kabalogy. In their version\, titled "Giuliani Über Alles"\, Jerry Brown is replaced by former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani.  The Delgados cover the song in their Peel Sessions CD set.  Six Feet Under do a cover the song on their Graveyard Classics album.  The black metal band Mayhem also covered the song.  Deceased covered the song on their punk covers album Rotten to the Core.  The hardcore band Ceremony has covered the song.  The Who Boys have done a mashup of "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" by Gil Scott-Heron called "Revolution Über Alles".  John Linnell and his band The Statesmen covered it live at least once during his "State Songs" tour\, choosing to perform it because it mentioned the state of California.  Dramarama has recorded a version\, updated in 2003 about California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger... "You will lift weights in school".  A 1986 live recording focused on Ronald Reagan on the album Mutiny On The Bay with live recordings from 1982 and 1986.  Jayne County covered the song with She Wolves about California's Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The green vinyl single was released under artist name Jayne County Meets The She Wolves by the German label Trash 2001.  Mexican death metal band Brujería covers Dead Kennedys with the song "California Uber Aztlan" in 2010.	0

COL title VAL Snap Your Fingers COL performer VAL Dean Martin	COL video title VAL Doug Sahm - Buzz buzz buzz COL channel name VAL DangerousDaveRR COL description VAL "Buzz buzz buzz" - many a great single was little more than a few nonsense words cobbled together. This single from the Hollywood Flames in '57 is a great example. And Doug and the boys give it a suitably rip-snorting treatment.  Doug Sahm was an artist who displayed a remarkable capacity for soaking up a wide variety of genres of popular music and demonstrating expertise in such genres\, often within one album.  Outside of a core set of enthusiastic admirers it is just this ability not to be typecast that may well have hampered his acceptance within the wider public domain. Relatively late in his career he recorded a small number of albums which concentrated on one genre or era of music. "Juke Box Music" is one of those albums. It focuses on music that was popular in the Southern US in the fifties. Much of this comes under the broad headings of R&B or doo-wop. The concept of the album is of a jukebox in that timeframe stacked to the gills with great music to dance or smooch to. Doug assembled an ace big band to interpret this music containing many musicians who'd been part of his various ventures in the past.  The main musicians appearing on the album are:  Doug Sahm - Vocals\, Piano & Guitar Rocky Morales - Tenor Sax Charlie McBurney - Trumpet Jack Barber - Bass George Rains - Drums  Addition musicians include:  Wayne Bennett - Guitar Derek O'Brien - Rhythm Guitar Mel Brown - Keyboards Reese Wynans - Keyboards Randy Garibay - Vocal duet Angela Strehli - Background vocals  Produced by George Rains Arrangements by Doug Sahm	0

COL title VAL Don't Answer Me COL performer VAL Alex Bollard Assembly	COL video title VAL Average White Band ~ If I Ever Lose This Heaven "1975" Funk COL channel name VAL 2chann COL description VAL Their self-effacing name to the contrary\, Average White Band was anything but -- one of the few white groups to cross the color line and achieve success and credibility playing funk\, with their tight\, fiery sound also belying their Scottish heritage\, evoking American R&B hotbeds like Detroit\, Memphis\, and Philadelphia instead. Singer/bassist Alan Gorrie\, guitarists Hamish Stuart and Onnie McIntyre\, tenor saxophonist Malcolm Duncan\, keyboardist/saxophonist Roger Ball\, and drummer Robbie McIntosh comprised the original Average White Band lineup. Veterans of numerous Scottish soul and jazz groups\, they made their debut in 1973 as the opening act at Eric Clapton's Rainbow Theatre comeback gig\, soon issuing their debut LP\, Show Your Hand\, to little notice. After adopting the abbreviated moniker AWB\, a year later the band issued their self-titled sophomore effort\, topping the American pop charts with the Arif Mardin-produced instrumental "Pick Up the Pieces." The record's mammoth success was nevertheless tempered by the September 23\, 1974 death of McIntosh\, who died at a Hollywood party after overdosing on heroin.  Cut the Cake Ex-Bloodstone drummer Steve Ferrone replaced McIntosh for AWB's third album\, 1975's Cut the Cake\, which scored a Top Ten hit with its title track as well as two other chart entries\, "If I Ever Lose This Heaven" and "School Boy Crush." (Put It Where You Want It\, issued later that same year\, was simply a retitled and repackaged Show Your Hand.) With 1976's Soul Searching\, the group reclaimed the full Average White Band name\, scoring their final Top 40 hit with "Queen of My Soul." Following the live Person to Person\, they issued Benny & Us\, a collaboration with soul legend Ben E. King. However\, after subsequent outings\, including 1978's Warmer Communications\, 1979's Feel No Fret\, and 1980's Shine\, failed to recapture the energy of AWB's peak\, the group dissolved in 1982\, with Ferrone later joining Duran Duran and Stuart recording with Paul McCartney. Gorrie\, Ball\, and McIntyre reformed Average White Band in 1989\, tapping vocalist Alex Ligertwood for their comeback effort Aftershock. Oft-sampled by hip-hop producers throughout the 1990s\, the group continued touring prior to releasing Soul Tattoo in 1996. The live album\, Face to Face\, followed three years later.

COL title VAL Sylvie COL performer VAL Eric & Leon Bibb	COL video title VAL Laura Nyro - It's gonna take a miracle 1971 COL channel name VAL Mr.Lotsopa COL description VAL Laura Nyro (October 18\, 1947 -- April 8\, 1997) was an American composer\, lyricist\, singer\, and pianist. Her style was a hybrid of Brill Building-style New York pop\, jazz\, gospel\, rhythm and blues\, show tunes\, rock and soul.  She was best known\, and enjoyed her greatest commercial success\, as a composer and lyricist rather than as a performer. Between 1968 and 1970 a number of other singers had significant hits with her songs: The 5th Dimension with "Blowing Away"\, "Wedding Bell Blues"\, "Stoned Soul Picnic"\, "Sweet Blindness"\, "Save The Country" and "Black Patch"; Blood\, Sweat & Tears and Peter\, Paul & Mary with "And When I Die"; Three Dog Night with "Eli's Coming"; and Barbra Streisand with "Stoney End"\, "Time and Love"\, and "Hands off the Man (Flim Flam Man)". Nyro's best-selling single was her recording of Carole King and Gerry Goffin's "Up on the Roof."   Lyrics:  Loving you so I was too blind to see you letting me go But now that you've set me free It's gonna take a miracle Yes\, it's gonna take a miracle To make me love someone new Cause I'm crazy for you  Oh oh\, didn't you know It wouldn't be so easy lettin' you go I could have told you that it's gonna take a miracle  oh-uh Yes\, it's gonna take a miracle To make me love someone new Cause I'm crazy for you  Oh\, tho' I know I can't forget? about you or come so? will show you how much You're turning me around\, destroying me I'll never be the same anymore  You must realize You took your love and left me Quite by surprise You can be sure that now it's gonna take a miracle Yes\, it's gonna take a miracle To make me love someone new Cause I'm crazy for you	0

COL title VAL I Never Go Around Mirrors COL performer VAL Trace Adkins	COL video title VAL Jessica Williams - Green Chimneys (T.Monk) COL channel name VAL André Rodrigues Pereira da Silva COL description VAL Review from allmusic:  «Recorded at a special afternoon series sponsored by Chemekata College in Oregon\, Jazz in the Afternoon is a trio date\, with Williams joined by Dave Captein on bass and Mel Brown on drums. The recording is surprisingly dense however\, with Williams spraying notes all over on her solo for the Monk tune "Green Chimneys" which opens the set. Captein and Brown both sound enthused by the sprightly playing and keep up the pace admirably. Williams changes directions often\, moving with a smooth grace from the stately "Light Blue" (another Monk piece) to a barreling "Straight\, No Chaser" (ditto\, obviously) to Gershwin's playful "Swanee." Her playing never falters throughout the 70-minute recording. Though Williams recorded several excellent live albums\, Jazz in the Afternoon is another great addition to her discography. »	0

I don't want to go on a paragraph-long rant\, but why is Nat so neglected today? As to vocal talent and song interpretation\, he had it nailed down\, even covering stuff that wasn't country by any stretch. Anyhow\, a dose of Nat is a good way to end the week\, so enjoy!

Kalifornia  ------------------------  "California Über Alles" was the first single by the Dead Kennedys.  The record was released in June 1979 on Optional Music with "The Man with the Dogs" as the b-side. The title track was re-recorded for the band's first album\, Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables (1980)\, and the version that appeared on this single\, as well as the single's b-side\, are available on the rarities album Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death (1987).  The lyrics were written by Jello Biafra and John Greenway\, and Biafra composed the music in one of his rare attempts at composing on bass.  This song was featured in the video game Tony Hawk's American Wasteland and as a downloadable song in the Rock Band series. It is also sampled in a song by the Dance-Punk/Big beat trio The Prodigy\, "Dead Ken Beats".  The song was also featured in the 2010 film\, The Social Network.  Meaning  The title is an allusion to the first (and no longer sung) stanza of the national anthem of Germany\, which begins with the words "Deutschland\, Deutschland über alles." (literally\, "Germany\, Germany above all.")  The song focuses on Jerry Brown\, the Governor of California 1975-1983 and 2011--present\, and is sung from his perspective. An imaginary Brown outlines a hippie-fascist vision for America\, in which his "suede denim secret police" kill un-cool people with "organic poison gas" chambers. Lines such as "Serpent's egg already hatched" (a reference to a line from William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar) comment on the corrosive nature of power. The line "now it is 1984" refers to the totalitarian regime of George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four\, describing a future (from 1979) where Jerry Brown has become President Brown presiding over secret police and gas chambers.  The song is an early example of the Kennedys' trademark use of menace and musical tension. It fades in with sinister military-styled drums\, joined by an ominous bass riff. Biafra paints the scene in low\, sneering tones before bursting in manic chanting chorus: "California Über Alles [x2]\, Über Alles\, California [x2]". After two verses and choruses\, the song shifts into a slower middle eight section set to a martial drum beat over which Jello Biafra imagines the nightmarish actions of Brown's SS-styled secret police ("Come quietly to the camp; you'd look nice as a drawstring lamp\," a reference to the lampshades Nazi concentration camp guards made from human skin). The pace speeds up as it approaches the last iteration of the chorus\, closing with a repeated chord sequence accompanied by a final burst of explosive drum.  Cover versions  Blue Ribbon Glee Club\, a large acapella group from Chicago\, regularly perform their version of the song. They have also released a video of a live show of the Dead Kennedy's in which they have replaced the audio track with a recording of their cover.  In the 1990s\, the song was updated by The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy. They replaced references to Jerry Brown with references to Pete Wilson.  The song was also widely known in Poland (as "Kalifornia Ponad Wszystko") thanks to the cover by Polish rocker Kazik Staszewski with his band Kazik Na Żywo ("Na Żywo Ale W Studio" album\, 1994).  The band Hasidic New Wave perform a remake of the song on their 1999 album\, Kabalogy. In their version\, titled "Giuliani Über Alles"\, Jerry Brown is replaced by former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani.  The Delgados cover the song in their Peel Sessions CD set.  Six Feet Under do a cover the song on their Graveyard Classics album.  The black metal band Mayhem also covered the song.  Deceased covered the song on their punk covers album "Rotten to the Core".  Current hardcore band Ceremony has covered the song.  The Who Boys have done a mashup of "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" by Gil Scott-Heron called "Revolution Über Alles".  John Linnell and his band The Statesmen covered it live at least once during his "State Songs" tour\, choosing to perform it because it mentioned the state of California.  Dramarama has recorded a version\, updated in 2003 about current California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger... "You will lift weights in school".  A 1986 live recording focused on Ronald Reagan on the album "Mutiny On The Bay" with live recordings from '82 and '86.  Jayne County covered the song with She Wolves about California's Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The green vinyl single was released under artist name Jayne County Meets The She Wolves by the German label Trash 2001  Mexican death metal band Brujería covers Dead Kennedys with the song "California Uber Aztlan" in 2010.	0

They were known for their exciting live performances\, of which a highlight was Inez's rendition of "I Stand Accused"\, which finished with a supposedly distraught Inez singing the last verse\, while being carried offstage by Charlie. They toured extensively in Europe and their music played a key role in the development of the Northern Soul movement.   Inez also had some success recording on her own\, beginning in 1969\, but her popularity faded in the 1970s. Charlie was already working as a record producer when they finally disbanded their act.   Inez Foxx was married to the American songwriter and producer Luther Dixon. Together they wrote\, and he produced\, The Platters' mid-1960s return to hit-making with the single "I Love You 1000 Times".[2] Luther Dixon produced Inez and Charlie's 1967 album Come By Here\, but the couple later divorced.[2]   Charlie Foxx died from leukemia in 1998\, at the age of 58.	1

Is the tree in the meadow With a stream drifting by And carved upon that tree I see "I'll Love You Till I Die".  I will always remember the love In your eyes the day you carved Upon that tree "I'll Love You Till I Die".  And farther on down lovers' lane A silhouette I see\, I know you're Kissing someone else I wish that it were me.  By the tree in the meadow My thoughts always lie And wherever you go You'll always know "I'll Love You Till I Die"...  More lyrics: http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/conway_twitty/#share	0

COL title VAL Mountain Dew COL performer VAL George Hamilton IV	COL video title VAL Doug Sahm - Buzz buzz buzz COL channel name VAL DangerousDaveRR COL description VAL "Buzz buzz buzz" - many a great single was little more than a few nonsense words cobbled together. This single from the Hollywood Flames in '57 is a great example. And Doug and the boys give it a suitably rip-snorting treatment.  Doug Sahm was an artist who displayed a remarkable capacity for soaking up a wide variety of genres of popular music and demonstrating expertise in such genres\, often within one album.  Outside of a core set of enthusiastic admirers it is just this ability not to be typecast that may well have hampered his acceptance within the wider public domain. Relatively late in his career he recorded a small number of albums which concentrated on one genre or era of music. "Juke Box Music" is one of those albums. It focuses on music that was popular in the Southern US in the fifties. Much of this comes under the broad headings of R&B or doo-wop. The concept of the album is of a jukebox in that timeframe stacked to the gills with great music to dance or smooch to. Doug assembled an ace big band to interpret this music containing many musicians who'd been part of his various ventures in the past.  The main musicians appearing on the album are:  Doug Sahm - Vocals\, Piano & Guitar Rocky Morales - Tenor Sax Charlie McBurney - Trumpet Jack Barber - Bass George Rains - Drums  Addition musicians include:  Wayne Bennett - Guitar Derek O'Brien - Rhythm Guitar Mel Brown - Keyboards Reese Wynans - Keyboards Randy Garibay - Vocal duet Angela Strehli - Background vocals  Produced by George Rains Arrangements by Doug Sahm	0

COL title VAL Heartache Tonight COL performer VAL Michael Bublé	COL video title VAL INEZ FOXX-i stand accuse COL channel name VAL pieroangelo2 COL description VAL Charlie Foxx (October 23\, 1939 -- September 18\, 1998) and his sister Inez Foxx (born September 9\, 1942) were an African-American rhythm and blues and soul duo from Greensboro\, North Carolina. Inez sang lead vocal\, while Charlie sang back-up and played guitar.[1]   Their most successful record was with their novelty composition\, "Mockingbird". Released in 1963\, it made the Top 10 on both the rhythm and blues and pop charts; the song was later covered by artists including Aretha Franklin\, James Taylor\, Carly Simon\, Dusty Springfield and Toby Keith. Other notable recordings were "Hurt by Love\," "Ask Me\," and "(1-2-3-4-5-6-7) Count the Days."   They were known for their exciting live performances\, of which a highlight was Inez's rendition of "I Stand Accused"\, which finished with a supposedly distraught Inez singing the last verse\, while being carried offstage by Charlie. They toured extensively in Europe and their music played a key role in the development of the Northern Soul movement.   Inez also had some success recording on her own\, beginning in 1969\, but her popularity faded in the 1970s. Charlie was already working as a record producer when they finally disbanded their act.   Inez Foxx was married to the American songwriter and producer Luther Dixon. Together they wrote\, and he produced\, The Platters' mid-1960s return to hit-making with the single "I Love You 1000 Times".[2] Luther Dixon produced Inez and Charlie's 1967 album Come By Here\, but the couple later divorced.[2]   Charlie Foxx died from leukemia in 1998\, at the age of 58.	0

COL title VAL Sally Was a Good Old Girl COL performer VAL Trini Lopez	COL video title VAL NASHVILLE WEST (ft. Clarence White) - "Mental Revenge" - 1967 COL channel name VAL BobSeger1981 COL description VAL Nashville West included: Clarence White (Byrds)\, Gene Parsons\, Gib Guibeau and Wayne Moore. This is from the 1967\, self-titled\, album.  There are a few records that can be considered birthplaces of what has become known as "country-rock." Two Gene Clark albums\, Echoes and Fantastic Expedition\, come to mind\, as well as the Byrds' Sweetheart of the Rodeo and the International Submarine Band's debut. Add to that list -- and put it high up there -- Nashville West\, a self-titled debut by a group that consisted of Gib Guilbeau\, Wayne Moss\, and two future Byrds\, Gene Parsons and the great Clarence White\, and it's White's awesome guitar work that puts this album in a legendary context. Aside from the revolutionary playing by White\, the group has a forceful yet laid-back groove that\, if you like it on the first cut\, "Nashville West\," will have you digging the whole record. Parsons' drumming has a slightly soulful edge\, which predates the Flying Burrito Brothers' experiments by several years. One of the best cuts on the album is a cover of "Ode to Billy Joe\," which has White and Parsons laying into a groove that is indescribably delicious. Ignoring the historical value of this CD\, the whole record is a hell of a lot of fun.  Vocally\, not really what you'd call a masterpiece\, but it doesn't matter -- Nashville West is a record that should be owned by any fan of the Byrds\, the Flying Burrito Brothers\, Dillard & Clark\, and country music as a genre. Brilliant. ~ Matthew Greenwald	0

Autry was also owner of a television station\, several radio stations in Southern California\, and the Los Angeles/California/Anaheim Angels Major League Baseball team from 1961 to 1997.  From 1934 to 1953\, Autry appeared in 93 films and 91 episodes of The Gene Autry Show television series. During the 1930s and 1940s\, he personified the straight-shooting hero—honest\, brave\, and true—and profoundly touched the lives of millions of Americans. Autry was also one of the most important figures in the history of country music\, considered the second major influential artist of the genre's development after Jimmie Rodgers.[2] His singing cowboy movies were the first vehicle to carry country music to a national audience. ] In addition to his signature song\, "Back in the Saddle Again"\, Autry is still remembered for his Christmas holiday songs\, "Here Comes Santa Claus"\, which he wrote\, "Frosty the Snowman"\, and his biggest hit\, "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer".  Autry is a member of both the Country Music Hall of Fame and Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame\, and is the only person to be awarded stars in all five categories on the Hollywood Walk of Fame\, for film\, television\, music\, radio\, and live performance. The town of Gene Autry\, Oklahoma was named in his honor.	1

Era el verano claro está\, y yo empezaba a soñar con mi pasado. Ante un espejo le fingí que maquillaba mi nariz para mirarle. Cuando me vi tan cerca de él había dado no sé qué por conquistarle.  Me sonrió con intención y fue su edad la explicación de su victoria. No quiso hablarme del amor\, pues según él esa cuestión es otra historia. Me dijo tú me vas muy bien\, eres igual que la mujer de "El Graduado". Yo no pude resistir y entre sus brazos descubrí\, un sol dorado.  Dieciocho años nada más eso le hizo ser audaz mas que insolente. Cuando llegué a despertar\, solo sentí la soledad indiferente. Por un momento pretendí el retenerlo junto a mí\, pero no quise. Me dijo no has estado mal\, con un candor tan infernal\, antes de irse. Entonces tuve que fingir que maquillaba mi nariz\, para no verle y estuve a punto de olvidar que yo le doblaba la edad.	0

COL title VAL About a Quarter to Nine COL performer VAL Al Jolson	COL video title VAL Johnny Mathis ~ Southern Nights COL channel name VAL lenoremewton COL description VAL This upload is in honor of Johnny's recent Grammy nomination for his latest CD: "Let It Be Me: Mathis in Nashville". I love many songs on this CD - this is one of my favorites. Love Johnny's wonderful\, contagious energy  (catch that sweet 'yeehaw' moment - s'cuze me - that's what comes when I hear it! -  at about 2:35 - and that's him in those cool\, cute sneaks movin' in Cohasset this summer)\,  and the beautiful symphonic blend of his interpretation with the incredible musicians accompanying him. In researching the song I watched several videos of Jerry Douglas (Dobro)\, Bryan Sutton (Acoustic Guitar\, Banjo\, Mandolin)\, Stuart Duncan (Fiddle\, Mandolin) and others\, all like Johnny\, gifted\, and according to executive producer Jay Lander's liner notes\,  'handpicked group of Nashville's finest" by producer Fred Molin.  If you don't own it- well worth it- and the notes\, so descriptive of each song's history. And one can't improve on Lander's further notes: "Johnny Mathis draws the listener into his world like a master storyteller.....the emotions\, in Johnny's hands\, nothing less than profound." You are not listening to a set of songs put to voice and music here. If you do what country music\, I believe 'invites' you to do\,  slow down\, listen\, take in the sounds\, the meaning\, the simplicity\, the emotions and joy\, you'll hear these stories with every nuance available. Enjoy!  And I defy your feet or body to stay still listening to this rich number! And here's to Johnny\, once again\, the consummate re-inventor of his own style\,and yet always just a step away from the 'magic' core we all love.   The song\, composed by Allen Toussaint\, was released in 1977 by Glenn Campbell and hit #1 as a 'cross over' number that year in Country\, Pop and Adult Contemporary.	0

COL title VAL I Pity the Fool COL performer VAL Tedeschi Trucks Band	COL video title VAL Doug Sahm - Buzz buzz buzz COL channel name VAL DangerousDaveRR COL description VAL "Buzz buzz buzz" - many a great single was little more than a few nonsense words cobbled together. This single from the Hollywood Flames in '57 is a great example. And Doug and the boys give it a suitably rip-snorting treatment.  Doug Sahm was an artist who displayed a remarkable capacity for soaking up a wide variety of genres of popular music and demonstrating expertise in such genres\, often within one album.  Outside of a core set of enthusiastic admirers it is just this ability not to be typecast that may well have hampered his acceptance within the wider public domain. Relatively late in his career he recorded a small number of albums which concentrated on one genre or era of music. "Juke Box Music" is one of those albums. It focuses on music that was popular in the Southern US in the fifties. Much of this comes under the broad headings of R&B or doo-wop. The concept of the album is of a jukebox in that timeframe stacked to the gills with great music to dance or smooch to. Doug assembled an ace big band to interpret this music containing many musicians who'd been part of his various ventures in the past.  The main musicians appearing on the album are:  Doug Sahm - Vocals\, Piano & Guitar Rocky Morales - Tenor Sax Charlie McBurney - Trumpet Jack Barber - Bass George Rains - Drums  Addition musicians include:  Wayne Bennett - Guitar Derek O'Brien - Rhythm Guitar Mel Brown - Keyboards Reese Wynans - Keyboards Randy Garibay - Vocal duet Angela Strehli - Background vocals  Produced by George Rains Arrangements by Doug Sahm	0

COL title VAL The Maid of Amsterdam COL performer VAL Paul Clayton	COL video title VAL INEZ FOXX-i stand accuse COL channel name VAL pieroangelo2 COL description VAL Charlie Foxx (October 23\, 1939 -- September 18\, 1998) and his sister Inez Foxx (born September 9\, 1942) were an African-American rhythm and blues and soul duo from Greensboro\, North Carolina. Inez sang lead vocal\, while Charlie sang back-up and played guitar.[1]   Their most successful record was with their novelty composition\, "Mockingbird". Released in 1963\, it made the Top 10 on both the rhythm and blues and pop charts; the song was later covered by artists including Aretha Franklin\, James Taylor\, Carly Simon\, Dusty Springfield and Toby Keith. Other notable recordings were "Hurt by Love\," "Ask Me\," and "(1-2-3-4-5-6-7) Count the Days."   They were known for their exciting live performances\, of which a highlight was Inez's rendition of "I Stand Accused"\, which finished with a supposedly distraught Inez singing the last verse\, while being carried offstage by Charlie. They toured extensively in Europe and their music played a key role in the development of the Northern Soul movement.   Inez also had some success recording on her own\, beginning in 1969\, but her popularity faded in the 1970s. Charlie was already working as a record producer when they finally disbanded their act.   Inez Foxx was married to the American songwriter and producer Luther Dixon. Together they wrote\, and he produced\, The Platters' mid-1960s return to hit-making with the single "I Love You 1000 Times".[2] Luther Dixon produced Inez and Charlie's 1967 album Come By Here\, but the couple later divorced.[2]   Charlie Foxx died from leukemia in 1998\, at the age of 58.	0

COL title VAL Midnight at the Oasis COL performer VAL Maria Muldaur	COL video title VAL DENI HINES & CHRISTINE ANU - TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS COL channel name VAL denihines COL description VAL Two of Australias most loved and successful female recording artists\, Deni Hines and Christine Anu\, are takin it to the streets again in 2009 after the success of their 2008 East-Coast of Australia tour.    On the first tour we had such a great time\, that we wanted to do it all over again\, especially when we have such a great cause to promote such as the Salvation Army and Oasis Youth Support Network. We feel privileged to be able to help says Christine & Deni.    In a two hour show\, this sassy duo will perform their classic hits and favourite timeless songs along with some special duets\, including their own rendition of the Doobie Brothers hit TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS.   While promoting their 2008 tour\, Deni and Christine so happened to be performing one of their show duets TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS on the Today Show (Nine Network\, Australia). On the same show was a heartfelt segment about the plight of homelessness in Australia accompanied by Captain Paul Mould of the Salvation Armys Oasis Youth Support Network\, who take care and provide much needed services for the homeless and youth of Australia (who come from all walks of life.)  No less than 5 minutes after walking off set\, Christine and Deni turned to each other and said weve got to do something to help and the recording of TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS was set in motion.   Deni and Christine will release their version of TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS on 15 November 2008 (Nationwide) with fifty percent (50%) of profits going to the Salvation Armys Youth Homelessness Oasis Foundation and the Everyone Is Homeless Fund.  On Wednesday\, 17th December Christine and Deni will also stage a free Christmas concert version of their TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS show exclusively for the Salvation Armys Youth Homelessness Oasis Foundation and the homeless people of Sydney.   For further information on Salvation Armys Youth Homelessness Oasis Foundation and the Everyone Is Homeless Fund\, please refer to www.oasis.salvos.org.au  In the ABS Census 2001 (The 2006 Census data has not been finalized)\, there were 100\,000 homeless people (men\, women and children) across Australia\, one third (36\,173) are youth between 12-24 years of age.  Only 14.25% of homeless people were able to stay in services funded through SAAP (Supported Accommodation Assistance Program) jointly funded by both the Commonwealth and State Governments.  Christine and Deni would like to thank the following companies and people for donating their time and services free of charge of the purposes of this donation campaign drive -  301 Studios\, Sing Sing Studios\, David and Anthony @ DNA Songs\, Tony Espie\, David Walker at Stepford Audio\, John Adams\, Franco Raggatt\, Barbara Griffin\, Cameron Undy\, Michael Rohanek and Rob Thompson.	0

COL title VAL The Cruel Brother COL performer VAL The Gaugers	COL video title VAL Johnny Mathis ~ Southern Nights COL channel name VAL lenoremewton COL description VAL This upload is in honor of Johnny's recent Grammy nomination for his latest CD: "Let It Be Me: Mathis in Nashville". I love many songs on this CD - this is one of my favorites. Love Johnny's wonderful\, contagious energy  (catch that sweet 'yeehaw' moment - s'cuze me - that's what comes when I hear it! -  at about 2:35 - and that's him in those cool\, cute sneaks movin' in Cohasset this summer)\,  and the beautiful symphonic blend of his interpretation with the incredible musicians accompanying him. In researching the song I watched several videos of Jerry Douglas (Dobro)\, Bryan Sutton (Acoustic Guitar\, Banjo\, Mandolin)\, Stuart Duncan (Fiddle\, Mandolin) and others\, all like Johnny\, gifted\, and according to executive producer Jay Lander's liner notes\,  'handpicked group of Nashville's finest" by producer Fred Molin.  If you don't own it- well worth it- and the notes\, so descriptive of each song's history. And one can't improve on Lander's further notes: "Johnny Mathis draws the listener into his world like a master storyteller.....the emotions\, in Johnny's hands\, nothing less than profound." You are not listening to a set of songs put to voice and music here. If you do what country music\, I believe 'invites' you to do\,  slow down\, listen\, take in the sounds\, the meaning\, the simplicity\, the emotions and joy\, you'll hear these stories with every nuance available. Enjoy!  And I defy your feet or body to stay still listening to this rich number! And here's to Johnny\, once again\, the consummate re-inventor of his own style\,and yet always just a step away from the 'magic' core we all love.   The song\, composed by Allen Toussaint\, was released in 1977 by Glenn Campbell and hit #1 as a 'cross over' number that year in Country\, Pop and Adult Contemporary.	0

Hagemann was one of the leading tenor saxophonists in Denmark from the late 1930's to the late 1940's. He played in many well-known bands at that time i.e. Kai Ewans' Orchestra and Leo Mathisen's Band as well as leading own groups.  This particular recording was made by a pick-up band in Copenhagen on 20 January 1944. Although the label states a sextet playing\, the band consisted of eight musicians: Erik Parker (trumpet)\, Henry Hagemann (tenor sax)\, Aage Voss (baritone sax)\, Børge Roger Henrichsen (as "Henry Roger") (piano)\, Kjeld Bonfils (vibraphone)\, Svend Hauberg (guitar & vocal)\, Karlo Jensen (bass) and John Steffensen (drums).	0

COL title VAL Elämys kirkas oot COL performer VAL Kirka	COL video title VAL Johnny Mathis ~ Southern Nights COL channel name VAL lenoremewton COL description VAL This upload is in honor of Johnny's recent Grammy nomination for his latest CD: "Let It Be Me: Mathis in Nashville". I love many songs on this CD - this is one of my favorites. Love Johnny's wonderful\, contagious energy  (catch that sweet 'yeehaw' moment - s'cuze me - that's what comes when I hear it! -  at about 2:35 - and that's him in those cool\, cute sneaks movin' in Cohasset this summer)\,  and the beautiful symphonic blend of his interpretation with the incredible musicians accompanying him. In researching the song I watched several videos of Jerry Douglas (Dobro)\, Bryan Sutton (Acoustic Guitar\, Banjo\, Mandolin)\, Stuart Duncan (Fiddle\, Mandolin) and others\, all like Johnny\, gifted\, and according to executive producer Jay Lander's liner notes\,  'handpicked group of Nashville's finest" by producer Fred Molin.  If you don't own it- well worth it- and the notes\, so descriptive of each song's history. And one can't improve on Lander's further notes: "Johnny Mathis draws the listener into his world like a master storyteller.....the emotions\, in Johnny's hands\, nothing less than profound." You are not listening to a set of songs put to voice and music here. If you do what country music\, I believe 'invites' you to do\,  slow down\, listen\, take in the sounds\, the meaning\, the simplicity\, the emotions and joy\, you'll hear these stories with every nuance available. Enjoy!  And I defy your feet or body to stay still listening to this rich number! And here's to Johnny\, once again\, the consummate re-inventor of his own style\,and yet always just a step away from the 'magic' core we all love.   The song\, composed by Allen Toussaint\, was released in 1977 by Glenn Campbell and hit #1 as a 'cross over' number that year in Country\, Pop and Adult Contemporary.	0

Purchase from the label: http://www.paradiseofbachelors.com/shop/pob-21 Purchase from Bandcamp: https://paradiseofbachelors.bandcamp.com/album/ambsace Other options: http://lnk.to/PoB21  The second album of astonishing duets by guitarists James Elkington (who has toured and/or recorded with Jeff Tweedy\, Richard Thompson\, and Steve Gunn\, among others) and Nathan Salsburg (an accomplished soloist deemed by NPR “one of those names we’ll all associate with American folk guitar”) is a sublime suite of nimble\, filigreed compositions by two singular stylists. Belying its title—“ambsace” is the lowest throw of dice; snake eyes—the record thrives on a gentle empathy and generosity of spirit\, sitting sneakily protean original compositions alongside gorgeous arrangements of songs by Duke Ellington and The Smiths at the same big hand-hewn table.

She speaks fluently Spanish\, English and Italian. Due to her great voice\, she has been compared to famous international singers\, to Whitney Houston above all. Session vocalist for various Dance productions in the 90's\, she's been performing a lot around the World and has taken part in many TV shows in Italy. She's also an author: she wrote for Mario Biondi on the albums 'Handful of soul' and 'I love you more'\, she co-wrote most of the songs on the Papik album 'Rhythm of life'\, together with her producer Nerio Poggi (aka Papik)\, including 'Staying for Good'\, the single from the album that's getting a great response worldwide. This is her first album under her own name and it's dedicated to remakes in a soul-jazz style of tunes from the 80's and 90's. Among the songs chosen: a bossa cover of 'Rhythm of the night' by Corona and an R&B version of 'Barbie Girl'. But the self-penned '1986' is the real gem on this album!

COL title VAL Pride and Joy COL performer VAL Tomas Nicholas	COL video title VAL Jessica Williams - Green Chimneys (T.Monk) COL channel name VAL André Rodrigues Pereira da Silva COL description VAL Review from allmusic:  «Recorded at a special afternoon series sponsored by Chemekata College in Oregon\, Jazz in the Afternoon is a trio date\, with Williams joined by Dave Captein on bass and Mel Brown on drums. The recording is surprisingly dense however\, with Williams spraying notes all over on her solo for the Monk tune "Green Chimneys" which opens the set. Captein and Brown both sound enthused by the sprightly playing and keep up the pace admirably. Williams changes directions often\, moving with a smooth grace from the stately "Light Blue" (another Monk piece) to a barreling "Straight\, No Chaser" (ditto\, obviously) to Gershwin's playful "Swanee." Her playing never falters throughout the 70-minute recording. Though Williams recorded several excellent live albums\, Jazz in the Afternoon is another great addition to her discography. »	0

COL title VAL Laleña COL performer VAL Waldo de los Ríos y su Orquesta	COL video title VAL NASHVILLE WEST (ft. Clarence White) - "Mental Revenge" - 1967 COL channel name VAL BobSeger1981 COL description VAL Nashville West included: Clarence White (Byrds)\, Gene Parsons\, Gib Guibeau and Wayne Moore. This is from the 1967\, self-titled\, album.  There are a few records that can be considered birthplaces of what has become known as "country-rock." Two Gene Clark albums\, Echoes and Fantastic Expedition\, come to mind\, as well as the Byrds' Sweetheart of the Rodeo and the International Submarine Band's debut. Add to that list -- and put it high up there -- Nashville West\, a self-titled debut by a group that consisted of Gib Guilbeau\, Wayne Moss\, and two future Byrds\, Gene Parsons and the great Clarence White\, and it's White's awesome guitar work that puts this album in a legendary context. Aside from the revolutionary playing by White\, the group has a forceful yet laid-back groove that\, if you like it on the first cut\, "Nashville West\," will have you digging the whole record. Parsons' drumming has a slightly soulful edge\, which predates the Flying Burrito Brothers' experiments by several years. One of the best cuts on the album is a cover of "Ode to Billy Joe\," which has White and Parsons laying into a groove that is indescribably delicious. Ignoring the historical value of this CD\, the whole record is a hell of a lot of fun.  Vocally\, not really what you'd call a masterpiece\, but it doesn't matter -- Nashville West is a record that should be owned by any fan of the Byrds\, the Flying Burrito Brothers\, Dillard & Clark\, and country music as a genre. Brilliant. ~ Matthew Greenwald	0

Luister zonder advertenties met YouTube Premium  Rotterdams mondorgeltrio rond Geert van Driesten. Ze beleven hun hoogtijdagen in de jaren vijftig en begin jaren zestig\, met als hoogtepunt het optreden in de show van Dorus 1935 - 1945 Geert van Driesten richt\, geïnspireerd door de Amerikaanse mondharpgroep Borrah Minevitch & his Harmonica Rascals\, The 5 Hotcha's (Mexicaans voor 'muzikale zwerver') op. Aanvankelijk spelen ze veel in Engeland\, met de beroemde band van Jack Hylton. Ook spelen de Hotcha's tot de oorlog in Parijs\, Brussel en verschillende steden in Duitsland.   1945 - 1950 Minevitch vraagt Driesten om naar Amerika te komen. Driesten bedankt voor de eer en in plaats daarvan richt hij de Eerste Nederlandse Chromatische Mondharmonica School op. Driesten stelt zich ten doel om\, met behulp van deze school in Rotterdam\, de mondharp als serieus concertinstrument geaccepteerd te krijgen. Daarnaast is hij nog steeds de voorman van de Hotcha's\, inmiddels teruggebracht tot Hotcha Trio met Eddy Sernee en Joop Heijman. Met hun clowneske show en allerhande idioterie groeit de faam van het Hotcha Trio gestaag.  1950 - 1960 In 1951 neemt het Hotcha Trio hun eerste plaatje op: een 78-toerenplaat met het lied Honeysuckle Rose en op de B-kant Chattanoogie Shoe Shine Boy. Sernee heeft inmiddels plaatsgemaakt voor Henk van Dipte\, die akkoorden speelt op de 'rol' (acht tot een cilinder samengeklonken harmonica's in verschillende toonsoorten). Driesten speelt op de basharmonica en Heijman is de solist. De swingende\, energieke liedjes van de Hotcha's weten een alsmaar groeiend publiek aan te spreken. Het trio komt veelvuldig op de radio en later ook op televisie in de show van Dorus.  1960 - 1970 De eerste jaren van de jaren zestig is het Hotcha Trio nog steeds erg populair. Het repertoire van het trio verandert echter onder de druk van de oprukkende beatmuziek: de jazz van liedjes als Honeysuckle Rose heeft plaatsgemaakt voor meedeiners als Der Onkel Jonathan en De Zilvervloot. Het variété-tijdperk is zo langzamerhand afgelopen\, de tijdgeest is veranderd en de populariteit van de Hotcha's neemt razendsnel af. Een bijkomend probleem is dat de akkoordenspelers nooit lang trouw blijven aan het trio: na Van Dipte volgen achtereenvolgens Lee Kuipers\, Gijs van der Wiel\, Jan Vuik en Frans Pauli. In 1970 besluit Van Driesten in stilte om een punt te zetten achter de ooit zo glansrijke carrière van het Hotcha Trio.	0

This ranks among Dion's best stuff\, and everyone out there ought to dig this track! There are lots of versions of this song out there by many different artists\, but this is the best one I have heard of all of them. I will admit that for the sake of having a good sounding copy\, i swiped the audio off of the cd version so it is the album length rather than the single edit\, but i rarely do something like that for my videos. At least you know you'll be getting what you hear if you go out and buy this on cd! You can hear killer tunes like this one live every night on www.topshelfoldies.com!	0

COL title VAL I Second That Emotion COL performer VAL José Feliciano	COL video title VAL Kim Wilde - A Little Respect COL channel name VAL José Teixeira COL description VAL #kimwilde - A Little Respect  Song written and originally recorded by Erasure.  Erasure version The British synthpop duo Erasure released 'A Little Respect' in September 1988 as their tenth single. The single was taken from their album 'The Innocents'. The lyric is an empowering plea to a lover to show compassion and respect.  Kim Wilde version Kim Wilde performed this song live during her European tour in March/April 2009 and subsequent festival performances in the summer of 2009. She continued to perform the song in 2010 and during the 'Come Out and Play' tour in March 2011. In August 2011 the song was released as a studio recording on Kim's album Snapshots.  Kim about 'A little respect' 'A Little Respect' is a great song by Erasure\, Vince Clark and Andy Bell\, and I remember it came out in 1988 which was a really important year for me. I had 'Close' out which did really well\, and of course I was on tour with Michael Jackson\, so it all kindof kicked off that year. Every time I hear this song it just takes me back to that fantastic time in my career.  Andy Bell absolutely loved it and has told us so\, so that's one of the reasons why it's on [Pop Don't Stop\, the greatest hits compilation]. It was fully endorsed by him and he loves it\, so that means the world to us. Source: https://www.wilde-life.com/encyclopedia/a/a-little-respect  Lyrics: I try to discover A little something to make me sweeter Oh baby refrain from breaking my heart I'm so in love with you I'll be forever blue That you give me no reason Why you're making me work so hard  That you give me no That you give me no That you give me no That you give me no  Soul\, I hear you calling Oh baby please give a little respect to me  And if I should falter Would you open your arms out to me We can make love not war And live at peace in our hearts I'm so in love with you I'll be forever blue What religion or reason Could drive a man to forsake his lover  Don't you tell me no Don't you tell me no Don't you tell me no Don't you tell me no  Soul\, I hear you calling Oh baby please give a little respect to me  I'm so in love with you I'll be forever blue That you give me no reason You know you're making me work so hard  That you give me no That you give me no That you give me no That you give me no  Soul\, I hear you calling Oh baby please give a little respect to me Soul\, I hear you calling Oh baby please give a little respect to me	0

COL title VAL How Ya Gonna Keep 'Em Down on the Farm COL performer VAL Andrew Bird	COL video title VAL The Mar-Keys - Last Night COL channel name VAL englishnbloodyproudo COL description VAL The Mar-Keys\, formed in 1958\, were an American studio session band for the Stax label from Memphis\, Tennessee\, in the 1960s. As the first house band for the label\, their backing music formed the foundation for the early 1960s Stax sound.  The group began as The Royal Spades and had tried unsuccessfully to get a record made for the local Satellite Records even though tenor sax player Charles "Packy" Axton's mother and uncle owned that label. When they were finally able to get a record made\, Axton's mother Estelle Axton convinced the group to change their name and they chose The Mar-Keys.  They also recorded organ and saxophone oriented singles of their own\, scoring a number three hit nationally with "Last Night" in 1961. It sold over one million copies\, earning gold disc recognition. Keyboards were played by Jerry Lee "Smoochy" Smith. Other singles of theirs from the early 1960s include "Philly Dog" and "Popeye Stroll." Members of this rhythm section later formed other nationally prominent Memphis studio session groups\, including the Memphis Horns\, the Packers\, and Booker T. & the M.G.'s. Each of these offshoot groups also recorded popular instrumental albums of their own\, in addition to serving as the backing band on albums by dozens of rock\, R&B\, and soul music stars on Stax\, Volt and other national labels. The legacy of the Mar-Keys and later groups was that of having been key players in the development of soul music styles like Southern soul and Memphis soul.	0

COL title VAL Little Old Lady COL performer VAL Julie Andrews	COL video title VAL Mitch Miller - The River Kwai March ~ Colonel Bogey March COL channel name VAL ubsswp COL description VAL RIP Mitch Miller! He died 99 years old!  Mitchell William Miller (July 4\, 1911 -- July 31\, 2010)was an American musician\, singer\, conductor\, record producer\, A&R man and record company executive. He was one of the most influential figures in American popular music during the 1950s and early 1960s.  In the early '50s Miller recorded with Columbia's house band as "Mitchell Miller and His Orchestra". He also recorded a string of successful albums and singles\, featuring a male chorale and his own distinctive arrangements\, under the name "Mitch Miller and the Gang" starting in 1950. The ensemble's hits included "Tzena\, Tzena\, Tzena"\, "The Yellow Rose of Texas"\, and the two marches from The Bridge on the River Kwai: "The River Kwai March and Colonel Bogey March".  The Bridge on the River Kwai is a British 1957 World War II film by David Lean; based on the novel The Bridge over the River Kwai by French writer Pierre Boulle. The film is a work of fiction but borrows the construction of the Burma Railway in 1942-43 for its historical setting. It stars Alec Guinness\, Sessue Hayakawa\, Jack Hawkins and William Holden.  In 1997\, this film was deemed "culturally\, historically\, or aesthetically significant" and selected for preservation in the United States Library of Congress National Film Registry.  Two prisoners of war are burying a corpse in the graveyard of a Japanese World War II prison camp in southern Burma. One\, American Navy Commander Shears (William Holden)\, routinely bribes guards to ensure he gets sick duty\, which allows him to avoid hard labour. A large contingent of British prisoners arrives\, marching in defiantly whistling the Colonel Bogey March under the leadership of Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness).  A memorable feature of the film is the tune that is whistled by the POWs—the "Colonel Bogey March"—when they enter the camp.The piece was originally written in 1914 by Kenneth Alford. It was accompanied by a counter-melody (known as "The River Kwai March") written by the film's composer\, Malcolm Arnold\, and played by the off-screen orchestra taking over from the whistlers. Mitch Miller had a hit with a recording of both marches.	0
