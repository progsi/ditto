Even compared to other renditions the same song by powerhouse vocalists like Anita O'Day\, Bobby Short\, and jazz vocalist ever\, Ella Fitzgerald\, Stritch's remains favorite. (My second version Judy Garland's in her "Born Trunk" medley; sadly\, it disconnected\, not through-and-through should have been). Her brassy\, throaty\, mostly straight-toned vocals seem those for which this works best.  I hate that voice has suffered as through time\, thanks booze cigarettes. In prime\, she was good singer anyone ten times unique. "C'est la vie" our friends might say. We still recordings prove at some point\, WAS singer. ** DO NOT OWN THE COPYRIGHT TO THIS RECORDING.
