"After You've Gone" was recorded on their first session for the label and there seems to have been some growing pains. The balance is not as good as on the other labels\, with especially weak recording of the bass.  The opening chorus is by Grappelli this time around and he is immediately followed by the Louis Armstrong-inspired singing of Freddie Taylor. It seems that everyone is holding back in these opening choruses\, and sure enough\, as soon as Taylor is finished\, the intensity goes up as Django goes into a finger-busting chorus filled with fast arpeggios and runs\, and concluding with a chorded intro to Grappelli. The violinist takes charge\, building the intensity with every chorus. The breaks\, built into the tune at the end of each 16-bar section\, seem to have little effect on Taylor\, but each time Reinhardt and Grappelli hit them\, they add to the growing excitement of the recording.   1936 May 4 - Gramophone\, Paris COL channel name VAL Heinz Becker	0

Lyrics: Well I heard there was a secret chord that David played and it pleased the Lord But you don't really care for music\, do ya? Well it goes like this : The fourth\, the fifth\, the minor fall and the major lift The baffled king composing Hallelujah  Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah...  Well your faith was strong but you needed proof You saw her bathing on the roof Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya And she tied you to her kitchen chair She broke your throne and she cut your hair And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah  Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah...  Yeah but Baby I've been here before I've seen this room and I've walked this floor\, (You know) I used to live alone before I knew ya And I've seen your flag on the marble arch and love is not a victory march It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah  Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah...  Well there was a time when you let me know What's really going on below But now you never show that to me do ya But remember when I moved in you And the holy dove was moving too And every breath we drew was Hallelujah  Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah  Hallelujah...  Maybe there's a God above But all I've ever learned from love Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya And it's not a cry that you hear at night It's not somebody who's seen the light It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah  Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelu...

Arranged by James E. Bond\, Jr. Produced by Nick Venet.  Joanie\, who scored a #7 US hit with “Johnny Get Angry” in the summer of 1962\, didn’t return to Hot-100 after “When The Boys Get Together” charted in October of the same year.  Some great records followed on Warners\, however\, including the northern soul favorite\, “Don’t Pity Me” in 1965. By 1967\, Joanie was with Columbia\, where she released a number of Bacharach-David on 45; “Alfie”\, “It Doesn’t Matter Anymore” and “Take A Broken Heart”.   The following year\, Joanie had moved to Capitol but still retained an affinity for Bacharach-David songs by releasing “Trains And Boats And Planes”.  Other great versions of this Bacharach-David classic: Billy J Kramer & The Dakotas (1965\, US #47) and Dionne Warwick (1966\, US #22). COL channel name VAL 45rpmMike	0

COL title VAL Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye COL performer VAL Lady Gaga	COL video title VAL Betty Carter - Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye (Bet-Car Records 1982) COL description VAL "Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye" is a song with lyrics and music by Cole Porter. It was introduced in 1944 in Billy Rose's musical revue\, Seven Lively Arts. It is interesting to note that in the phrase "change from major to minor\," Mr. Porter begins with an Ab major chord and ends with an Ab minor one\, cleverly matching words and music. The song has since become a jazz standard after gaining popularity in the late 1950s and early 1960s.  Many artists have replaced the apostrophe in "ev'ry" with an "e" and have combined "time" to form the more common "everytime."  Betty Carter (born Lillie Mae Jones\, May 16\, 1929 -- September 26\, 1998) was an American jazz singer known for her improvisational technique\, scatting abilities\, and other complex musical abilities that demonstrated her vocal talent and imaginative interpretation of lyrics and melodies. Vocalist Carmen McRae once remarked\, "there's really only one jazz singer - only one: Betty Carter."  Carter continued to perform\, tour\, and record\, as well as search for new talent until she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in the summer of 1998. Betty Carter died on September 26\, 1998\, at the age of 69\, and was later cremated.  Carter often recruited young accompanists for performances and recordings\, insisting that she "learned a lot from these young players\, because they're raw and they come up with things that I would never think about doing." 1993 was Carter's biggest year of innovation\, creating a program called Jazz Ahead\, which took 20 students who were given the opportunity to spend an entire week training and composing with Carter\, a program that still exists to this day and is hosted in The Kennedy Center.  Betty Carter is considered responsible for discovering great jazz talent\, her list including such names as John Hicks\, Curtis Lundy\, Mulgrew Miller\, Cyrus Chestnut\, Dave Holland\, Stephen Scott\, Kenny Washington\, Benny Green and more.  Betty's accompanied by David Amram (Arranger & Conductor)\, Curtis Lundy (Bass)\, Lewis Nash (Drums)\, Khalid Moss (Piano)\, Jerry Dodgion (Saxophone [Alto]).  Everytime we say goodbye\, I die a little I wonder why a little  When you're near\, feels like spring  Everytime we say goodbye\, I die a little Everytime we say goodbye\, I wonder why a little Why the Gods above me\, who must be in the know How could they think so little of me\, that they allow you to go  When you're near\, there's such an air of spring about it I can hear a lark somewhere\, begin to sing about it There's no love song finer\, but how strange the change from major to minor Everytime we say goodbye Everytime we say goodbye\, I cry COL channel name VAL RoundMidnightTV	1

Sonny Knight and the Lakers 'Do It Live'\, from the eponymous group\, is a loving return to the height of live Rhythm and Blues\, with Knight and his band perfectly capturing the uproarious vibe and rebellious musicianship of an era long gone in their first live album release. A year of steady touring through the US and Europe has allowed the group to create a seamless set\, mixing songs from their critically-acclaimed debut studio album\, I’m Still Here\, with a couple covers of classic soul songs from their native Minneapolis\,  and re-imagined bits from Led Zeppelin and James Brown. Recorded in their hometown of Minneapolis at the Dakota Jazz Club over two nights and four performances\, Sonny Knight and the Lakers aim to bring a new focus on the art of the live record. Hoping to add to the rich history of live albums rather than producing something merely derivative\, they set out to reconstruct the ephemeral experience of a live concert and earn a permanent place on your record shelf".

Ring Of Fire  ------------------------  "Ring of Fire" or "The Ring of Fire" is a country music song popularized by Johnny Cash and co-written by June Carter (wife of Johnny Cash) and Merle Kilgore. The single appears on Cash's 1963 compilation album\, Ring of Fire: The Best of Johnny Cash. The song was originally recorded by June's sister\, Anita Carter\, on her Mercury Records album Folk Songs Old and New (1963) as "(Love's) Ring of Fire".  When the song failed to become a major hit for Anita\, Cash recorded it his own way\, adding the mariachi-style horns. This sound was later used in the song "It Ain't Me Babe"\, which was recorded around the same time. Mother Maybelle and the Carter sisters are prominently featured in the Cash recording singing harmony. Cash tinkered with a few of the original phrases in Anita Carter's version of the song:  Four years after the song was released\, Carter and Cash were married\, which Cash states helped to stop his alcohol and drug addictions. Cash's daughter Rosanne has stated\, "The song is about the transformative power of love and that's what it has always meant to me and that's what it will always mean to the Cash children.  The song was recorded on March 25\, 1963\, and became the biggest hit of Johnny Cash's career\, staying at number one on the charts for seven weeks.  Legacy  The most commercially successful cover version is by Social Distortion\, who released their punk rock version on the album Social Distortion (1990). The single reached #25 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks\, 27 years after the song was first recorded by Cash. Pop punk band Bowling for Soup would later cover the song on their live album Bowling for Soup: Live and Very Attractive.  The Eric Burdon & the Animals version\, recorded at the end of 1968\, charted in 1969 in the following countries: UK: #35\, GER: #24\, AUS: #10\, AU: #8\, NL: #4; it failed to chart in the US. In late 1974\, the Eric Burdon Band released a heavier version. In 2006\, Burdon performed the song sometimes at his concerts.  A cover of the song was released as a single by Alan Jackson on December 6\, 2010. His rendition of the song also features guest vocals from Lee Ann Womack. It peaked at #45\, becoming his first single to miss the Top 40 since "Blue Blooded Woman" also peaked at #45 in 1990.  Dwight Yoakam also recorded a version of the song\, on his debut album Guitars\, Cadillacs\, Etc.\, Etc.  The song was covered by Frank Zappa in the late 1980s\, and is offered on the 1995 The Best Band You Never Heard in Your Life. release showcasing a short-lived band lineup from a late-1988 tour. Zappa introduces the song by saying he'd met Johnny Cash that afternoon\, and that Johnny was going to come to the show and play with Zappa and his band\, but "his wife got sick." Zappa and the band proceed to play a seriously gonzo reggae version of the song\, with a caricature vocal impersonation of Johnny Cash. A euphemistic take on the song's title (meaning anal/rectal discomfort) permeates the song\, and a number of other numbers throughout the Best Band release. In the early 1980's\, the experimental/new wave band "Wall of Voodoo" (Mexican Radio) recorded a version of "Ring of Fire" that included extended guitar and synthesizer solos. This version of song can be found on the Wall of Voodoo compilation album "Grandma's House\," and can also be heard as background music in the adult film "Night Dreams." This version of the song also includes some slight rearrangement in so much as the repeating background music (layered behind the synth and lead guitar solos at the end of the song\,) borrows very heavily from the repeating incidental music in the "Flint" movies\, ("In Like Flint"\, "Our Man Flint\,") starring James Coburn.  The song is sung at the Molineux by the fans of Wolverhampton Wanderers  Use in media  "Ring of Fire" ranked #4 on CMT's 100 Greatest Songs in Country Music in 2003 and #87 on Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.  The song has also been featured in some video games: the original 1963 song was featured in Tony Hawk's Underground 2\, while a live version recorded in 1987 appeared in Guitar Hero 5 (which features a virtual avatar of Cash). The Social Distortion cover is a downloadable track for the Rock Band series (with the original song also confirmed for download in Rock Band 3) and is featured in Shaun White Snowboarding.  Blondie performed the song in the film Roadie (1980). The live recording was featured on the film soundtrack\, and on a reissue of the Blondie album Eat to the Beat.  It is heard briefly during a scene of the 2006 film Silent Hill. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

It was produced by Paul A. Rothchild and engineered by Bruce Botnick.  The song was released as the A-side of Elektra single 45605 in July\, 1966. The B-side was "No. Fourteen"\, supposedly the 'answer' to the half-sentence formed by the A-side's title but actually an out-take from the band's earlier recordings.  "7 and 7 Is" made the Billboard Pop Singles chart on July 30\, 1966\, peaking at number 33 during a ten-week chart run and becoming the band's highest-charting hit single. The recording also featured on the band's second album\, Da Capo.  The song drew inspiration from a high school sweetheart of Arthur Lee's\, Anita "Pretty" Billings\, who shared his birthday\, March 7. It also describes Lee's frustration at teenage life - the reference to "in my lonely room I'd sit\, my mind in an ice cream cone" being to wearing (in reality or metaphorically) a dunce's cap.  It took a great deal of work to record\, with Love's drummer\, Alban "Snoopy" Pfisterer\, being challenged with its frantic demands after 30 takes or so\, and being replaced on drums\, intermittently\, by Arthur Lee himself. It is not clear whether the version eventually released features Pfisterer or Lee\, but according to Johnny Echols (lead guitar)\, in an interview in the book Forever Changes (pg 117) stated that the drumming on the record was Pfisterer. The song climaxes in an apocalyptic explosion - the supposed sound of an atom bomb - before a peaceful conclusion\, in a blues form\, which then fades out. Although many listeners thought that the explosion at the end of the song was a reverb unit being kicked or dropped\, it was (according to the engineer Bruce Botnick in "Forever Changes" book\, page 118)\, in actuality\, taken from a sound effects record. He speculated that it was a recording of a gunshot slowed down. (For live performances\, the explosion was reproduced by kicking a reverb unit.)  Music critic Robert Christgau called "7 and 7 Is" "a perfect rocker."  Described as "protopunk"\, it was later covered by numerous bands\, most notably: Ramones\, Alice Cooper\, The Electric Prunes and Rush\, as well as a re-recording by Lee himself.  The song was used in the film Bottle Rocket\, handpicked by director Wes Anderson and music composer Mark Mothersbaugh. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

COL title VAL Five Foot Two\, Eyes of Blue COL performer VAL Freddy Cannon	COL video title VAL Gordon Franks and His Orchestra - Brazil COL description VAL If ever a list would be compiled\, ranking the number of cover versions existing of a particular song\, guess Ary Barroso's "Brazil" would surely be in the "top10".  Originally published in 1939\, the song has been performed by numerous vocalists and instrumentalists since then.  Sinatra\, Cugat\, Conniff\, Rosemary Clooney\, Harry Belafonte\, and yes\, even Placido Domingo recorded their versions of the song\, amongst many others.  "Aquarela do Brasil"\, as the song was titled originally by Barroso\, had a "difficult start" in the early years after its release and it was only in 1942 that the composition became a worldwide success after.........having appeared in Walt Disney's animation movie "Saludos Amigos".  With its popularity climbing to unseen 'heights' in the US\, soon English lyrics had to be added and songwriter Bob Russell got the 'job'.  Recently\, in 2009\, the 1942 version of "Brazil" by Jimmy Dorsey and his Orchestra was added to the Grammy Hall of Fame by the GA Academy.   Here Gordon Franks and his fabulous orchestra bring us ( at least that's what we think )- one of the best arrangements "ever" of this evergreen. From the 1967 album "Orchestral in the Night" here are Gordon Franks and His Orchestra taking you on a musical trip to .... Brazil !  Enjoy. COL channel name VAL Socratess2007	0

COL title VAL Mi príncipe vendrá COL performer VAL Lupita Pérez Arias	COL video title VAL Lorez Alexandria -- Baltimore Oriole (1957 Version) COL description VAL Continuing with saga of America's most gifted\, and underrated jazz vocalists—this particular artist takes the cake—not meaning the particular term in a negative connotation\, but it's such a pity that a remarkable songstress—the incomparable\, Lorez Alexandria is not afforded the recognition that she so deserves. This is proven true\, given the fact that I recently discovered her albums—and I just haven't had my fill. I've searched and purchased everything I could find from such a gifted songstress. Lorez crafts each lyric with such grace and tonality that could easily match (if not surpass) the reigning jazz stylists of the bop/jazz/pop age. She gives each standard a new sense of evocative meaning as far as lyrics are concerned\, and reinvents the wheel each time she unleashes her enthralling voice. As she once said "A lyric is dead\, until you breathe life into it." This is exactly what she does. Enjoy and listen in HD\, to the lovely—Lorez Alexandria.

COL title VAL Moody's Mood for Love COL performer VAL Van Morrison	COL video title VAL Johnny Cash - Wanted Man - Live at San Quentin (Good Sound Quality) COL description VAL Another great song from the San Quentin Prison concert of February 1969\, this one co-written with Bob Dylan.  Whilst I have a rather different world view from the late great Johnny Cash\, I'm nevertheless a big fan. He's the reason I first picked up a guitar in 2003. I always wanted to see live concert footage\, but with good clear sound\, so decided to synchronise the sound from my CD with TV footage available on Youtube. Easier said than done though... The TV footage is faster and about a whole tone higher in pitch\, so I had to slow the video down to match it with the audio.   I know I'm blatantly flaunting copyright guidlines\, but I reckon a few people might like this so much that they go out and buy the CD... like I did when I first heard the Man in Black on the radio!

No one could steer me right but Mama tried\, Mama tried Mama tried to raise me better\, but her pleading\, I denied That leaves only me to blame 'cause Mama tried Dear old Daddy\, rest his soul\, Left my Mom a heavy load\, She tried so very hard to fill his shoes Working hours without rest\, Wanted me to have the best She tried to raise me right but I refused I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole No one could steer me right but Mama tried\, Mama tried\, Mama tried to raise me better\, but her pleading\, I denied That leaves only me to blame 'cause Mama tried --  (C) 1968 Capitol Records COL channel name VAL Country At Its Finest	0

COL title VAL Baltimore Oriole COL performer VAL Lorez Alexandria	COL video title VAL Hoagy Carmichael -- Baltimore Oriole COL description VAL Howard Hoagland Carmichael (n. Bloomington\, Indiana\, 22 de noviembre de 1899 - f. Palm Springs\, 27 de diciembre de 1981)\, conocido como Hoagy Carmichael\, fue un compositor\, cantante y pianista estadounidense de música popular y de jazz.  Está considerado como uno de los grandes compositores de la canción popular estadounidense; entre sus canciones\, muchas de ellas consideradas clásicos\, se encuentran títulos como «Stardust»\, «Georgia on My Mind»\, «Up the Lazy River»\, «Rockin' Chair»\, «The Nearness of You»\, «Heart and Soul»\, «In the Cool\, Cool\, Cool of the Evening»\, «Skylark» y «New Orleans».  Carmichael\, quien trabajó por poco tiempo como abogado\, fue desde sus comienzos un entusiasta del jazz\, y en particular de la corneta de Bix Beiderbecke. Su primera composición\, «Riverboat Shuffle»\, fue grabada por Bix and the Wolverines en 1924 y se convirtió en un estándar de Dixieland. Carmichael\, como pianista\, vocalista y ocasional trompetista\, abandonó la abogacía para centrarse en el jazz\, concretamente tras grabar «Washboard Blues» con Paul Whiteman en 1927.  Lideró algunas sesiones de jazz propias a finales de los años veinte\, pero se hizo mucho más popular como compositor de canciones. Hacia 1935 estaba trabajando en Hollywood y actuó como ocasional actor secundario\, apareciendo en 14 películas\, entre las que se cuentan títulos tan importantes como Tener y no tener (To Have and Have Not) y Los mejores años de nuestra vida (The Best Years of Our Lives).  En los cuarenta\, Carmichael grabó varias sesiones en trío de sus éxitos y en 1956 grabó un conjunto de canciones respaldado por una banda de jazz moderno que incluía a Art Pepper. Tras ello\, medio se retiró\, insatisfecho con los cambios del negocio musical. Sus dos autobiografías (The Stardust Road de 1946 y Sometimes I Wonder de 1965) son muy valiosas.

Unknown Territory 13. Ring Of Fire  ------------------------  "Ring of Fire" or "The Ring of Fire" is a country music song popularized by Johnny Cash and co-written by June Carter (wife of Johnny Cash) and Merle Kilgore. The single appears on Cash's 1963 compilation album\, Ring of Fire: The Best of Johnny Cash. The song was originally recorded by June's sister\, Anita Carter\, on her Mercury Records album Folk Songs Old and New (1963) as "(Love's) Ring of Fire".  When the song failed to become a major hit for Anita\, Cash recorded it his own way\, adding the mariachi-style horns. This sound was later used in the song "It Ain't Me Babe"\, which was recorded around the same time. Mother Maybelle and the Carter sisters are prominently featured in the Cash recording singing harmony. Cash tinkered with a few of the original phrases in Anita Carter's version of the song:  Four years after the song was released\, Carter and Cash were married\, which Cash states helped to stop his alcohol and drug addictions. Cash's daughter Rosanne has stated\, "The song is about the transformative power of love and that's what it has always meant to me and that's what it will always mean to the Cash children.  The song was recorded on March 25\, 1963\, and became the biggest hit of Johnny Cash's career\, staying at number one on the charts for seven weeks.  Legacy  The most commercially successful cover version is by Social Distortion\, who released their punk rock version on the album Social Distortion (1990). The single reached #25 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks\, 27 years after the song was first recorded by Cash. Pop punk band Bowling for Soup would later cover the song on their live album Bowling for Soup: Live and Very Attractive.  The Eric Burdon & the Animals version\, recorded at the end of 1968\, charted in 1969 in the following countries: UK: #35\, GER: #24\, AUS: #10\, AU: #8\, NL: #4; it failed to chart in the US. In late 1974\, the Eric Burdon Band released a heavier version. In 2006\, Burdon performed the song sometimes at his concerts.  A cover of the song was released as a single by Alan Jackson on December 6\, 2010. His rendition of the song also features guest vocals from Lee Ann Womack. It peaked at #45\, becoming his first single to miss the Top 40 since "Blue Blooded Woman" also peaked at #45 in 1990.  Dwight Yoakam also recorded a version of the song\, on his debut album Guitars\, Cadillacs\, Etc.\, Etc.  The song was covered by Frank Zappa in the late 1980s\, and is offered on the 1995 The Best Band You Never Heard in Your Life. release showcasing a short-lived band lineup from a late-1988 tour. Zappa introduces the song by saying he'd met Johnny Cash that afternoon\, and that Johnny was going to come to the show and play with Zappa and his band\, but "his wife got sick." Zappa and the band proceed to play a seriously gonzo reggae version of the song\, with a caricature vocal impersonation of Johnny Cash. A euphemistic take on the song's title (meaning anal/rectal discomfort) permeates the song\, and a number of other numbers throughout the Best Band release. In the early 1980's\, the experimental/new wave band "Wall of Voodoo" (Mexican Radio) recorded a version of "Ring of Fire" that included extended guitar and synthesizer solos. This version of song can be found on the Wall of Voodoo compilation album "Grandma's House\," and can also be heard as background music in the adult film "Night Dreams." This version of the song also includes some slight rearrangement in so much as the repeating background music (layered behind the synth and lead guitar solos at the end of the song\,) borrows very heavily from the repeating incidental music in the "Flint" movies\, ("In Like Flint"\, "Our Man Flint\,") starring James Coburn.  The song is sung at the Molineux by the fans of Wolverhampton Wanderers  Use in media  "Ring of Fire" ranked #4 on CMT's 100 Greatest Songs in Country Music in 2003 and #87 on Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.  The song has also been featured in some video games: the original 1963 song was featured in Tony Hawk's Underground 2\, while a live version recorded in 1987 appeared in Guitar Hero 5 (which features a virtual avatar of Cash). The Social Distortion cover is a downloadable track for the Rock Band series (with the original song also confirmed for download in Rock Band 3) and is featured in Shaun White Snowboarding.  Blondie performed the song in the film Roadie (1980). The live recording was featured on the film soundtrack\, and on a reissue of the Blondie album Eat to the Beat.  It is heard briefly during a scene of the 2006 film Silent Hill. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

COL title VAL All My Loving COL performer VAL The Beatles	COL video title VAL Gene Vincent - For your Precious Love (Town Hall Party - 1958) COL description VAL Gene Vincent only had one really big hit\, "Be-Bop-a-Lula\," which epitomized rockabilly at its prime in 1956 with its sharp guitar breaks\, spare snare drums\, fluttering echo\, and Vincent's breathless\, sexy vocals. Yet his place as one of the great early rock & roll singers is secure\, backed up by a wealth of fine smaller hits and non-hits that rate among the best rockabilly of all time. The leather-clad\, limping\, greasy-haired singer was also one of rock's original bad boys\, lionized by romanticists of past and present generations attracted to his primitive\, sometimes savage style and indomitable spirit. Vincent was bucking the odds by entering professional music in the first place. As a 20-year-old in the Navy\, he suffered a severe motorcycle accident that almost resulted in the amputation of his leg\, and left him with a permanent limp and considerable chronic pain for the rest of his life. After the accident he began to concentrate on building a musical career\, playing with country bands around the Norfolk\, VA\, area. Demos cut at a local radio station\, fronting a band assembled around Gene by his management\, landed Gene Vincent & the Blue Caps a contract at Capitol\, which hoped they'd found competition for Elvis Presley. Indeed it had\, as by this time Vincent had plunged into all-out rockabilly\, capable of both fast-paced exuberance and whispery\, almost sensitive ballads. The Blue Caps were one of the greatest rock bands of the '50s\, anchored at first by the stunning silvery\, faster-than-light guitar leads of Cliff Gallup. The slap-back echo of "Be-Bop-a-Lula\," combined with Gene's swooping vocals\, led many to mistake the singer for Elvis when the record first hit the airwaves in mid-1956\, on its way to the Top Ten. The Elvis comparison wasn't entirely fair; Vincent had a gentler\, less melodramatic style\, capable of both whipping up a storm or winding down to a hush. Brilliant follow-ups like "Race With the Devil\," "Bluejean Bop\," and "B-I-Bickey\, Bi\, Bo-Bo-Go" failed to click in nearly as big a way\, although these too are emblematic of rockabilly at its most exuberant and powerful. By the end of 1956\, the Blue Caps were beginning to undergo the first of constant personnel changes that would continue throughout the '50s\, the most crucial loss being the departure of Gallup. The 35 or so tracks he cut with the band -- many of which showed up only on albums or b-sides -- were unquestionably Vincent's greatest work\, as his subsequent recordings would never again capture their pristine clarity and uninhibited spontaneity. Vincent had his second and final Top Twenty hit in 1957 with "Lotta Lovin'\," which reflected his increasingly tamer approach to production and vocals\, the wildness and live atmosphere toned down in favor of poppier material\, more subdued guitars\, and conventional-sounding backup singers. He recorded often for Capitol throughout the rest of the '50s\, and it's unfair to dismiss those sides out of hand; they were respectable\, occasionally exciting rockabilly\, only a marked disappointment in comparison with his earliest work. His act was captured for posterity in one of the best scenes of one of the first Hollywood films to feature rock & roll stars\, The Girl Can't Help It. Live\, Vincent continued to rock the house with reckless intensity and showmanship\, and he became particularly popular overseas. A 1960 tour of Britain\, though\, brought tragedy when his friend Eddie Cochran\, who shared the bill on Vincent's U.K. shows\, died in a car accident that he was also involved in\, though Vincent survived. By the early '60s\, his recordings had become much more sporadic and lower in quality\, and his chief audience was in Europe\, particularly in England (where he lived for a while) and France. His Capitol contract expired in 1963\, and he spent the rest of his life recording for several other labels\, none of which got him close to that comeback hit. Vincent never stopped trying to resurrect his career\, appearing at a 1969 Toronto rock festival on the same bill as John Lennon\, though his medical\, drinking\, and marital problems were making his life a mess\, and diminishing his stage presence as well. He died at the age of 36 from a ruptured stomach ulcer\, one of rock's first mythic figures. ~ Richie Unterberger\, Rovi  PLEASE NOTE:  I divided my uploads among multiple channels\,  Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

"After You've Gone" was recorded on their first session for the label and there seems to have been some growing pains. The balance is not as good as on the other labels\, with especially weak recording of the bass.  The opening chorus is by Grappelli this time around and he is immediately followed by the Louis Armstrong-inspired singing of Freddie Taylor. It seems that everyone is holding back in these opening choruses\, and sure enough\, as soon as Taylor is finished\, the intensity goes up as Django goes into a finger-busting chorus filled with fast arpeggios and runs\, and concluding with a chorded intro to Grappelli. The violinist takes charge\, building the intensity with every chorus. The breaks\, built into the tune at the end of each 16-bar section\, seem to have little effect on Taylor\, but each time Reinhardt and Grappelli hit them\, they add to the growing excitement of the recording.   1936 May 4 - Gramophone\, Paris COL channel name VAL Heinz Becker	0

The original line-up consisted of Brian Le Gassick – lead vocals\, guitar\, John Leach – lead guitar\, Willie van der Walt – bass and Ian Miller – drums. In 1962 Leach and van der Walt were replaced by Richard Crouse – guitar\, Jimmy Routledge – bass and Billy Andrews – vocals\, harmonica (Billy later became one half of the duo the “Dream Merchants” with Billy Forrest). In 1964 the Staccatos won the Transvaal Merseyside Contest\, which included a recording contract with EMI. They supported Peter and Gordon on their tour of South Africa in 1965.  In 1966 Steve Lonsdale took over the lead vocals\, and Richard Crouse married Wanda Arletti who joined the group for a tour of Zambia. In 1967 Eddie Boyle – bass\, and Ronnie Cline – organ\, joined the group. In 1968 Billy Forrest approached the group to record “Cry to me” for the film “Katrina”. This song became their biggest hit\, reaching number 1 on the South African Top 20 in 1969 and charting for a massive 38 weeks\, earning them a double gold disc.  In 1969 John Elliot – sax\, joined the group and in 1970 Ivor Black – drums and Peter Vee – lead vocals (Steve Lonsdale left for America).  This song is off the album “Hear And Now” released in 1968.

This is proven true\, given the fact that I recently discovered her albums—and I just haven't had my fill. I've searched and purchased everything I could find from such a gifted songstress. Lorez crafts each lyric with such grace and tonality that could easily match (if not surpass) the reigning jazz stylists of the bop/jazz/pop age. She gives each standard a new sense of evocative meaning as far as lyrics are concerned\, and reinvents the wheel each time she unleashes her enthralling voice. As she once said "A lyric is dead\, until you breathe life into it." This is exactly what she does. Enjoy and listen in HD\, to the lovely—Lorez Alexandria.

She worked for a while in mail order houses and in other mercantile establishments before trying her hand at show business. Her first experiences with the stage were without any particular distinction and to make something happen she entered a beauty contest and won it.  The contest was won in Canada and those in the Dominion to whom it mattered much were somewhat chagrined when her birthplace was revealed.  That didn't matter to Miss Morgan; all that mattered was that she'd had her first break.    By the early 1920s she had firmly established her reputation as a top-flight night-club singer\, both in America and abroad. In Europe\, at a Command Performance before the Duke of Windsor (then the Prince of Wales)\, a member of the Royal household approached her and warned her not to sing any vulgar songs.  She replied\, "If I did\, you'd have to teach them to me."  Returning to the States after that triumphant European jaunt\, Miss Morgan appeared in "Show Boat"\, the Ferber-Kern masterpiece which was to become her most successful and famous venture.   Until her untimely death at the age of forty-one\, Helen Morgan graced many Broadway shows\, radio programs and Hollywood films. COL channel name VAL bsgs98	0

COL title VAL Kansas City COL performer VAL Sandy Nelson	COL video title VAL Teddy Randazzo - Kiddio (Alan Freed's Mr. Rock and Roll) COL description VAL Teddy Randazzo was never quite as visible as other New York-spawned rock 'n' roll talent of the 1950's -- to name a few\, Dion was more of a star and for a lot longer\, and the various members of Jay & The Americans enjoyed hits right to the outset of the 1970's. But Randazzo had his day in the sun as a singer\, and he also wrote hundreds of songs\, and saw many dozens of recordings of the best of his work. Born in Brooklyn in 1937\, he was lucky enough to grow up in a musical family\, and by 15 was a good enough accordion player to turn professional\, as a member of the group the Three Chuckles\, who were in the market for a new keyboardman and singer -- the singing took a little time to develop\, with help from his decade-older fellow group members Tommy Romano and Russ Gilberto\, but when the group started recording\, it was the sides that Randazzo sang on that initially hit\, and by 1955\, at 17\, he was the frontman for the group. They had a number one hit with "And The Angels Sing"\, which had a rocking beat and brought them to the attention of deejay Alan Freed\, who put the group into his first jukebox movie\, Rock\, Rock\, Rock (shot in New York\, in the Bronx\, actually)\, but also gave Randazzo a solo spot.  When the smoke cleared from the movie\, Randazzo had decided to go solo. He continued recording for Vik Records\, a unit of RCA Victor\, and enjoyed a minor success in 1958 with "Little Serenade"\, and made an appearance in Freed's next movie\, Mister Rock And Roll\, as well as in the 20th Century-Fox CinemaScope color production The Girl Can't Help It\, among other movies. By 1960\, he'd moved to ABC-Paramount\, where he had another minor hit with "The Way Of A Clown"\, and in 1963 he had another small hit with "Big Wide World" on the Colpix label. But it was mostly as a songwriter and producer that Randazzo busied himself and made his real success in the music business; he wrote some 650 songs over the ensuing decades\, and saw them recorded by the likes of Frank Sinatra and Dionne Warwick. "Pretty Blue Eyes"\, authored with Bob Weinstein\, was a number one hit for Steve Lawrence. But it was with Little Anthony & The Imperials that he had his longest success -- in addition to producing the group\, he authored "Going Out Of My Head"\, "I'm On The Outside Looking In"\, and "Hurt So Bad" (later covered by Linda Ronstadt)\, among other hits.  Randazzo became less visible as the 1960's wore on\, and in the 1970's was largely forgotten by all except oldies fans. He remained active as a songwriter and behind-the-scenes\, and did the occasional live performance to keep his hand in\, but by then he was earning a good income from his annual royalties. He busied himself in local production in both Florida and Hawaii\, especially the latter\, and reportedly enjoyed a very happy second marriage -- his son from his first marriage\, Teddy Randazzo Jr.\, has also had a successful music career. Randazzo died in his sleep in 2003. ~ Bruce Eder\, All Music Guide  PLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels\, Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

COL title VAL What a Wonderful World COL performer VAL Sofie	COL video title VAL Halie Loren - What A Wonderful World COL description VAL Dedicated to children in every war-torn and oppressed part of Planet Earth.  I sincerely hope and pray that one day you will get to see the 'wonderful' side of this world.  ** Halie Loren - I love you and the way you revitalize the classics.  Thank you and wish you all the best in your career.  My gratitude to all the uploaders of the visuals used in this video.  ** Don't we all love the hope and optimism in this classic.  Obviously\, when it was written and recorded back in 1967\, the world was nothing like today\, even though it was at the height of Vietnam War.  Wouldn't you agree with me that in about 5 decades since\, this song should be reworked and re-titled as 'What A Horrible World.'  Fortunate are you who live in a very peaceful land away from the sight and sound of atrocity\, or if you have an option to not watch/read any news.  The original version by Louis Armstrong would still make sense and stay true.  I made this video two months ago and was waiting to upload.  In fact\, I didn't even want to upload it now\, or maybe ever\, because the words and content sound insincere\, faking\, and misleading.  Every one of my videos was inspired by someone or something.  This one was initially inspired by several hateful events that occurred to me.  It was made to comfort myself and to put some hope and optimism back in my heart.    Just as I was recovering\, the image of the lifeless body of a Syrian refugee boy (his name was Aylan Kurdi) on a Turkish beach reaffirmed how this song sounds more like an utter lie than just a simple empty and false promise of hope.  Please take it however you like.  If this video helps restore your optimism\, I am happy.  If it makes you feel worse\, you have my apologies.  As for me\, it hasn't made me feel better.  The news that the SAT scores are now at the lowest level in 10 years\, the fact that boss has just complained to me last night that kids nowadays can't even spell simple words while no one in the position of authority watches out for the future of these children make me sadder.  Worse\, looking around myself\, I see people keep escalating their pursuit of destruction of other people groups; some stir up more and more hatred based on religious beliefs.  I have to ask myself if I dare to believe that this world is a wonderful one.  As of now\, you don't want to know my answer.  ** No copyright infringement intended on video clips\, still photos\, and music. Made for entertainment purposes without financial gain.

Chloe by Plas Johnson\, a very popular saxophone player\,  from the 1959 Capitol stereo LP titled Mood For The Blues.   Plas John Johnson Jr. (born July 21\, 1931) is an American soul-jazz and hard bop tenor saxophonist\, probably most widely known as the tenor saxophone soloist on Henry Mancini's "The Pink Panther Theme".     Recruited by Capitol Records in the mid-1950s\, Johnson also played on innumerable records by Peggy Lee\, Nat "King" Cole\, Glen Gray\, Frank Sinatra and others. He remained a leading session player for almost twenty years\, averaging two sessions a day and playing everything from movie soundtracks to rock and roll singles\, by such artists as Ricky Nelson and Bobby Vee. He played on many of the Beach Boys' records\, and was an integral part of a number of instrumental groups that existed in name only\, such as B. Bumble and the Stingers. In the late 1950s and early 1960s he was a regular member of Henry Mancini's studio orchestra and in 1963 he recorded the Pink Panther theme. Another solo for a well-known television series was on The Odd Couple's theme music. Johnson was also used by Motown\, and played on hits by Marvin Gaye\, the Supremes and others.  Johnson can be heard on the 1963 album "Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Jerome Kern Songbook"\, recorded under the baton of the great Nelson Riddle. His sax is also heard on two of the other great Ella Fitzgerald songbooks - The Harold Arlen Songbook and The Johnny Mercer Songbook.  In 1964\, Johnson was the featured performer on "Blue Martini" ( Ava Records )\, a concept album by John Neel. It was a groundbreaking album\, with the saxophone being the lead "voice" surrounded by a full string section. This jazz/classical hybrid contains some of Johnson's best and most innovative playing\, with the standout being "Bury Me Blue".  In 1970\, he joined the studio band for "The Merv Griffin Show" and also played with a number of jazz and swing bands of the period. He continues to record and perform\, particularly at jazz festivals.  Johnson currently performs on T990 (brass) and T9937 (solid silver) tenor saxophones made by Yanagisawa. He uses a very open (140/2) Berg Larsen stainless steel mouthpiece with Rico Plasticover no. 2 reeds\, a setup that enables him to produce his very di COL channel name VAL maynardcat	0

COL title VAL Child in Time COL performer VAL Quidam [1]	COL video title VAL Teddy Randazzo - Kiddio (Alan Freed's Mr. Rock and Roll) COL description VAL Teddy Randazzo was never quite as visible as other New York-spawned rock 'n' roll talent of the 1950's -- to name a few\, Dion was more of a star and for a lot longer\, and the various members of Jay & The Americans enjoyed hits right to the outset of the 1970's. But Randazzo had his day in the sun as a singer\, and he also wrote hundreds of songs\, and saw many dozens of recordings of the best of his work. Born in Brooklyn in 1937\, he was lucky enough to grow up in a musical family\, and by 15 was a good enough accordion player to turn professional\, as a member of the group the Three Chuckles\, who were in the market for a new keyboardman and singer -- the singing took a little time to develop\, with help from his decade-older fellow group members Tommy Romano and Russ Gilberto\, but when the group started recording\, it was the sides that Randazzo sang on that initially hit\, and by 1955\, at 17\, he was the frontman for the group. They had a number one hit with "And The Angels Sing"\, which had a rocking beat and brought them to the attention of deejay Alan Freed\, who put the group into his first jukebox movie\, Rock\, Rock\, Rock (shot in New York\, in the Bronx\, actually)\, but also gave Randazzo a solo spot.  When the smoke cleared from the movie\, Randazzo had decided to go solo. He continued recording for Vik Records\, a unit of RCA Victor\, and enjoyed a minor success in 1958 with "Little Serenade"\, and made an appearance in Freed's next movie\, Mister Rock And Roll\, as well as in the 20th Century-Fox CinemaScope color production The Girl Can't Help It\, among other movies. By 1960\, he'd moved to ABC-Paramount\, where he had another minor hit with "The Way Of A Clown"\, and in 1963 he had another small hit with "Big Wide World" on the Colpix label. But it was mostly as a songwriter and producer that Randazzo busied himself and made his real success in the music business; he wrote some 650 songs over the ensuing decades\, and saw them recorded by the likes of Frank Sinatra and Dionne Warwick. "Pretty Blue Eyes"\, authored with Bob Weinstein\, was a number one hit for Steve Lawrence. But it was with Little Anthony & The Imperials that he had his longest success -- in addition to producing the group\, he authored "Going Out Of My Head"\, "I'm On The Outside Looking In"\, and "Hurt So Bad" (later covered by Linda Ronstadt)\, among other hits.  Randazzo became less visible as the 1960's wore on\, and in the 1970's was largely forgotten by all except oldies fans. He remained active as a songwriter and behind-the-scenes\, and did the occasional live performance to keep his hand in\, but by then he was earning a good income from his annual royalties. He busied himself in local production in both Florida and Hawaii\, especially the latter\, and reportedly enjoyed a very happy second marriage -- his son from his first marriage\, Teddy Randazzo Jr.\, has also had a successful music career. Randazzo died in his sleep in 2003. ~ Bruce Eder\, All Music Guide  PLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels\, Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

These images are gritty and real. Sometimes history repeats itself\, but hopefully the worst is behind us. Although "Hard Times Come Again No More" sounds as if it were written during the Great Depression\, it was actually written in 1854 by Stephen C. Foster\, America's pioneer songwriter. Mavis Staples\, one of the greatest living gospel and R&B singers\, recorded the song as part of  the CD "Beautiful Dreamer - The Songs of Stephen Foster"  a tribute album released on the Emergent Music label in 2004. Included are many of his famous and some lesser known songs recorded with contemporary interpretations and arrangements. I do not own the right to the song\, audio\, or images contained in this video. The sound recording is administered by SME.  No copyright infringement is intended.

COL title VAL Somebody to Love [Queen Cover] COL performer VAL Glee Cast	COL video title VAL The Charlie Daniels Band - Back In The Saddle Again.wmv COL description VAL By the Light of the Moon - Campfire Songs (1997) In the 1970s\, fiddler Charlie Daniels was one of the few almost completely country-leaning artists to make a play on the mainstream rock market. He did splendidly for a while\, and the production values he learned playing in rock-inflected settings show clearly on his first kids recording. By the Light of the Moon is most surely a country recording\, but it has all the driving rhythmic energy of an elegantly mastered rock album. The drums sound fat and still crisp\, the guitars bright. Daniels's voice\, especially during the interludes where he speaks about the music\, reveals a timeworn huskiness that will charm kids looking for a cowboy to sing to them. The songs emphasize the old\, with "John Henry" and "I'm an Old Cowhand" standing out. The latter includes Daniels playing short fiddle solos that cut a nice\, fresh path through the tune. A sonically splashy session indeed\, By the Light of the Moon has enough old-timey vibrance to merit a spot in any roots-oriented kids collection.  Song Title    1. Get Along\, Little Dogies 3:26  2. Cowboy Logic 4:33  3. I'm an Old Cowhand (from the Rio Grande) 3:32  4. Old Chisholm Trail 4:47  5. Sixteen Tons 2:58  6. Back in the Saddle Again 3:11  7. John Henry 3:56  8. Top Hand 4:04  9.

This was her 10th LP in just 15 years as a professional singer. If I Give My Heart To You was a US Top 5 hit in 1954 for Doris Day. DANA's (superior) version made #27 in Ireland. She wrote in her autobiography about the time she first saw Doris Day in America in 1970: "But the greatest highlight for me was when I saw Doris Day in person. She came to our hotel for lunch\, on her bike\, dressed in a pair of cut-off cotton trousers and a T-shirt\, with her blond hair pulled back in a pony tail."  If I give my heart to you Will you handle it with care Will you promise you'll be true to me And in every way be fair  If I give my heart to you Will you give me all your love Will you always treat me tenderly Swear by stars that shine above  And will you sigh with me when I'm sad And smile with me when I'm glad And always be as you are with me tonight  Think it over and be sure Please don't answer till you do When you promise all these things to me Then I'll give my heart to you  Think it over and be sure Please don't answer till you do When you promise all these things to me Then I'll give my heart to you  If you promise all these things to me Then I'll give my heart to you  Words and music by Jimmy Brewster\, Jimmie Crane and Al Jacobs.

Yeah but Baby I've been here before I've seen this room and I've walked this floor\, (You know) I used to live alone before I knew ya And I've seen your flag on the marble arch and love is not a victory march It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah  Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah...  Well there was a time when you let me know What's really going on below But now you never show that to me do ya But remember when I moved in you And the holy dove was moving too And every breath we drew was Hallelujah  Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah  Hallelujah...  Maybe there's a God above But all I've ever learned from love Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya And it's not a cry that you hear at night It's not somebody who's seen the light It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah  Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelu...

Also\, a DVD called 'Bryn Terfel Live @ The Amsterdam Concertgebouw (2003)' you may find this part.  Enjoy!  (1945) Richard Rodgers\, Oscar Hammerstein II   The things I used to like I don't like anymore.  I want a lot of other things  I've never had before. It's just like mother says... I sit around and mope. Pretending I am wonderful. And knowing I'm a dope.  I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm\, I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string. I'd say that I had spring fever\, But I know it isn't spring.  I'm starry-eyed and vaguely discontented Like a nightingale without a song to sing. Oh\, why should I have spring fever When it isn't even spring?  I keep wishing I were somewhere else\,  Walking down a strange new street. Hearing words that I have never heard From a girl\, I've yet to meet.  I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams\, I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing. I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud Or a robin on the wing.  But I feel so gay\, In a melancholy way\, That it might as well be spring\,  It might as well be spring. COL channel name VAL J.

COL title VAL You're the Top COL performer VAL Stacey Kent	COL video title VAL Hal Kemp Skinnay Ennis - You're the Top 1934 - Cole Porter COL description VAL "You're The Top" is a Cole Porter song from the 1934 musical Anything Goes. It is about a man and a woman who take turns complimenting each other. The best selling version was Paul Whiteman's Victor single\, which made the top five. It was the most popular song from Anything Goes at the start with hundreds of parodies. The lyrics are particularly significant because they offer a snapshot as to what was highly prized in the mid-1930s\, and demonstrate Porter's rhyming ability Hal Kemp (March 27\, 1904 -- December 21\, 1940) was a jazz alto saxophonist\, clarinetist\, bandleader\, composer\, and arranger. He was born in Marion\, Alabama and died in Madera\, California following an auto accident. Art Jarrett took on leadership of Kemp's orchestra in 1941. His major recordings were "There's a Small Hotel"\, "Where or When"\, "This Year's Kisses"\, "When I'm With You"\, "Got a Date With an Angel" and "Three Little Fishies". On December 19\, 1940\, while driving from Los Angeles to a booking in San Francisco\, his car collided head-on with another. Kemp broke a leg and several ribs and suffered a punctured lung. He developed pneumonia while in the hospital and died two days later. Edgar Clyde "Skinnay" Ennis\, Jr. (August 13\, 1907 - June 3\, 1963) was an American jazz and pop music bandleader and singer. Ennis was born in Salisbury\, North Carolina and met Hal Kemp while attending the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill. He joined Kemp's orchestra as a drummer and vocalist in the late 1920s\, playing with him through 1937 including one tour of Europe in 1930. Following this Ennis put together his own band\, which became a popular ensemble in Hollywood films. "Got a Date With an Angel" was his theme song. During this time Gil Evans was one of his arrangers. He also did comedy routines\, and landed a job on Bob Hope's radio program from 1938 through 1946. He conducted his own service band during World War II and returned to Hollywood bandleading at the war's end. Toward the end of the 1950s Ennis's career had faded\, and he worked mostly in hotels in the Los Angeles area. He choked to death on a bone while eating dinner at a restaurant in Beverly Hills in 1963. COL channel name VAL warholsoup100	1

If you go away As I know you will You must tell the world To stop turning 'til you return again If you ever do For what good is love Without loving you?

Born Anita Belle Colton\, O'Day was admired for her sense of rhythm and dynamics\, and her early big band appearances shattered the traditional image of the "girl singer". Refusing to pander to any female stereotype\, O'Day presented herself as a "hip" jazz musician\, wearing a band jacket and skirt as opposed to an evening gown. She changed her surname from Colton to O'Day\, pig Latin for "dough\," slang for money. COL channel name VAL Music Legends Book	1

Available in physical form direct from website http://HistoryofRnB.net   Download from   Amazon http://www.amazon.co.uk/Those-Hoodlum-Friends-Coasters-Stereo/dp/B00BR0QU6A/ref=dm_cd_album_lnk  iTunes https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/those-hoodlum-friends-coasters/id609884465    Stream from Spotify http://open.spotify.com/album/6IDmQkLUjCQe6poBO4izrg   The Coasters had the benefit of recording in the best studios\, backed by the best musicians and produced by the top producers of their generation\, Leiber and Stoller. Naturally\, they were required to run through as many takes of each song as was necessary to satisfy the exacting demands of their mentors. Luckily for us\, many of these alternate takes have survived. Mono was the standard recording format until the late 1960s\, but many of the big selling artists also recorded alternate versions specifically for the stereo market\, which was targeted to the discerning adult listener.     Disc One features all the alternate stereo versions of Coasters songs that were issued at the time on album and subsequently on CD. Disc Two takes you deep into the heart of Coasters sessions with composite tracks which combine studio chatter together with the finest moments from various different takes. This disc contains several outtakes which have until now been unavailable anywhere and gives an invaluable insight into the genesis of many well-loved tracks and also into the character and working practice of the Coasters and of their producers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller.     The accompanying 24-page booklet includes many rare photos and an exhaustive session discography by Claus Röhnisch. A collection for Coasters and early rock 'n' roll aficionados!

COL title VAL Old Time Religion COL performer VAL Jackie Wilson and Linda Hopkins	COL video title VAL The Beau Brummels\, Play With Fire (Rolling Stones cover) COL description VAL Beau Brummels '66 is the third studio album by American rock group The Beau Brummels\, and their first on Warner Bros. Records. The album consists of twelve cover songs and no originals. Autumn Records\, the band's previous label\, had sold the band to Warner Brothers in early 1966. Warner Brothers\, however\, did not control the publishing rights\, and opted to have the band record an album of covers\, including songs originally performed by Richard Berry\, Rolling Stones\, The Beatles and Bob Dylan\, as well as recent hit singles by such acts as The Mamas & the Papas and Simon & Garfunkel. Lead vocalist Sal Valentino explained\, "When we went to Warner Brothers\, they were just anxious to get a record out\, to capitalize on the success we had. That record was the wrong one to do at the time.  The album features Don Irving on guitar. Irving briefly became a member of the Beau Brummels filling in for Ron Elliott\, who also played on the album\, but was unable to withstand the rigors of touring due to his diabetic condition.

"Aquarela do Brasil"\, as the song was titled originally by Barroso\, had a "difficult start" in the early years after its release and it was only in 1942 that the composition became a worldwide success after.........having appeared in Walt Disney's animation movie "Saludos Amigos".  With its popularity climbing to unseen 'heights' in the US\, soon English lyrics had to be added and songwriter Bob Russell got the 'job'.  Recently\, in 2009\, the 1942 version of "Brazil" by Jimmy Dorsey and his Orchestra was added to the Grammy Hall of Fame by the GA Academy.   Here Gordon Franks and his fabulous orchestra bring us ( at least that's what we think )- one of the best arrangements "ever" of this evergreen. From the 1967 album "Orchestral in the Night" here are Gordon Franks and His Orchestra taking you on a musical trip to .... Brazil !  Enjoy. COL channel name VAL Socratess2007	0

Clifford\, Kelleher\, O'Neill\, Yeates; (c) 1994 Four to the Bar  LYRICS Her eyes they shone like diamonds I thought her the queen of the land And her hair it hung over her shoulder Tied up with an black velvet band  In a neat little town they call Belfast apprentice to trade I was bound And many an hour of sweet happiness have I spent in that neat little town A sad misfortune came over me which caused me to stray from the land Far away from my friends and relations betrayed by the black velvet band  I took a stroll down Broadway meaning not long for to stay When whom should I meet but this pretty fair maid come a-traipsing along the highway She was both fair and handsome\, her neck it was just like a swan And her hair it hung over her shoulder tied up with a black velvet band  I took a stroll with this pretty fair maid\, and a gentleman passing us by I knew she meant the doing of him by the look in her roguish black eye A gold watch she took from his pocket and placed it right into my hand And the very first thing that I said was\, Bad cess to the black velvet band  Before the judge and the jury next morning I had to appear The judge he says to me\, Young man\, your case it is proven clear We'll give you seven years penal servitude to be spent far away from the land Far away from your friends and relations\, betrayed by the black velvet band  So come all ye jolly young fellows\, a warning take by me When you're out on the town me lads\, beware of the pretty colleens They'll feed you with strong drink me lads\, till you are unable to stand And the very first thing that you know is\, you've landed in Van Diemen's Land  I've been a wild rover for manys the year\, And I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer\, But now I'm returning with gold in great store\, And I never will play the wild rover no more.  And it's No\, Nay\, Never\,  No\, Nay\, Never\, No more\, Will I play the wild rover\, No\, never\, No more.  I went into an alehouse I used to frequent\, And I told the landlady my money was spent\, I asked her for credit\, she answered me Nay\, Such custom as yours I could have every day.  I brought up from my pockets 10 sovereigns bright\, And the landlady's eyes lit up with delight\, She said I have whiskey and wines of the best\, And the words that I told you were only in jest.  I¹ll go home to my parents\, confess what I¹ve done\, And I¹ll ask them to pardon their prodigal son. And when they¹ve caressed me as oft times before\, I never will play the wild rover no more.  At Orenmore in the County Galway\, One pleasant evening in the month of May\, I spied a damsel\, she was young and handsome Her beauty fairly took my breath away.  She wore no jewels\, nor costly diamonds\, No paint or powder\, no\, none at all. But she wore a bonnet with a ribbon on it And round her shoulder was a Galway Shawl.  We kept on walking\, she kept on talking\, 'Till her father's cottage came into view. Says she: 'Come in\, sir\, and meet my father\, And play to please him " The Foggy Dew."  She sat me down beside the fire I could see her father\, he was six feet tall. And soon her mother had the kettle singing All I could think of was the Galway shawl.  I played "The Blackbird" and "The Stack of Barley"\, " Rodney's Glory" and "The Foggy Dew"\, She sang each note like an Irish linnet. Whilst the tears stood in her eyes of blue.  'Twas early\, early\, all in the morning\, When I hit the road for old Donegal. She said 'Goodby\, sir\,'she cried and kissed me\, And my heart remained with that Galway shawl.

She worked for a while in mail order houses and in other mercantile establishments before trying her hand at show business. Her first experiences with the stage were without any particular distinction and to make something happen she entered a beauty contest and won it.  The contest was won in Canada and those in the Dominion to whom it mattered much were somewhat chagrined when her birthplace was revealed.  That didn't matter to Miss Morgan; all that mattered was that she'd had her first break.    By the early 1920s she had firmly established her reputation as a top-flight night-club singer\, both in America and abroad. In Europe\, at a Command Performance before the Duke of Windsor (then the Prince of Wales)\, a member of the Royal household approached her and warned her not to sing any vulgar songs.  She replied\, "If I did\, you'd have to teach them to me."  Returning to the States after that triumphant European jaunt\, Miss Morgan appeared in "Show Boat"\, the Ferber-Kern masterpiece which was to become her most successful and famous venture.   Until her untimely death at the age of forty-one\, Helen Morgan graced many Broadway shows\, radio programs and Hollywood films. COL channel name VAL bsgs98	0

This was her 10th LP in just 15 years as a professional singer. If I Give My Heart To You was a US Top 5 hit in 1954 for Doris Day. DANA's (superior) version made #27 in Ireland. She wrote in her autobiography about the time she first saw Doris Day in America in 1970: "But the greatest highlight for me was when I saw Doris Day in person. She came to our hotel for lunch\, on her bike\, dressed in a pair of cut-off cotton trousers and a T-shirt\, with her blond hair pulled back in a pony tail."  If I give my heart to you Will you handle it with care Will you promise you'll be true to me And in every way be fair  If I give my heart to you Will you give me all your love Will you always treat me tenderly Swear by stars that shine above  And will you sigh with me when I'm sad And smile with me when I'm glad And always be as you are with me tonight  Think it over and be sure Please don't answer till you do When you promise all these things to me Then I'll give my heart to you  Think it over and be sure Please don't answer till you do When you promise all these things to me Then I'll give my heart to you  If you promise all these things to me Then I'll give my heart to you  Words and music by Jimmy Brewster\, Jimmie Crane and Al Jacobs.

She was signed to a long-term contract with the soft-drink company to sing all television and radio commercials\, do all magazine and billboard advertising representing them in every capacity\, sometimes sharing the spotlight with American Bandstand's Dick Clark.

Later\, she became the regular female vocalist on the popular 60's American live rock n roll TV show "Shindig" and she appeared in singing and acting roles in many iconic TV shows like Batman\, The Monkees\, Gomer Pyle\, The Mothers-In-Law\, Red Skelton\, Milton Berle and various game shows.

It was released on 1 July 1977 as the third single and was later featured on their only album\, Never Mind the Bollocks\, Here's the Sex Pistols\, released that same year. The song marked the band's (then) only appearance on the British music show Top of the Pops\, until 1996 when the original line-up performed the song (after the live version was released that year) as well as "New York" on the same showing. The song is infamous for vocalist John Lydon's phrasing of the word "vacant"\, emphasising the last syllable making it sound like the vulgar word "cunt". According to Glen Matlock the riff was inspired by "S.O.S." by ABBA after hearing it on the radio. The B-side is a cover of The Stooges' "No Fun" which they played on the spot without a proper rehearsal. No Fun was taken from demo sessions recorded by producer Dave Goodman.  The band made a video of Pretty Vacant for Top Of The Pops (as well as God Save The Queen) on 11 & 12 July 1977 at the studios of ITN in Wells St\, London. They were thrown out after throwing cans of lager at the cameramen on the 11th but came back on the 12th to finish the recording.  NME magazine made it their Single of the Year in 1977. In March 2005\, Q magazine placed the song at number 26 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks.  The album was reissued as a 2CD set in 1992. A live version of the track from Filthy Lucre Live was released as a single in 1996\, and a 7" picture disc was released in 2012.  Covers and samples  Joey Ramone used the lead riff in his cover of "What a Wonderful World".  South African pop group Shikisha released a cover version of the song in 1996.  The French band Les Négresses Vertes as well as grime MC Lady Sovereign have both covered "Pretty Vacant" and performed live versions of the song. Lady Sovereign's version is featured in the popular TV show\, The O.C. and the cover version is featured on one of the six The O.C. soundtracks called Music from The O.C.: Mix 6 -- Covering Our Tracks.  Joan Jett released a cover version on single.  In 1996 Black Grape released cover version (very similiar to an original) on their single "Fat Neck".  An Irish language version of the song\, entitled "Folamh go Deas" (a literal translation)\, was performed by Irish band Na Magairlí in 1981.  The group The Ukrainians perform a Ukrainian language version of this song on their EP Anarchy In The UK and album Respublika. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

Ar Log\, one of the best Welsh Folk Groups recorded this very beautiful lovesong. Y Deryn Pur (The Gentle Dove)  Y deryn pur â'r adain las Bydd i mi'n was dibrydar O! brysur brysia at y ferch Lle rhois i'm serch yn gynnar Dos di ati\, dywed wrthi Mod i'n wylo'r dwr yn heli Mod i'n irad am ei gwelad Ac o'i chariad yn ffaelu â cherddad\, O! Duw faddeuo'r hardd ei llun Am boeni dyn mor galad!  Pan o'wn yn hoenus iawn fy hwyl Ddiwrnod gwyl yn gwylio Canfyddwn fenyw lana' rioed Ar ysgafn droed yn rhodio. Pan y'i gwelais syth mi sefais Yn fy nghalon mi feddyliais Wele ddynes lana'r deyrnas A'i gwên yn harddu'r oll o'i chwmpas Ni fynnwn gredu un dyn byw Nad oedd hi ryw angyles!   English  O gentle dove with wings so blue Fly quickly to my lady And take to her a message true While in her garden shady Go to her and say I love her And am trying to discover How to meet her\, fondly greet her But if my love should fail to please her May God forgive her beautiful face I know that I must leave her.  With heart so gay one happy day I walked with step so sprightly The loveliest girl I'd ever seen Came tripping there so lightly On her beauty so amazing I could only stand there gazing Of the fairest\, she the rarest Her smile make all around her shining She was an angel to my eyes And for her love I'm pining.

COL title VAL Good Rockin' Tonight COL performer VAL Curley Bridges	COL video title VAL The David Rose Orchestra -   Happy Heart COL description VAL "Knowing a person is like music. What attracts us is their melody and as we get to know who they are\, we learn their lyrics." ( Unknown) ▼▼▼  DAVID ROSE Recipient of four Emmy awards\, Rose was born in London\, to Jewish parents\, and raised in Chicago\, Illinois. Rose's career in music began when he worked with Ted Fio Rito's band when he was sixteen. Rose also worked as a standby pianist for NBC Radio. It was here\, in the early 1930s\, that he first gained a reputation\, while arranging for the Frank Trumbauer orchestra and later leading a house band at station WGN. He composed several early swing originals such as "Break It Down" with Frankie Trumbauer\, "Transcontinental\," "Plantation Moods\," and a piece recorded under three different titles: "I've Got It"\, "Itchola"\, and "Jigsaw Rhythm\," his original version with the WGN band including Louis Prima. Rose was asked to come to Hollywood\, where he formed his orchestra\, doing a twice-weekly radio show for Mutual Broadcasting System called California Melodies\, where he wrote all the broadcast arrangements. He worked his way up to becoming music director of the Mutual network.  Rose's first try at composing was his hit song "Holiday for Strings". During World War II\, Rose entered the Army and it was here where he met Red Skelton. Skelton asked Rose to become the conductor for his Raleigh Cigarettes Program. Rose joined the cast in 1948 and went on to work with Skelton on his television show for over 20 years. "Holiday for Strings" became well known as the theme for Red Skelton's programs. A parody version\, retitled "Holiday for States"\, was recorded as a vocal by Allan Sherman\, with the straight melody but with ersatz lyrics consisting solely of the names of the American states. Rose also was the composer of some famous TV themes such as "Bonanza" and "Little House on the Prairie".  He recorded more than 30 easy listening albums during his career which span nearly 50 years.  HAPPY HEART "Happy Heart" is a song written by James Last and Jackie Rae. The song was recorded by both Petula Clark and Andy Williams and released as a single for each at the same time in 1969. "Happy Heart" reached #12 on the Easy Listening chart and #62 in the UK for Clark\, while Williams went to #22 on the 'Billboard Hot 100\, #19 in the UK\, and spent two weeks at #1 on the Easy Listening charts.  MHO A superb arrangement of James Last's "classic theme" with a most original intro and dito ending.  The skill of David Rose as an arranger is highlighted here as he adds "minor" musical details to the score\, thus lifting the song to an even higher level.  I especially like the "conversations" between the base and the brass - the small pauses\, together with the majestic refrain parts definitely turn my heart into a "happy one" ;-) ! Enjoy !

Fängt sie dich mit den Augen  und trinkt dich langsam leer sie spielt schon so perfekt\,  als ob sie Bette Davis wär.  Oh sie liebt dich\, sie besiegt dich kennt dich übermorgen doch nicht. Ganz unschuldig lacht sie und zählt dich aus oh du kennst die Tricks nicht. Ihr zu widerstehen fällt dir schwer als ob sie Bette Davis wär.  Sie nimmt dich mit nach Haus und ihrem Garbo-Charme läufst du blind hinterher  als ob sie Bette Davis wär. Sie macht den Clown aus dir zwingt dich auf die Knie. Sie macht das ganz leger  als ob sie Bette Davis wär.  Oh sie liebt dich\, sie besiegt dich kennt dich übermorgen doch nicht. Ganz unschuldig lacht sie und zählt dich aus oh du kennst die Tricks nicht. Ihr zu widerstehen fällt dir schwer als ob sie Bette Davis wär.  (Instrumental)  Oh sie liebt dich\, sie besiegt dich kennt dich übermorgen doch nicht. Ganz unschuldig lacht sie und zählt dich aus oh du kennst die Tricks nicht.

COL title VAL Little White Lies COL performer VAL Diane Renay Arr. & Cond. by Pete DeAngelis	COL video title VAL Crazy Otto -- Little White Lies (Swing Honky Tonk) COL description VAL Crazy Otto. Fritz Schulz-Reichel\, nacido en 1912. Hijo de un músico de escuela clásica\, aprendió a tocar el piano a los seis años\, y dos años después sorprendió al desarrollar un particular estilo de ejecutar\, marcando el ritmo con su mano derecha mientras la melodía la interpretaba con la izquierda. En contra de los deseos paternos\, dejó la música clásica para dedicarse al Jazz y la improvisación sobre melodías populares.  Su popularidad se extendió por Europa\, especialmente por Inglaterra y Francia\, donde fue nombrado miembro honorario del Hot Club of France. Después de la Segunda Guerra Mundial triunfó en USA\, a partir del éxito de Johnny Maddox\, que llevó al segundo lugar de los charts "The Crazy Otto Medley" en 1955.  El interés por Otto hizo que grabara varios LP en Decca\, y que se creara el sello "Crazy Otto Music"\, dedicado a las grabaciones de Maddox y otros músicos de ragtime. Crazy Otto falleció en 1990.

It was produced and directed by Frank Tashlin\, with a screenplay adapted by Tashlin and Herbert Baker from an uncredited novel Do Re Me by Garson Kanin. The movie was originally intended as a vehicle for the American sex symbol Jayne Mansfield\, with a satirical subplot involving teenagers and rock 'n' roll music. The unintended result has been called the "most potent" celebration of rock music ever captured on film.[3] The original music score\, including a title song performed by Little Richard\, was by Bobby Troup\, with an additional credit to Ray Anthony for the tune "Big Band Boogie". It was shot in DeLuxe Color\, filmed in CinemaScope\, and runs 99 minutes. COL channel name VAL AtoZofRockandRoll	0

(1945) Richard Rodgers\, Oscar Hammerstein II   The things I used to like I don't like anymore.  I want a lot of other things  I've never had before. It's just like mother says... I sit around and mope. Pretending I am wonderful. And knowing I'm a dope.  I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm\, I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string. I'd say that I had spring fever\, But I know it isn't spring.  I'm starry-eyed and vaguely discontented Like a nightingale without a song to sing. Oh\, why should I have spring fever When it isn't even spring?  I keep wishing I were somewhere else\,  Walking down a strange new street. Hearing words that I have never heard From a girl\, I've yet to meet.  I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams\, I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing. I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud Or a robin on the wing.  But I feel so gay\, In a melancholy way\, That it might as well be spring\,  It might as well be spring. COL channel name VAL J.

Recorded on September 17\, 1952 at Columbia's Thirtieth St. studio in New York City\, and arranged and conducted by Percy Faith\, it was released as a 78 and 45 R.P.M single. It can be found on CD on The Voice - The Columbia Years 1943-1952 and The Columbia Years 1943 - 1952 The Complete Recordings.  Recorded at a low point in his career\, it perfectly captures his emotions at the time.  Sinatra had been under a great deal of pressure from Mitch Miller\, the head of Columbia's Artists and Repertoire Division to record material that Sinatra considered inappropriate\, resulting in his departure from Columbia. This gem was Sinatra's parting shot. He was to record it again in 1959 with Gordon Jenkins for the No One Cares LP on Capitol.

COL title VAL Portrait of Jenny COL performer VAL Clifford Brown	COL video title VAL The David Rose Orchestra -   Happy Heart COL description VAL "Knowing a person is like music. What attracts us is their melody and as we get to know who they are\, we learn their lyrics." ( Unknown) ▼▼▼  DAVID ROSE Recipient of four Emmy awards\, Rose was born in London\, to Jewish parents\, and raised in Chicago\, Illinois. Rose's career in music began when he worked with Ted Fio Rito's band when he was sixteen. Rose also worked as a standby pianist for NBC Radio. It was here\, in the early 1930s\, that he first gained a reputation\, while arranging for the Frank Trumbauer orchestra and later leading a house band at station WGN. He composed several early swing originals such as "Break It Down" with Frankie Trumbauer\, "Transcontinental\," "Plantation Moods\," and a piece recorded under three different titles: "I've Got It"\, "Itchola"\, and "Jigsaw Rhythm\," his original version with the WGN band including Louis Prima. Rose was asked to come to Hollywood\, where he formed his orchestra\, doing a twice-weekly radio show for Mutual Broadcasting System called California Melodies\, where he wrote all the broadcast arrangements. He worked his way up to becoming music director of the Mutual network.  Rose's first try at composing was his hit song "Holiday for Strings". During World War II\, Rose entered the Army and it was here where he met Red Skelton. Skelton asked Rose to become the conductor for his Raleigh Cigarettes Program. Rose joined the cast in 1948 and went on to work with Skelton on his television show for over 20 years. "Holiday for Strings" became well known as the theme for Red Skelton's programs. A parody version\, retitled "Holiday for States"\, was recorded as a vocal by Allan Sherman\, with the straight melody but with ersatz lyrics consisting solely of the names of the American states. Rose also was the composer of some famous TV themes such as "Bonanza" and "Little House on the Prairie".  He recorded more than 30 easy listening albums during his career which span nearly 50 years.  HAPPY HEART "Happy Heart" is a song written by James Last and Jackie Rae. The song was recorded by both Petula Clark and Andy Williams and released as a single for each at the same time in 1969. "Happy Heart" reached #12 on the Easy Listening chart and #62 in the UK for Clark\, while Williams went to #22 on the 'Billboard Hot 100\, #19 in the UK\, and spent two weeks at #1 on the Easy Listening charts.  MHO A superb arrangement of James Last's "classic theme" with a most original intro and dito ending.  The skill of David Rose as an arranger is highlighted here as he adds "minor" musical details to the score\, thus lifting the song to an even higher level.  I especially like the "conversations" between the base and the brass - the small pauses\, together with the majestic refrain parts definitely turn my heart into a "happy one" ;-) ! Enjoy !

COL title VAL Sunshine Superman COL performer VAL Sugarman Three	COL video title VAL Freddie Taylor & Django Reinhardt - After You've Gone - 1936 May 4 - Gramophone\, Paris COL description VAL Django Reinhardt et le Quintette du Hot Club de France\, avec Stéphane Grappelli  Stéphane Grappelli (v);  Django Reinhardt (g solo);  Joseph Reinhardt\, Pierre "Baro" Ferret (g);  Lucien Simoens (b);  Freddy Taylor (vo)   After its initial recordings on Ultraphone and Decca\, the QHCF moved to the HMV label.  "After You've Gone" was recorded on their first session for the label and there seems to have been some growing pains. The balance is not as good as on the other labels\, with especially weak recording of the bass.  The opening chorus is by Grappelli this time around and he is immediately followed by the Louis Armstrong-inspired singing of Freddie Taylor. It seems that everyone is holding back in these opening choruses\, and sure enough\, as soon as Taylor is finished\, the intensity goes up as Django goes into a finger-busting chorus filled with fast arpeggios and runs\, and concluding with a chorded intro to Grappelli. The violinist takes charge\, building the intensity with every chorus. The breaks\, built into the tune at the end of each 16-bar section\, seem to have little effect on Taylor\, but each time Reinhardt and Grappelli hit them\, they add to the growing excitement of the recording.   1936 May 4 - Gramophone\, Paris COL channel name VAL Heinz Becker	0

Yeah but Baby I've been here before I've seen this room and I've walked this floor\, (You know) I used to live alone before I knew ya And I've seen your flag on the marble arch and love is not a victory march It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah  Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah...  Well there was a time when you let me know What's really going on below But now you never show that to me do ya But remember when I moved in you And the holy dove was moving too And every breath we drew was Hallelujah  Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah  Hallelujah...  Maybe there's a God above But all I've ever learned from love Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya And it's not a cry that you hear at night It's not somebody who's seen the light It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah  Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelu...

Available in physical form direct from website http://HistoryofRnB.net   Download from   Amazon http://www.amazon.co.uk/Those-Hoodlum-Friends-Coasters-Stereo/dp/B00BR0QU6A/ref=dm_cd_album_lnk  iTunes https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/those-hoodlum-friends-coasters/id609884465    Stream from Spotify http://open.spotify.com/album/6IDmQkLUjCQe6poBO4izrg   The Coasters had the benefit of recording in the best studios\, backed by the best musicians and produced by the top producers of their generation\, Leiber and Stoller. Naturally\, they were required to run through as many takes of each song as was necessary to satisfy the exacting demands of their mentors. Luckily for us\, many of these alternate takes have survived. Mono was the standard recording format until the late 1960s\, but many of the big selling artists also recorded alternate versions specifically for the stereo market\, which was targeted to the discerning adult listener.     Disc One features all the alternate stereo versions of Coasters songs that were issued at the time on album and subsequently on CD. Disc Two takes you deep into the heart of Coasters sessions with composite tracks which combine studio chatter together with the finest moments from various different takes. This disc contains several outtakes which have until now been unavailable anywhere and gives an invaluable insight into the genesis of many well-loved tracks and also into the character and working practice of the Coasters and of their producers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller.     The accompanying 24-page booklet includes many rare photos and an exhaustive session discography by Claus Röhnisch. A collection for Coasters and early rock 'n' roll aficionados!

He was not only one of the most popular musicians to come out of the West Coast's "cool jazz" scene\, but also the possessor of a legendary and idiosyncratic wit. In addition to his work with Brubeck he led several of his own groups and did significant collaborations with artists such as Gerry Mulligan\, Jim Hall and Chet Baker. After years of chain smoking and general poor health\, Desmond succumbed to lung cancer in 1977 following one last tour with Brubeck. COL channel name VAL Ovidiu Temeo	0

Your figure is lovely 'et tres feminine'! My God\, you're so pretty\, Cecilia Lind."  But the band finished playing\, where could they go now? The street where she lived was near his anyhow.

These images are gritty and real. Sometimes history repeats itself\, but hopefully the worst is behind us. Although "Hard Times Come Again No More" sounds as if it were written during the Great Depression\, it was actually written in 1854 by Stephen C. Foster\, America's pioneer songwriter. Mavis Staples\, one of the greatest living gospel and R&B singers\, recorded the song as part of  the CD "Beautiful Dreamer - The Songs of Stephen Foster"  a tribute album released on the Emergent Music label in 2004. Included are many of his famous and some lesser known songs recorded with contemporary interpretations and arrangements.

Covers  "Venus" had been a part of Bananarama's repertoire for several years before they actually recorded it. The team's three members\, Sara Dallin\, Siobhan Fahey\, and Keren Woodward\, had the idea of turning the song into a dance music tune\, but they were met with resistance from their producers at the time\, Steve Jolley and Tony Swain. Bananarama brought the idea to the production trio of Stock Aitken Waterman\, and it became Bananarama's first collaboration with them. In 1969\, Bulgarian singer Lili Ivanova recorded her version of the song\, called "Venera" (Bulgarian: "Венера"). Tom Jones covered the song  in 1970. In 1970\, Greek band Olympians recorded the song "To koritsi tou Mai" (Greek: "Το κορίτσι του Μάη"\, meaning "Girl of May") with the melody of "Venus" and lyrics written by Sevi Tiliakou. On July 18\, 1981\, Dutch act Stars on 45 reached #1 in the U.S. with a medley including the opening guitar riff from "Venus". With the original Shocking Blue and the later Bananarama cover both going to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100\, this arguably made it the only song in that chart's history to hit #1 by three different artists\, though the Stars on 45 medley only included a portion. J-pop idol singer Yoko Nagayama covered it in 1986. A version of the song by The Chipettes\, done in their signature style\, was included on the album Born to Rock in 1988. They would also cover the Bananarama version for the 1998 album The A-Files: Alien Songs.

Other musicians include Donnie Winters (guitar)\, Gene Watson (bass) & Bobby Miller (drums). The Winters Brothers Band featuring Donnie Winters & yodeling king Don Winters on May 25\, 1986. Donnie\, his brother Dennis\, and the band received radio airplay in the 1970's as part of the southern rock scene. This was one of the few shows Donnie did without Dennis\, during this time period. Donnie's father the late Don Winters played with the band on this show. Don Winters performed with the late Marty Robbins for over a decade.  The Winters Brothers continue to have a TV show on the cable access channel.  I was instrumental in starting the Creekers Ball with announcer Danny Jones. In the 1980's\, it was yearly event in the River Road part of town\, showcasing bands in that area. Donnie and the band were nice enough to be our special guest at this annual charity event. I shot the video at all of the Creekers Ball events\, including this rare footage of the Winters Brothers Band. The sound quality is great\, as I came right out of the sound board\, and into a professional hi-fi recorder. Plus\, Donnie and the band sounded great.  Donnie currently runs a writers night on Tuesday Nights at Douglas Corner and sometimes plays at our own Play It Again Jam. I remember Donnie going all the way back to grade school in Nashville.

Written-By -- David Axlerod  ------------------------  "Mellow Yellow" is a song and single release by Donovan. It reached #2 on the Billboard charts in the U.S. in 1966 and #8 in the UK in early 1967.  The song was rumored to be about smoking dried banana skins\, which was believed to be a hallucinogenic drug in the 1960s\, though this aspect of bananas has since been debunked. According to Donovan's notes accompanying the album Donovan's Greatest Hits\, the rumor that one could get high from smoking dried banana skins was started by Country Joe McDonald in 1966\, and Donovan heard the rumor three weeks before "Mellow Yellow" was released as a single. (According to The Rolling Stone Illustrated Encyclopedia of Rock and Roll\, he admitted later the song made reference to a vibrator; an "electrical banana" as mentioned in the lyrics.) The phrase "mellow yellow" appears on page 719 of the first American edition of James Joyce's Ulysses\, where it is used to refer to Mrs. Marion Bloom's buttocks\, but it is not known if Donovan got the phrase from there.  The record had a "Beatlesque" feel to it\, and was sometimes mistaken for a Beatles song. Donovan\, in fact\, was friends with the Beatles. Paul McCartney can be heard as one of the background revelers on this track\, but contrary to popular belief\, it is not McCartney whispering the "quite rightly" answering lines in the chorus\, but rather Donovan himself. Donovan had a small part in coming up with the lyrics for "Yellow Submarine"\, and McCartney played bass guitar (uncredited) on portions of Donovan's Mellow Yellow album.  Covers  R&B and jazz singer Georgie Fame recorded his own version with a distinctively different arrangement reminiscent of the Count Basie orchestra.  Charly B. also covered the song in 1983\, in Italo disco style.  In 1999\, "Mellow Yellow" was sung by a group of young adults\, among whom were then-unknowns Alex Greenwald\, Rashida Jones and Jason Thompson\, in Gap's "Everybody in Cords" commercial directed by Pedro Romhanyi. The music mix was done by the Dust Brothers.  In 2011\, the song was featured in a new commercial for Mello Yello drink\, as part of Coca-Cola's "Original Smooth" campaign to rebrand and reintroduce the drink. Also\, the song itself was covered by Family of the Year featuring Donovan. The version is available for download on the Mello Yello website.  Other adaptations  Cadbury used a modified version of the song to promote their Caramello Koala chocolates ("They call me Caramello ... Koala").  The song was also used in a series of television commercials to promote the use of butter.  In France\, Lipton used a modified version of the song to promote their tea ("They call me Lipton Yellow").  One of the oldest coffeeshops in Amsterdam is called "Mellow Yellow".  In episode 17 of the 5th season of Scrubs\, JD figures out the song is about jaundice (not quite rightly).  Jimi Hendrix made a reference to this song in his song "Bold As Love".  Frank Zappa referenced the song in his number "Absolutely Free" on the album We're Only In It For The Money (1967). COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

It was produced and directed by Frank Tashlin\, with a screenplay adapted by Tashlin and Herbert Baker from an uncredited novel Do Re Me by Garson Kanin. The movie was originally intended as a vehicle for the American sex symbol Jayne Mansfield\, with a satirical subplot involving teenagers and rock 'n' roll music. The unintended result has been called the "most potent" celebration of rock music ever captured on film.[3] The original music score\, including a title song performed by Little Richard\, was by Bobby Troup\, with an additional credit to Ray Anthony for the tune "Big Band Boogie". It was shot in DeLuxe Color\, filmed in CinemaScope\, and runs 99 minutes. COL channel name VAL AtoZofRockandRoll	0

It is London's trademark for the most advanced and flexible of all stereo recording techniques; it stands for motion and an uncanny sense of spatial realism unapproached by conventional disc standards; it is your assurance of unmatched quality control\, rigorously applied from studio to finished disc\, throughout every single step of the manufacturing process. Perhaps the most remarkable innovation of "phase 4" is the use of London's custom built 20 channel console mixer. This complex and forbidding-looking machine permits sounds from no less than twenty separate sources to be combined and blended in precise perspective. Each instrument can be pinpointed at exact locations from extreme left to extreme right along the horizontal plane\, or forward and back through an astonishingly large depth of field. This\, of course\, is only part of the "phase 4" story. The making of the master tape\, the cutting of the master lacquer disc\, production of the final copy for the consumer -all are done with custom equipment\, under the constant supervision of both engineers and musicians. The statement that the 500\,000th record produced is identical in sound performance with the very first copy pressed is no idle boast: it is part of the  unique and proud credo of "phase 4 stereo". »   Phase4Stereo :  Please use as a series only\, adding it together with the Decca or London Records labels. The mono parallel series and technique was Sound 4. Phase 4 Stereo was a series created in 1961\, supposedly for better sound\, by being recorded on a 10-channel\, and later 20-channel\, recording console. Approximately 200 LPs were released under this branch\, including popular music\, "gimmick" records engineered to make the sound travel from speaker to speaker\, records featuring percussion effects\, and historical sound-effect records. In 1964\, a light-classical Phase 4 Stereo Concert  Series was produced. COL channel name VAL Art Buggy's Cheesecakes	0

COL title VAL These Foolish Things (Remind Me of You) COL performer VAL Emmy Rossum	COL video title VAL Sarah Vaughan - These Foolish Things COL description VAL The Lonely Hours\, Sarah Vaughan's contribution to the genre of saloon song LPs\, doesn't have a stellar selection of material — although of course nearly anything recorded by one of America's foremost jazz interpreters is worth hearing. Add to that the special treat of Benny Carter — the seminal altoist who'd been contributing charts to the hottest big bands since 1928 — occupying the arranger's chair\, and The Lonely Hours becomes a very intriguing proposition. Carter's refined arrangements and ensemble playing don't exactly reinforce the isolation of the title\, but Vaughan sounds excellent on "I'll Never Be the Same\," "These Foolish Things\," and "If I Had You\," lightly caressing the notes. For "You're Driving Me Crazy" and "What'll I Do\," she cleverly mirrors the comic frustration embodied in Carter's flügelhorn/tuba ensemble. Hopefully\, Carter wasn't responsible for the occasionally canned sound of the strings; The Lonely Hours is a solid match of vocalist and arranger in most respects\, with only the quality of the material weighing it down slightly.

That it is\, combining about a dozen of her early-'60s tracks for Highland and Brunswick -- the first of which were done with the Originals\, the later of which were done simply as Rosie -- with ten previously unissued tracks from a 1969 session. "Angel Baby" was a memorable\, unique single\, but Rosie Hamlin\, who wrote most of the material she recorded\, didn't have much else to offer as either a singer or songwriter. Most of her post-"Angel Baby" output was similar and inferior to that hit\, often so elementary in content as to be banal. These tracks laid out the same sort of doo wop/pop-rock ballads\, exploiting her propensity to hit high\, wordless notes that sounded a little like a record rotating at a slightly higher-than-normal speed. "Lonely Blue Nights\," her only record to chart (which it did\, lowly) besides "Angel Baby\," is here\, and is so close to "Angel Baby" in structure that one wonders why anyone would be surprised that it didn't rise any higher than #66. The 1969 sessions are mediocre updates of her transitional doo wop-to-girl group sound\, with more modern arrangements (noted session player Jerry Scheff is on bass) that mute whatever charm was heard on the early-'60s sides. As marginal enticements for serious collectors\, this includes the wholly uncharacteristic B-side of "Angel Baby\," a disorganized\, improvised R&B tune on which male R&B singer Bluford D. Wade (who wasn't in the Originals) takes lead vocals. There's also a different\, and worse\, alternate take of "Angel Baby" that was only issued in the U.K.  my name is Amnon from NYC.

COL title VAL Walk on the Wild Side COL performer VAL Aram Quartet	COL video title VAL Teddy Randazzo - Kiddio (Alan Freed's Mr. Rock and Roll) COL description VAL Teddy Randazzo was never quite as visible as other New York-spawned rock 'n' roll talent of the 1950's -- to name a few\, Dion was more of a star and for a lot longer\, and the various members of Jay & The Americans enjoyed hits right to the outset of the 1970's. But Randazzo had his day in the sun as a singer\, and he also wrote hundreds of songs\, and saw many dozens of recordings of the best of his work. Born in Brooklyn in 1937\, he was lucky enough to grow up in a musical family\, and by 15 was a good enough accordion player to turn professional\, as a member of the group the Three Chuckles\, who were in the market for a new keyboardman and singer -- the singing took a little time to develop\, with help from his decade-older fellow group members Tommy Romano and Russ Gilberto\, but when the group started recording\, it was the sides that Randazzo sang on that initially hit\, and by 1955\, at 17\, he was the frontman for the group. They had a number one hit with "And The Angels Sing"\, which had a rocking beat and brought them to the attention of deejay Alan Freed\, who put the group into his first jukebox movie\, Rock\, Rock\, Rock (shot in New York\, in the Bronx\, actually)\, but also gave Randazzo a solo spot.  When the smoke cleared from the movie\, Randazzo had decided to go solo. He continued recording for Vik Records\, a unit of RCA Victor\, and enjoyed a minor success in 1958 with "Little Serenade"\, and made an appearance in Freed's next movie\, Mister Rock And Roll\, as well as in the 20th Century-Fox CinemaScope color production The Girl Can't Help It\, among other movies. By 1960\, he'd moved to ABC-Paramount\, where he had another minor hit with "The Way Of A Clown"\, and in 1963 he had another small hit with "Big Wide World" on the Colpix label. But it was mostly as a songwriter and producer that Randazzo busied himself and made his real success in the music business; he wrote some 650 songs over the ensuing decades\, and saw them recorded by the likes of Frank Sinatra and Dionne Warwick. "Pretty Blue Eyes"\, authored with Bob Weinstein\, was a number one hit for Steve Lawrence. But it was with Little Anthony & The Imperials that he had his longest success -- in addition to producing the group\, he authored "Going Out Of My Head"\, "I'm On The Outside Looking In"\, and "Hurt So Bad" (later covered by Linda Ronstadt)\, among other hits.  Randazzo became less visible as the 1960's wore on\, and in the 1970's was largely forgotten by all except oldies fans. He remained active as a songwriter and behind-the-scenes\, and did the occasional live performance to keep his hand in\, but by then he was earning a good income from his annual royalties. He busied himself in local production in both Florida and Hawaii\, especially the latter\, and reportedly enjoyed a very happy second marriage -- his son from his first marriage\, Teddy Randazzo Jr.\, has also had a successful music career. Randazzo died in his sleep in 2003. ~ Bruce Eder\, All Music Guide  PLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels\, Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

Available in physical form direct from website http://HistoryofRnB.net   Download from   Amazon http://www.amazon.co.uk/Those-Hoodlum-Friends-Coasters-Stereo/dp/B00BR0QU6A/ref=dm_cd_album_lnk  iTunes https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/those-hoodlum-friends-coasters/id609884465    Stream from Spotify http://open.spotify.com/album/6IDmQkLUjCQe6poBO4izrg   The Coasters had the benefit of recording in the best studios\, backed by the best musicians and produced by the top producers of their generation\, Leiber and Stoller. Naturally\, they were required to run through as many takes of each song as was necessary to satisfy the exacting demands of their mentors. Luckily for us\, many of these alternate takes have survived. Mono was the standard recording format until the late 1960s\, but many of the big selling artists also recorded alternate versions specifically for the stereo market\, which was targeted to the discerning adult listener.     Disc One features all the alternate stereo versions of Coasters songs that were issued at the time on album and subsequently on CD. Disc Two takes you deep into the heart of Coasters sessions with composite tracks which combine studio chatter together with the finest moments from various different takes. This disc contains several outtakes which have until now been unavailable anywhere and gives an invaluable insight into the genesis of many well-loved tracks and also into the character and working practice of the Coasters and of their producers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller.     The accompanying 24-page booklet includes many rare photos and an exhaustive session discography by Claus Röhnisch. A collection for Coasters and early rock 'n' roll aficionados!

COL title VAL What Child Is This? COL performer VAL Folk Angel	COL video title VAL Mitch Miller - Carolina In The Morning (VintageMusic.es) COL description VAL Mitch Miller (nacido Mitchell William Miller el 4 de julio de 1911 en el seno de una familia judía en Rochester\, New York)\, es recordado como uno de los artistas de mayor éxito de los años cincuenta y comienzos de los sesenta. Fue también ejecutivo de la Columbia Records durante muchos años y lideró durante muchos años su propio coro masculino\, "Mitch Miller and the Gang"\, antes de abandonarlo él mismo.  Miller y su coro fueron famosos por su transgresor espectáculo televisivo de los sesenta titulado Sing Along With Mitch. Durante la segunda temporada del programa\, el mismo Mitch Miller acuñó el eslogan "All Smiles"\, que iba precedido por las instrucciones para "sing along; just follow the bouncing ball" (un gran punto que saltaba sobre las palabras que eran sobreimpresionadas en televisión a la canción que Mitch estaba cantando). Los mayores éxitos de Miller con el coro fueron "The Yellow Rose of Texas"\, una versión baterística de la vieja marcha\, y "Colonel Bogey March"\, que más tarde disfrutaría de una renovada popularidad tras su uso en la película The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957). Además de su espectáculo televisivo\, Miller y su coro grabaron varios discos que se vendieron muy bien.    "Mule Train\,"el primer gran éxito de Miller (para Frankie Laine) y la fundación de su carrera\, establecieron el modelo para virtualmente toda la primera década del rock. Las similitudes entre ese tema y\, por ejemplo\, "Leader of the Pack"\, casi no es necesario subrayarlas aquí.  Miller firmó y produjo a muchos importantes artistas especializados en estándares del pop\, como Frankie Laine\, Johnnie Ray\, Ray Conniff\, Percy Faith\, Johnny Mathis\, Tony Bennett\, Guy Mitchell (cuyo pseudónimo en realidad estaba basado en el nombre de Miller)\, y ayudó directamente a las carreras de artistas que ya habían firmado con el sello\, como Doris Day\, Dinah Shore y Jo Stafford por nombrar a unos pocos. Miller se convirtió en uno de los más exitosos productores de música pop de la historia.  Miller es frecuentemente descrito por historiadores del rock como un enemigo del primer rock and roll. Miller hizo echar marcha atrás al contrato que John Hammond le había hecho a Bob Dylan para capitalizar la emergente moda de la música folk. Aunque finalmente perdería su trabajo en Columbia por negarse a producir el tipo de música que estaban comprando los adolescentes\, en principio Miller había intentado contratar a Elvis Presley\, aunque reculó ante las cifras que le pedía el manager de Elvis\, Colonel Tom Parker. Graduado en la Eastman School of Music\, Miller es también un consumado intérprete de oboe y corno inglés. Consiguió algún dinero en los comienzos de su carrera en los años treinta y cuarenta como intéprete de oboe; de hecho\, en esos años\, fue llamado en su calidad de oboísta\, por George Gershwin\, para integrar un conjunto de 55 músicos\, que saldrían de gira\, interpretando sus principales obras de esa época.  También integró\, en 1935\, la orquesta del estreno de "Porgy & Bess". Entre sus más admiradas interpretaciones de estudio dentro del terreno no clásico\, están sus aportes para The Voice of Frank Sinatra y para Bird With Strings de Charlie Parker. Miller recibió el Premio Grammy por toda una vida en 2000.

COL title VAL La bamba COL performer VAL Nicola Di Bari	COL video title VAL Roland Shaw -- La Bamba COL description VAL Roland Shaw\, born Roland Edgar Shaw-Tomkins\, (26 May 1920 - 11 May 2012) was an English composer\, musical arranger\, and orchestra leader. Shaw\, who was born in Leicester attended the Trinity College of Music and served in the Royal Air Force in World War II leading RAF No 1 Band of the Middle East Forces. Following wartime service he arranged music for Ted Heath\, Teddy Foster\, Mantovani and many others. He became an arranger and record producer for Decca Records with his orchestra recording for that label and Phase 4 Stereo. His orchestra performed on the albums Mexico and Westward Ho. In December 1964 his orchestra released an album of cover versions of Themes from the James Bond Thrillers to coincide with the American release of Goldfinger. The popularity of Shaw's arrangements of Bond themes led to More Themes from the James Bond Thrillers for the release ofThunderball with tracks from both albums released on a UK album called James Bond in Action. In 1966 Shaw's orchestra performed Themes for Secret Agents.Themes from the James Bond Thrillers Vol.3/More James Bond in Action followed the release of Casino Royale and You Only Live Twice in 1967. Shaw came back in 1971 for The Return of James Bond/The Phase 4 World of Spy Thrillers for the release of Sean Connery's return as Bond in Diamonds Are Forever. Shaw recruited guitarist Vic Flick to repeat his guitar playing on the Gypsy Camp track. Shaw arranged music for films such as Summer Holiday (1963) and The Secret of My Success (1965) and wrote the score for Straight on Till Morning.

COL title VAL Rave On COL performer VAL Waylon Jennings	COL video title VAL Wade in the water - Charlie Haden and Hank Jones-Steal Away COL description VAL I have no rights for this content. Buy the CD\, well worth it.  STEAL AWAY was nominated for a 1996 Grammy Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Performance\, Individual Or Group. "Go Down\, Moses" was nominated for a Grammy for Best Jazz Instrumental Solo.  From the outset of his career with Ornette Coleman\, through his work with pianist Keith Jarrett\, his own Liberation Music Orchestra and collaborations with the likes of Paul Motian\, Hampton Hawes\, Chet Baker\, Carlos Paredes and Ginger Baker\, bassist Charlie Haden has always accorded the spiritual component of music greater importance than its technical considerations.  Haden's finest work has always focused on the most intimate\, humanistic principles: freedom\, justice\, quality. In pianist Hank Jones\, Haden encounters a collaborator and fellow traveller whose musical instincts are every inch as elegant and refined as his own. And in the rich public domain of materials which make up STEAL AWAY\, Haden and Jones take on an oral (and moral) tradition of music that has been inspiring listeners since before the time of the underground railroad.  Recorded at Radio Canada\, Montreal\, Canada on June 29 & 30\, 1994. Includes liner notes by Maurice Jackson\, Charlie Haden and Abbey Lincoln.  Personnel: Hank Jones (piano).  Audio Mixer: Jay Newland.  Liner Note Author: Maurice Jackson.  Recording information: Radio Canada\, Montreal\, Canada (06/29/1994/06/30/1994).  Photographer: Walker Evans.

It is London's trademark for the most advanced and flexible of all stereo recording techniques; it stands for motion and an uncanny sense of spatial realism unapproached by conventional disc standards; it is your assurance of unmatched quality control\, rigorously applied from studio to finished disc\, throughout every single step of the manufacturing process. Perhaps the most remarkable innovation of "phase 4" is the use of London's custom built 20 channel console mixer. This complex and forbidding-looking machine permits sounds from no less than twenty separate sources to be combined and blended in precise perspective. Each instrument can be pinpointed at exact locations from extreme left to extreme right along the horizontal plane\, or forward and back through an astonishingly large depth of field. This\, of course\, is only part of the "phase 4" story. The making of the master tape\, the cutting of the master lacquer disc\, production of the final copy for the consumer -all are done with custom equipment\, under the constant supervision of both engineers and musicians. The statement that the 500\,000th record produced is identical in sound performance with the very first copy pressed is no idle boast: it is part of the  unique and proud credo of "phase 4 stereo". »   Phase4Stereo :  Please use as a series only\, adding it together with the Decca or London Records labels. The mono parallel series and technique was Sound 4. Phase 4 Stereo was a series created in 1961\, supposedly for better sound\, by being recorded on a 10-channel\, and later 20-channel\, recording console. Approximately 200 LPs were released under this branch\, including popular music\, "gimmick" records engineered to make the sound travel from speaker to speaker\, records featuring percussion effects\, and historical sound-effect records. In 1964\, a light-classical Phase 4 Stereo Concert  Series was produced. COL channel name VAL Art Buggy's Cheesecakes	0

Recorded on September 17\, 1952 at Columbia's Thirtieth St. studio in New York City\, and arranged and conducted by Percy Faith\, it was released as a 78 and 45 R.P.M single. It can be found on CD on The Voice - The Columbia Years 1943-1952 and The Columbia Years 1943 - 1952 The Complete Recordings.  Recorded at a low point in his career\, it perfectly captures his emotions at the time.  Sinatra had been under a great deal of pressure from Mitch Miller\, the head of Columbia's Artists and Repertoire Division to record material that Sinatra considered inappropriate\, resulting in his departure from Columbia. This gem was Sinatra's parting shot. He was to record it again in 1959 with Gordon Jenkins for the No One Cares LP on Capitol.

COL title VAL Recado Bossa Nova COL performer VAL Grace Mahya	COL video title VAL Sarah Vaughan - These Foolish Things COL description VAL The Lonely Hours\, Sarah Vaughan's contribution to the genre of saloon song LPs\, doesn't have a stellar selection of material — although of course nearly anything recorded by one of America's foremost jazz interpreters is worth hearing. Add to that the special treat of Benny Carter — the seminal altoist who'd been contributing charts to the hottest big bands since 1928 — occupying the arranger's chair\, and The Lonely Hours becomes a very intriguing proposition. Carter's refined arrangements and ensemble playing don't exactly reinforce the isolation of the title\, but Vaughan sounds excellent on "I'll Never Be the Same\," "These Foolish Things\," and "If I Had You\," lightly caressing the notes. For "You're Driving Me Crazy" and "What'll I Do\," she cleverly mirrors the comic frustration embodied in Carter's flügelhorn/tuba ensemble. Hopefully\, Carter wasn't responsible for the occasionally canned sound of the strings; The Lonely Hours is a solid match of vocalist and arranger in most respects\, with only the quality of the material weighing it down slightly.

COL title VAL We Need a Little Christmas COL performer VAL Carter Moulton	COL video title VAL Chuzpe - Love Will Tear Us Apart (Joy Division Cover) COL description VAL From '' Love Will Tear Us Apart '' Label: GiG Records ‎-- GIG 111 103 Format: Vinyl\, 7"\, Single\, 45 RPM Country: Austria Released: 1980  Tracklist A Love Will Tear Us Apart B Love Will Tear Us Apart (Instrumental)  Performer -- Christian Brandl\, Gunulf\, Robert Wolf\, Stephan Graf Hadik Wildner Producer\, Arranged By -- Wolfgang Strobl  ------------------------  "Love Will Tear Us Apart" is a song by the British post-punk band Joy Division. It was written in August and September 1979\, and debuted when the band supported Buzzcocks on their UK tour in September and October 1979. It is one of the few songs in which singer Ian Curtis played guitar (albeit somewhat minimally). The lyrics ostensibly reflect the problems in Ian Curtis's marriage to Deborah Curtis\, as well as his general frame of mind in the time leading up to his suicide in May 1980.  The song was first released in April 1980 and\, after Curtis's suicide that May\, became the band's first chart hit\, reaching number 13 in the UK. It also debuted at #1 in New Zealand in June 1981. The band postponed their US tour after his death\, performed a few short sets as The No-Names\, then finally renamed the group as New Order. "Love" was re-released in 1983 and reached number 19 on the UK charts and re-appeared at #3 in New Zealand during March 1984. In November 1988\, it made one more Top 40 appearance in New Zealand\, peaking at #39. "Love Will Tear Us Apart" appears on the Substance compilation album. It was first recorded for a John Peel session in November 1979\, then re-recorded in January 1980 and March 1980. It is the latter version that appears on Substance. The January 1980 version originally appeared as the single's B-side.  Popularity  "Love Will Tear Us Apart" has remained popular and was listed by NME magazine as the best single of all time in 2002. The song was listed by Rolling Stone magazine at number 179 in its top 500 songs of all time. In May 2007\, NME placed it at number 19 in its list of the 50 Greatest Indie Anthems Ever\, one place ahead of another Joy Division song\, "Transmission". The song reached number 1 in the inaugural Triple J Hottest 100 music poll of 1989 and again in 1990. When being interviewed for New Order Story\, Neil Tennant of the Pet Shop Boys stated that "Love Will Tear Us Apart" was his favourite pop song of all time. He also mentioned several New Order songs in the same dialogue.  Films  The song has also been used in television programs and in films\, such as the 2001 film Donnie Darko\, in a pivotal scene before Donnie has to leave his girlfriend in order to save her. The song is included in the indie film Wristcutters\, which takes place in an afterlife for people who have committed suicide. It was also included in a film about the Manchester music scene\, 24 Hour Party People\, during several scenes about the band and Curtis's suicide. It is heard in the Doctor Who episode "School Reunion". The film Series 7: The Contenders features a music video for the song which characters explain as being part of a school project. Their homemade music video is in the style of a cheaply made '80s video with actors dressed in stereotypical goth fashion. In the sci-fi comedy radio series Undone\, the song is performed as a chime on an ice cream van. On November 11\, 2009 it was featured in the opening scene of episode 7 of season 5 ("The Performer") of the television series Criminal Minds. "Love Will Tear Us Apart" was also featured at the beginning of UK police drama\, Silent Witness in the episode "Voids: Part 1".  Cover versions  "Love Will Tear Us Apart" was eventually performed by New Order (though not for 18 years after Curtis's suicide) and has been covered by many artists including: Thom Yorke\, Mark Owen\, Björk\, Nerina Pallot\, Hawksley Workman\, Calexico\, Bloc Party\, The Cure\, Swans\, Unbroken\, Broken Social Scene\, Nouvelle Vague\, Heavens\, Fall Out Boy\, José González\, Red Mecca\, Yat-Kha\, Stanton Miranda\, U2\, John Frusciante\, Arcade Fire\, REVERE\, Squarepusher\, Honeyroot\, Chris Edwards\, Susanna and the Magical Orchestra\, Moonspell\, The Blood Divine\, Simple Minds\, Oysterband with June Tabor\, Paul Young\, Jamie Cullum\, Evelyn Evelyn and In the Nursery.  The song "Let's Dance to Joy Division" by UK act The Wombats was inspired by "Love Will Tear Us Apart"\, and includes "let love tear us apart" in the lyrics; similarly\, Kasper Bjørke's song "Alcatrez" references "Love Will Tear Us Apart": "Do you think it's true that our love will tear us apart?"  Serbian rock musician\, journalist and writer Dejan Cukić wrote about "Love Will Tear Us Apart" as one of the forty-six songs that changed history of popular music in his 2007 book 45 obrtaja: Priče o pesmama.  Broken Social Scene's cover was featured in the soundtrack for The Time Traveler's Wife . COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

COL title VAL I Know My Babe COL performer VAL John Renbourn	COL video title VAL Xavier Cugat and His Orchestra -  Night Train COL description VAL " I only sing in the shower. I would join a choir\, but I don't think my bathtub can hold that many people.  "  ― Jarod Kintz  "Night Train" has a long and complicated history. The piece's opening riff was first recorded in 1940 by a small group led by Duke Ellington sideman Johnny Hodges under the title "That's the Blues\, Old Man". Ellington used the same riff as the opening and closing theme of a longer-form composition\, "Happy-Go-Lucky Local"\, that was itself one of four parts of his Deep South Suite. Forrest was part of Ellington's band when it performed this composition\, which has a long tenor saxophone break in the middle. After leaving Ellington\, Forrest recorded "Night Train" on United Records and had a major rhythm & blues hit. While "Night Train" employs the same riff as the earlier recordings\, it is used in a much earthier R&B setting. Forrest inserted his own solo over a stop-time rhythm not used in the Ellington composition. He put his own stamp on the tune\, but its relation to the earlier composition is obvious. Like Illinois Jacquet's solo on "Flying Home"\, Forrest's original saxophone solo on "Night Train" became a veritable part of the composition\, and is usually recreated in cover versions by other performers. Buddy Morrow's trombone transcription of Forrest's solo from his big-band recording of the tune is similarly incorporated into many performances. Broadcast Music\, Inc. (BMI) credits the composition to Jimmy Forrest and Oscar Washington. Xavier "Cugie" Cugat adds some ingredients of his own musical style and brings us a "latin" sounding arrangement here that really swings !  Cugat's rhythm section plays an important part in this rendition which makes the song even more danceable. From the 1964 Album "Caricatures" here's Xavier Cugat and His Orchestra with that golden blues & jazz standard : "Night Train".   Enjoy the ride ;) ! COL channel name VAL Socratess2007	0

He was to be featured with the Savoy Orpheans later. Leslie Jeffries delivers this delightful tune with aplomb\, from October 1924\, when the 20's were beginning to roar.

COL title VAL Hey Girl COL performer VAL Johnny Tillotson	COL video title VAL Bees Make Honey - Bloodshot Eyes COL description VAL Album: Music Every Night(1973). Bees Make Honey was one of the most influential band in the early Pub rock movement in the UK. Formed late in 1971 in north London by Barry Richardson\, Ruan O’Lochlainn\, Deke O’Brien and Mick Molloy\, former members of Irish showband The Alpine Seven\, and American drummer Bob “Cee” Siebenberg\, who would later rise to fame in Supertramp. While touring heavily on the emerging Pub rock circuit\, Bees Make Honey signed with record label EMI to record its debut album "Music Every Night". By the time the album was released\, the band was already beginning to break up. Frequent line-up changes preceded the dissolution of the band in 1974. Richardson went onto his own Barry Richardson Band. Demick and Finlayson subsequently resurfaced in Meal Ticket and Byrne moved onto Ace. Ruan O'Lochlainn formed Riff Raff with a young Biilly Bragg. Produced by manager Robinson - this is probably one of the best of Pub Rock albums. Largely written by Richardson  and O'Brien\, exemplified by tracks such as "Kentucky Chicken Fry" and "Booterstown" the album's full of taunt and enthusiastic rockers. Imminently likeable\, to be honest there are only a few missteps including the mildly country-flavored title track. Curiously the set didn't see an American release.

COL title VAL After You've Gone COL performer VAL Jim Galloway\, Dick Wellstood\, Pete Magadini	COL video title VAL Freddie Taylor & Django Reinhardt - After You've Gone - 1936 May 4 - Gramophone\, Paris COL description VAL Django Reinhardt et le Quintette du Hot Club de France\, avec Stéphane Grappelli  Stéphane Grappelli (v);  Django Reinhardt (g solo);  Joseph Reinhardt\, Pierre "Baro" Ferret (g);  Lucien Simoens (b);  Freddy Taylor (vo)   After its initial recordings on Ultraphone and Decca\, the QHCF moved to the HMV label.  "After You've Gone" was recorded on their first session for the label and there seems to have been some growing pains. The balance is not as good as on the other labels\, with especially weak recording of the bass.  The opening chorus is by Grappelli this time around and he is immediately followed by the Louis Armstrong-inspired singing of Freddie Taylor. It seems that everyone is holding back in these opening choruses\, and sure enough\, as soon as Taylor is finished\, the intensity goes up as Django goes into a finger-busting chorus filled with fast arpeggios and runs\, and concluding with a chorded intro to Grappelli. The violinist takes charge\, building the intensity with every chorus. The breaks\, built into the tune at the end of each 16-bar section\, seem to have little effect on Taylor\, but each time Reinhardt and Grappelli hit them\, they add to the growing excitement of the recording.   1936 May 4 - Gramophone\, Paris COL channel name VAL Heinz Becker	1

It was produced and directed by Frank Tashlin\, with a screenplay adapted by Tashlin and Herbert Baker from an uncredited novel Do Re Me by Garson Kanin. The movie was originally intended as a vehicle for the American sex symbol Jayne Mansfield\, with a satirical subplot involving teenagers and rock 'n' roll music. The unintended result has been called the "most potent" celebration of rock music ever captured on film.[3] The original music score\, including a title song performed by Little Richard\, was by Bobby Troup\, with an additional credit to Ray Anthony for the tune "Big Band Boogie". It was shot in DeLuxe Color\, filmed in CinemaScope\, and runs 99 minutes. COL channel name VAL AtoZofRockandRoll	0

Clifford\, Kelleher\, O'Neill\, Yeates; (c) 1994 Four to the Bar  LYRICS Her eyes they shone like diamonds I thought her the queen of the land And her hair it hung over her shoulder Tied up with an black velvet band  In a neat little town they call Belfast apprentice to trade I was bound And many an hour of sweet happiness have I spent in that neat little town A sad misfortune came over me which caused me to stray from the land Far away from my friends and relations betrayed by the black velvet band  I took a stroll down Broadway meaning not long for to stay When whom should I meet but this pretty fair maid come a-traipsing along the highway She was both fair and handsome\, her neck it was just like a swan And her hair it hung over her shoulder tied up with a black velvet band  I took a stroll with this pretty fair maid\, and a gentleman passing us by I knew she meant the doing of him by the look in her roguish black eye A gold watch she took from his pocket and placed it right into my hand And the very first thing that I said was\, Bad cess to the black velvet band  Before the judge and the jury next morning I had to appear The judge he says to me\, Young man\, your case it is proven clear We'll give you seven years penal servitude to be spent far away from the land Far away from your friends and relations\, betrayed by the black velvet band  So come all ye jolly young fellows\, a warning take by me When you're out on the town me lads\, beware of the pretty colleens They'll feed you with strong drink me lads\, till you are unable to stand And the very first thing that you know is\, you've landed in Van Diemen's Land  I've been a wild rover for manys the year\, And I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer\, But now I'm returning with gold in great store\, And I never will play the wild rover no more.  And it's No\, Nay\, Never\,  No\, Nay\, Never\, No more\, Will I play the wild rover\, No\, never\, No more.  I went into an alehouse I used to frequent\, And I told the landlady my money was spent\, I asked her for credit\, she answered me Nay\, Such custom as yours I could have every day.  I brought up from my pockets 10 sovereigns bright\, And the landlady's eyes lit up with delight\, She said I have whiskey and wines of the best\, And the words that I told you were only in jest.  I¹ll go home to my parents\, confess what I¹ve done\, And I¹ll ask them to pardon their prodigal son. And when they¹ve caressed me as oft times before\, I never will play the wild rover no more.  At Orenmore in the County Galway\, One pleasant evening in the month of May\, I spied a damsel\, she was young and handsome Her beauty fairly took my breath away.  She wore no jewels\, nor costly diamonds\, No paint or powder\, no\, none at all. But she wore a bonnet with a ribbon on it And round her shoulder was a Galway Shawl.  We kept on walking\, she kept on talking\, 'Till her father's cottage came into view. Says she: 'Come in\, sir\, and meet my father\, And play to please him " The Foggy Dew."  She sat me down beside the fire I could see her father\, he was six feet tall. And soon her mother had the kettle singing All I could think of was the Galway shawl.  I played "The Blackbird" and "The Stack of Barley"\, " Rodney's Glory" and "The Foggy Dew"\, She sang each note like an Irish linnet. Whilst the tears stood in her eyes of blue.  'Twas early\, early\, all in the morning\, When I hit the road for old Donegal. She said 'Goodby\, sir\,'she cried and kissed me\, And my heart remained with that Galway shawl.

Lyrics: I was a stranger in the city Out of town were the people I knew I had that feeling of self pity What to do\, what to do\, what to do? The outlook was decidedly blue But as I walked through the foggy streets alone It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known A foggy day\, in London town\, it had me low\, and it had me down\, I viewed the morning\, with much alarm\, the British Museum\, had lost its charm\, How long I wondered\, could this thing last\, but the age of miracles\, it hadn't past\, And suddenly\, I saw you standing right there\, And in foggy London town\, the sun was shining everywhere.

(1945) Richard Rodgers\, Oscar Hammerstein II   The things I used to like I don't like anymore.  I want a lot of other things  I've never had before. It's just like mother says... I sit around and mope. Pretending I am wonderful. And knowing I'm a dope.  I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm\, I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string. I'd say that I had spring fever\, But I know it isn't spring.  I'm starry-eyed and vaguely discontented Like a nightingale without a song to sing. Oh\, why should I have spring fever When it isn't even spring?  I keep wishing I were somewhere else\,  Walking down a strange new street. Hearing words that I have never heard From a girl\, I've yet to meet.  I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams\, I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing. I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud Or a robin on the wing.  But I feel so gay\, In a melancholy way\, That it might as well be spring\,  It might as well be spring. COL channel name VAL J.

I would join a choir\, but I don't think my bathtub can hold that many people.  "  ― Jarod Kintz  "Night Train" has a long and complicated history. The piece's opening riff was first recorded in 1940 by a small group led by Duke Ellington sideman Johnny Hodges under the title "That's the Blues\, Old Man". Ellington used the same riff as the opening and closing theme of a longer-form composition\, "Happy-Go-Lucky Local"\, that was itself one of four parts of his Deep South Suite. Forrest was part of Ellington's band when it performed this composition\, which has a long tenor saxophone break in the middle. After leaving Ellington\, Forrest recorded "Night Train" on United Records and had a major rhythm & blues hit. While "Night Train" employs the same riff as the earlier recordings\, it is used in a much earthier R&B setting. Forrest inserted his own solo over a stop-time rhythm not used in the Ellington composition. He put his own stamp on the tune\, but its relation to the earlier composition is obvious. Like Illinois Jacquet's solo on "Flying Home"\, Forrest's original saxophone solo on "Night Train" became a veritable part of the composition\, and is usually recreated in cover versions by other performers. Buddy Morrow's trombone transcription of Forrest's solo from his big-band recording of the tune is similarly incorporated into many performances. Broadcast Music\, Inc. (BMI) credits the composition to Jimmy Forrest and Oscar Washington. Xavier "Cugie" Cugat adds some ingredients of his own musical style and brings us a "latin" sounding arrangement here that really swings !  Cugat's rhythm section plays an important part in this rendition which makes the song even more danceable. From the 1964 Album "Caricatures" here's Xavier Cugat and His Orchestra with that golden blues & jazz standard : "Night Train".   Enjoy the ride ;) ! COL channel name VAL Socratess2007	0

Blind since birth\, Kloss began playing professionally in Pittsburgh in the early '60s. He worked with Pat Martino in 1965\, the same year he started recording as a 16-year-old for Prestige. Through the years\, Kloss used such players on his records as Martino\, organist Don Patterson\, Jaki Byard\, Richard Davis\, Alan Dawson\, Cedar Walton\, Jimmy Owens\, Kenny Barron\, Jack DeJohnette\, Booker Ervin\, Chick Corea\, and Barry Miles\, in addition to collaborations with Richie Cole and duets with Gil Goldstein. But Eric Kloss seemed to disappear after his 1981 Omnisound album and has not been heard from by the jazz world in quite some time. --------------------------- I'll just add that Kloss is battling an illness these days...

Oh the memories this provokes!  Hope some others of you had to endure this in your childhood!  [Sleeve notes]  Christmas is the most joyful festival of the Christian year\, when we celebrate at the same time the turning point of winter and the new hope that was brought to men with the birth of Jesus.  Christmas is a time when we make up for the bleakness of the weather outside with the warmth of our spirits and it is no coincidence that the songs which have become particularly associated with Christmas should be carols\, which have always been the most cheerful and often the most secular of Christian songs.  On this record you will find your favourite carols in an unfamiliar guise - we've called the album 'Tijuana Christmas'\, but you will hear the mariachi sound taking on a richer and more varied flavour as the Torero Band bring out the charms of our most beautiful carol tunes in imaginative brand new arrangements.  'The Holly & the Ivy' sets the pace with a bright\, sparkling beat that even adds to the gaiety of one of our oldest and liveliest carols; 'Silent Night' a much more recent and a more devout carol\, is given quite a contrasting treatment\, slow and tender.  'Hark! The Herald Angels Sing' sets off again at a brisk\, bouncy pace - and if you feel like dancing\, why not?  It may come as a surprise to you that our oldest carols used to be dances and that the word itself described a form of circular dance.  In the preface to the Oxford Book of Carols you will find carols described as songs with a religious impulse that are simple\, popular and modern.  You'll never have heard them sounding more joyful\, popular or modern than they do on this exciting and original LP. (Blase Machin) COL channel name VAL choccystarfish1	1

I've only added the footage as a tribute for historical\, entertainment\, and creative purposes with no financial gain. Copyright infringement not intended.  Jessie Belvin "Goodnight My Love" 1956  This is a Mint- Copy of this great all-time classic\, please enjoy!  The all-time classic "Mr. Easy" Jessie Belvin   While not nearly as well remembered by the general public as either Sam Cooke or Otis Redding\, singer Jesse Belvin was in many regards a performer of equal stature whose career was also cut far too short by tragedy. At the time of his death\, Belvin was moving in the much the same direction as Cooke (he was even on the same record label\, although signed earlier)\, and was scoring and writing hits long before Redding ever cut a record. Jesse Lorenzo Belvin was born in San Antonio\, TX\, in 1932. When he was five\, his family relocated to Los Angeles\, and by age seven he was singing in church. He discovered R&B in his early teens\, and in 1950 joined jazz saxophonist Big Jay McNeely's backing vocal quartet Three Dots and a Dash. Belvin's falsetto was placed up front in his debut release\, 1950's "All the Wine Is Gone"; the response was so strong that on the group's next record\, his name was placed directly under McNeely's on the B-side\, "Sad Story." In 1952\, Belvin and bandmate Marvin Phillips signed to Specialty. They cut four singles: the first three — "Baby Don't Go\," "One Little Blessing\," and "Love of My Life" — were credited to Jesse Belvin\, and all failed to chart. The last\, "Dream Girl\," which featured Belvin on piano and vocals with Phillips on saxophone\, was credited to Jesse & Marvin\, and got to number two on the R&B charts in 1953.   It was with Modern that he cut his most enduring record. "Goodnight My Love" had been written by producer George Mottola ten years earlier\, but he had never been able to finish it; Belvin provided the lines for the bridge that completed the song\, but asked for 400 dollars in lieu of co-authorship credit. Mottola didn't have it\, but a colleague\, John Marascalco\, did\, and put up the money\, receiving co-authorship credit in the bargain.  The song reached number seven on the R&B charts in 1956; curiously\, the pianist on the recording was an 11-year-old session player making his recording debut named BARRY WHITE\, who would emerge as a giant in his own right about two decades later. More important at the time\, "Goodnight My Love" became the outro theme to Alan Freed's rock & roll radio show\, heard by millions of young listeners every night. Belvin cut ten singles for Modern\, of which "Goodnight My Love" was far and away the most successful. In 1958\, he was again on the move\, recording for Knight\, Class\, and Jamie Records under his own name\, as well as for the Aladdin label in association with the Sharptones.  His biggest success that year\, however\, came through a group called the Shields\, which had been formed by George Mottola to record on his own Tender label. Adding his voice to the mix\, Belvin joined the group\, which also included Frankie Ervin on lead\, Johnny "Guitar" Watson on bass\, baritone Tommy "Buster" Williams\, "Handsome" Mel Williams on second tenor\, Ernie Freeman on piano\, Irving Ashby on bass\, Rene Hall guitar\, and Davis Williams drums. The Shields' only record with Belvin was "You Cheated\," which had already been cut by a white group called the Slades; the Shields' version was the more successful\, reaching number 15 on the pop charts in the summer of 1958.  In late 1959\, with the encouragement of his wife and the support of producer Dick Pierce and arranger/conductor Marty Paich\, Belvin went into the studio for three recording dates that yielded a dozen songs\, among them intensely soulful covers of standards like "Blues in the Night\," "In the Still of the Night\," and "Makin' Whoopee." The band included Art Pepper on the sax and clarinet and Jack Sheldon on the trumpet\, and the playing was extraordinary all the way around.  Alas\, Belvin never heard the finished album\, Mr. Easy; on February 6\, 1960\, shortly after finishing a performance in Little Rock\, AR\, on a bill with Sam Cooke\, Jackie Wilson\, and Marv Johnson\, Belvin and his wife were killed in a head-on auto collision. Mr. Easy was released later in 1960\, his final testament and an enduring legacy.  This Is such a sad\, sad thing. God Bless you Jessie Belvin\, your life ended too soon\, but your soul & your music will still live on\, as long as we keep listening. R.I.P.

I sit around and mope. Pretending I am wonderful. And knowing I'm a dope.  I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm\, I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string. I'd say that I had spring fever\, But I know it isn't spring.  I'm starry-eyed and vaguely discontented Like a nightingale without a song to sing. Oh\, why should I have spring fever When it isn't even spring?  I keep wishing I were somewhere else\,  Walking down a strange new street. Hearing words that I have never heard From a girl\, I've yet to meet.  I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams\, I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing. I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud Or a robin on the wing.  But I feel so gay\, In a melancholy way\, That it might as well be spring\,  It might as well be spring. COL channel name VAL J.

Ring Of Fire  ------------------------  "Ring of Fire" or "The Ring of Fire" is a country music song popularized by Johnny Cash and co-written by June Carter (wife of Johnny Cash) and Merle Kilgore. The single appears on Cash's 1963 compilation album\, Ring of Fire: The Best of Johnny Cash. The song was originally recorded by June's sister\, Anita Carter\, on her Mercury Records album Folk Songs Old and New (1963) as "(Love's) Ring of Fire".  When the song failed to become a major hit for Anita\, Cash recorded it his own way\, adding the mariachi-style horns. This sound was later used in the song "It Ain't Me Babe"\, which was recorded around the same time. Mother Maybelle and the Carter sisters are prominently featured in the Cash recording singing harmony. Cash tinkered with a few of the original phrases in Anita Carter's version of the song:  Four years after the song was released\, Carter and Cash were married\, which Cash states helped to stop his alcohol and drug addictions. Cash's daughter Rosanne has stated\, "The song is about the transformative power of love and that's what it has always meant to me and that's what it will always mean to the Cash children.  The song was recorded on March 25\, 1963\, and became the biggest hit of Johnny Cash's career\, staying at number one on the charts for seven weeks.  Legacy  The most commercially successful cover version is by Social Distortion\, who released their punk rock version on the album Social Distortion (1990). The single reached #25 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks\, 27 years after the song was first recorded by Cash. Pop punk band Bowling for Soup would later cover the song on their live album Bowling for Soup: Live and Very Attractive.  The Eric Burdon & the Animals version\, recorded at the end of 1968\, charted in 1969 in the following countries: UK: #35\, GER: #24\, AUS: #10\, AU: #8\, NL: #4; it failed to chart in the US. In late 1974\, the Eric Burdon Band released a heavier version. In 2006\, Burdon performed the song sometimes at his concerts.  A cover of the song was released as a single by Alan Jackson on December 6\, 2010. His rendition of the song also features guest vocals from Lee Ann Womack. It peaked at #45\, becoming his first single to miss the Top 40 since "Blue Blooded Woman" also peaked at #45 in 1990.  Dwight Yoakam also recorded a version of the song\, on his debut album Guitars\, Cadillacs\, Etc.\, Etc.  The song was covered by Frank Zappa in the late 1980s\, and is offered on the 1995 The Best Band You Never Heard in Your Life. release showcasing a short-lived band lineup from a late-1988 tour. Zappa introduces the song by saying he'd met Johnny Cash that afternoon\, and that Johnny was going to come to the show and play with Zappa and his band\, but "his wife got sick." Zappa and the band proceed to play a seriously gonzo reggae version of the song\, with a caricature vocal impersonation of Johnny Cash. A euphemistic take on the song's title (meaning anal/rectal discomfort) permeates the song\, and a number of other numbers throughout the Best Band release. In the early 1980's\, the experimental/new wave band "Wall of Voodoo" (Mexican Radio) recorded a version of "Ring of Fire" that included extended guitar and synthesizer solos. This version of song can be found on the Wall of Voodoo compilation album "Grandma's House\," and can also be heard as background music in the adult film "Night Dreams." This version of the song also includes some slight rearrangement in so much as the repeating background music (layered behind the synth and lead guitar solos at the end of the song\,) borrows very heavily from the repeating incidental music in the "Flint" movies\, ("In Like Flint"\, "Our Man Flint\,") starring James Coburn.  The song is sung at the Molineux by the fans of Wolverhampton Wanderers  Use in media  "Ring of Fire" ranked #4 on CMT's 100 Greatest Songs in Country Music in 2003 and #87 on Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.  The song has also been featured in some video games: the original 1963 song was featured in Tony Hawk's Underground 2\, while a live version recorded in 1987 appeared in Guitar Hero 5 (which features a virtual avatar of Cash). The Social Distortion cover is a downloadable track for the Rock Band series (with the original song also confirmed for download in Rock Band 3) and is featured in Shaun White Snowboarding.  Blondie performed the song in the film Roadie (1980). The live recording was featured on the film soundtrack\, and on a reissue of the Blondie album Eat to the Beat.  It is heard briefly during a scene of the 2006 film Silent Hill. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	1

It is about a man and a woman who take turns complimenting each other. The best selling version was Paul Whiteman's Victor single\, which made the top five. It was the most popular song from Anything Goes at the start with hundreds of parodies. The lyrics are particularly significant because they offer a snapshot as to what was highly prized in the mid-1930s\, and demonstrate Porter's rhyming ability Hal Kemp (March 27\, 1904 -- December 21\, 1940) was a jazz alto saxophonist\, clarinetist\, bandleader\, composer\, and arranger. He was born in Marion\, Alabama and died in Madera\, California following an auto accident. Art Jarrett took on leadership of Kemp's orchestra in 1941. His major recordings were "There's a Small Hotel"\, "Where or When"\, "This Year's Kisses"\, "When I'm With You"\, "Got a Date With an Angel" and "Three Little Fishies". On December 19\, 1940\, while driving from Los Angeles to a booking in San Francisco\, his car collided head-on with another. Kemp broke a leg and several ribs and suffered a punctured lung. He developed pneumonia while in the hospital and died two days later. Edgar Clyde "Skinnay" Ennis\, Jr. (August 13\, 1907 - June 3\, 1963) was an American jazz and pop music bandleader and singer. Ennis was born in Salisbury\, North Carolina and met Hal Kemp while attending the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill. He joined Kemp's orchestra as a drummer and vocalist in the late 1920s\, playing with him through 1937 including one tour of Europe in 1930. Following this Ennis put together his own band\, which became a popular ensemble in Hollywood films. "Got a Date With an Angel" was his theme song. During this time Gil Evans was one of his arrangers. He also did comedy routines\, and landed a job on Bob Hope's radio program from 1938 through 1946. He conducted his own service band during World War II and returned to Hollywood bandleading at the war's end. Toward the end of the 1950s Ennis's career had faded\, and he worked mostly in hotels in the Los Angeles area. He choked to death on a bone while eating dinner at a restaurant in Beverly Hills in 1963. COL channel name VAL warholsoup100	0

COL title VAL Everybody's Talkin' COL performer VAL Willie Nelson	COL video title VAL AC/DC Tribute - Leslie King - You Shook Me All Night Long COL description VAL From the cd Backed in Black. Acoustic versions with female voices.  ---  Female acoustic versions of AC/DC songs? Yes\, it's a gimmick\, but it works on its own terms. And it's a sweet irony\, considering AC/DC's music has always been macho\, swaggering boys' anthems. So what happens when you put an army of Lilith Fair-ready female artists to these tunes? Something pretty good\, actually. In fact\, the best track on here is the opener\, Sunny Hodge's unbelievably sweet\, feminine "Hells Bells". The original\, with its spare\, ominous electric guitar riff and slow grinding groove\, is the last song I'd expected to work in this context\, but Hodge turns the riff into an almost primitive-blues acoustic riff while her thin\, sweet voice turns the cock-rock lyrics into something so bizarre\, you just have to grin. Single-name artist Patty does a good job turning "Highway to Hell" into a country-rock busking tune (I've sung that song with this arrangement\, myself)\, and Leslie King is also great on "You Shook Me All Night Long". "Back in Black"\, though\, suffers from cover artist Reyo Bikkin's inability to hit those Brian Johnson high notes on the chorus\, rendering those feral "Back in black!" hooks rather flaccid.  Strange and weirdly interesting. My big gripe is that\, excluding the two "bonus tracks" ending the disc ("Highway to Hell" and "For Those about to Rock")\, they did every song off the Back in Black album\, thus rendering the song selection very limited. Imagined if they'd had someone do "Rising Power"\, "Thunderstruck" or "Let There Be Rock" with an acoustic guitar and female vocals!   Review written by D.

COL title VAL Fairytale of New York COL performer VAL Pilate	COL video title VAL Mr. Tambourine Man - Originally by Bob Dylan - Johnny Hates Jazz -  80´s Re:Covered COL description VAL Written by Bob Dylan. Included in the album ‘Bringing It All Back Home’. The Byrds recorded a version of the song and they released it that same year reaching #1 on both the US and the UK singles charts. The Byrds version was so influential that is recognized that it initiated the folk-rock sub-genre. Since the 60’s\, multiple artists including Stevie Wonder\, Judy Collins\, William Shatner and even Bob Sinclar have covered the song. The song appears twice on Rolling Stone’s list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All time. Bob Dylan’s version at #107 and The Byrds’ at #79. 80s RE:COVERED is an ambitious project that brings back to the studio\, the artists and producers who masterminded the most iconic hits of the decade\, this time to record a classic song from any other era\, produced in an 80’s style\, carefully chosen by the artist for this album. Every track is an exclusive and previously unreleased cover version!  • Kim Carnes\, passionately delivers the classic Rolling Stones number ”Under My thumb”. • Heaven 17 takes a unique spin on Elton John “Rocket Man” • ABC delivers the most touching rendition on Radiohead “High and Dry” • Wang Chung drives on to an angular version of Blur “Girls And Boys”. • Kim Wilde brilliant version of “Love Will Keep Us Together “ from Captain & Tennille  will definitely bring the 80's rushing back to you. • Belinda Carlisle\, emotionally delivers in her unique style\, a splendid cover of Credence “Have you ever seen the rain”. • Johnny Hates Jazz takes Mr. Tambourine Man from Bob Dylan on a dreamlike outing. • Samantha Fox shows an amazing vocal interpretation of Donna Summer “Hot Stuff”. • Black delivers a poignant and wonderful rendition on Chris Isaak “Wicked Game”. • China Crisis vocal melodies shine on the evergreen Carole King “It's Too Late”.   • Curiosity Killed The Cat adds their unique emotional warmth to the Doobie Brothers classic “Long Train Runnin'” • Go West delivers a great upbeat danceable version of Killers classic “Human”   Need we say more?  Their favorite songs\, recorded in their distinct sound\, to revive your passion.   80's Re:Covered  Welcome to the journey back. COL channel name VAL Music Brokers	0

COL title VAL Spinning Wheel COL performer VAL Phil Upchurch	COL video title VAL Freddie Taylor & Django Reinhardt - After You've Gone - 1936 May 4 - Gramophone\, Paris COL description VAL Django Reinhardt et le Quintette du Hot Club de France\, avec Stéphane Grappelli  Stéphane Grappelli (v);  Django Reinhardt (g solo);  Joseph Reinhardt\, Pierre "Baro" Ferret (g);  Lucien Simoens (b);  Freddy Taylor (vo)   After its initial recordings on Ultraphone and Decca\, the QHCF moved to the HMV label.  "After You've Gone" was recorded on their first session for the label and there seems to have been some growing pains. The balance is not as good as on the other labels\, with especially weak recording of the bass.  The opening chorus is by Grappelli this time around and he is immediately followed by the Louis Armstrong-inspired singing of Freddie Taylor. It seems that everyone is holding back in these opening choruses\, and sure enough\, as soon as Taylor is finished\, the intensity goes up as Django goes into a finger-busting chorus filled with fast arpeggios and runs\, and concluding with a chorded intro to Grappelli. The violinist takes charge\, building the intensity with every chorus. The breaks\, built into the tune at the end of each 16-bar section\, seem to have little effect on Taylor\, but each time Reinhardt and Grappelli hit them\, they add to the growing excitement of the recording.   1936 May 4 - Gramophone\, Paris COL channel name VAL Heinz Becker	0

Ring Of Fire  ------------------------  "Ring of Fire" or "The Ring of Fire" is a country music song popularized by Johnny Cash and co-written by June Carter (wife of Johnny Cash) and Merle Kilgore. The single appears on Cash's 1963 compilation album\, Ring of Fire: The Best of Johnny Cash. The song was originally recorded by June's sister\, Anita Carter\, on her Mercury Records album Folk Songs Old and New (1963) as "(Love's) Ring of Fire".  When the song failed to become a major hit for Anita\, Cash recorded it his own way\, adding the mariachi-style horns. This sound was later used in the song "It Ain't Me Babe"\, which was recorded around the same time. Mother Maybelle and the Carter sisters are prominently featured in the Cash recording singing harmony. Cash tinkered with a few of the original phrases in Anita Carter's version of the song:  Four years after the song was released\, Carter and Cash were married\, which Cash states helped to stop his alcohol and drug addictions. Cash's daughter Rosanne has stated\, "The song is about the transformative power of love and that's what it has always meant to me and that's what it will always mean to the Cash children.  The song was recorded on March 25\, 1963\, and became the biggest hit of Johnny Cash's career\, staying at number one on the charts for seven weeks.  Legacy  The most commercially successful cover version is by Social Distortion\, who released their punk rock version on the album Social Distortion (1990). The single reached #25 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks\, 27 years after the song was first recorded by Cash. Pop punk band Bowling for Soup would later cover the song on their live album Bowling for Soup: Live and Very Attractive.  The Eric Burdon & the Animals version\, recorded at the end of 1968\, charted in 1969 in the following countries: UK: #35\, GER: #24\, AUS: #10\, AU: #8\, NL: #4; it failed to chart in the US. In late 1974\, the Eric Burdon Band released a heavier version. In 2006\, Burdon performed the song sometimes at his concerts.  A cover of the song was released as a single by Alan Jackson on December 6\, 2010. His rendition of the song also features guest vocals from Lee Ann Womack. It peaked at #45\, becoming his first single to miss the Top 40 since "Blue Blooded Woman" also peaked at #45 in 1990.  Dwight Yoakam also recorded a version of the song\, on his debut album Guitars\, Cadillacs\, Etc.\, Etc.  The song was covered by Frank Zappa in the late 1980s\, and is offered on the 1995 The Best Band You Never Heard in Your Life. release showcasing a short-lived band lineup from a late-1988 tour. Zappa introduces the song by saying he'd met Johnny Cash that afternoon\, and that Johnny was going to come to the show and play with Zappa and his band\, but "his wife got sick." Zappa and the band proceed to play a seriously gonzo reggae version of the song\, with a caricature vocal impersonation of Johnny Cash. A euphemistic take on the song's title (meaning anal/rectal discomfort) permeates the song\, and a number of other numbers throughout the Best Band release. In the early 1980's\, the experimental/new wave band "Wall of Voodoo" (Mexican Radio) recorded a version of "Ring of Fire" that included extended guitar and synthesizer solos. This version of song can be found on the Wall of Voodoo compilation album "Grandma's House\," and can also be heard as background music in the adult film "Night Dreams." This version of the song also includes some slight rearrangement in so much as the repeating background music (layered behind the synth and lead guitar solos at the end of the song\,) borrows very heavily from the repeating incidental music in the "Flint" movies\, ("In Like Flint"\, "Our Man Flint\,") starring James Coburn.  The song is sung at the Molineux by the fans of Wolverhampton Wanderers  Use in media  "Ring of Fire" ranked #4 on CMT's 100 Greatest Songs in Country Music in 2003 and #87 on Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.  The song has also been featured in some video games: the original 1963 song was featured in Tony Hawk's Underground 2\, while a live version recorded in 1987 appeared in Guitar Hero 5 (which features a virtual avatar of Cash). The Social Distortion cover is a downloadable track for the Rock Band series (with the original song also confirmed for download in Rock Band 3) and is featured in Shaun White Snowboarding.  Blondie performed the song in the film Roadie (1980). The live recording was featured on the film soundtrack\, and on a reissue of the Blondie album Eat to the Beat.  It is heard briefly during a scene of the 2006 film Silent Hill. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

COL title VAL Mellow Down Easy COL performer VAL Jimmy Page & The Black Crowes	COL video title VAL Terry Knight and The Pack - I who have nothing (1966) COL description VAL Terry Knight and The Pack -  I who have nothing (1966) Un bel tuffo nel passato con la miglior cover (per me) di questo brano.  Su questo brano potranno scorrere fiumi d'inchiostro\,perchè la versione in inglese pare sia una sorta di plagio bello e buono di "Uno dei tanti" di Mogol e Carlo Donida uscito nel 1961 e portata al successo da Joe Sentieri\, quindi ben due anni prima di quella Ben.E. King che invece uscì nel 1963...  You know - everybody\, no matter who they are  And no matter how different they might be\,  Always runs across the same problem at least once  And that's the problem of love.  And maybe just once in your life\,  You're gonna fall in love with somebody so bad\,  And it's gonna be somebody that don't need you at all  Somebody that's got everything in the world there is to have  And you've got nothing.   I\, I who have nothing  I\, I who have no one  Adore you and love you so  I'm just a no one with nothing to give you but love  I love you   And then you guys\, you're gonna have to tell her something too  So you walk up to that girl and you sing\,   He\, he buys you diamonds  Bright\, sparkling diamonds  But believe me\, hear what I say  He can buy you the world but he'll never love the way  I love you   Listen here\, he can take you any place he wants  To fancy clubs and restaurants  While I can only watch you with  My nose pressed up against the window pane   If then\, just when you think that everything that you already love  Everything that you said has worth and find out that it didn't work at all  Yet when you're all alone you're gonna think about person that you loved so   Bad  Then you're gonna turn out the lights and you're gonna cry all to yourself   I\, I who have nothing  I\, I who have no one  Must watch you go dancing by  Wrapped in the arms of somebody else when darling\, it's I   Who loves you  Who loves you  Who loves you  Who loves you COL channel name VAL grease52	0

The band was originally formed in 1963 by guitarist Steve Fataar\, bassist Brother Fataar (real name Edries Fataar)\, drummer George Faber and guitarist Eugene Champion. However\, this line-up would only be together to record a couple of songs.

Blondie Chaplin then replaced Baby Duval in 1967. This was to be the line-up from 1967 until their demise as a group in 1970. In 1972 Ricky Fataar and Blondie Chaplin joined The Beach Boys.  This song is off the album "Burning Soul!" released in 1967. The song was written and first recorded by Chris Kenner in 1963\, but the best-known version was that by Wilson Pickett from 1966.

Goodnight and joy be with you all.  Oh\, if I had money enough to spend and leisure time to sit awhile There's a fair young man in this town that sorely has my heart beguiled His rosy cheeks and lovely lips\, alone he has my heart in thrall So fill to me the parting glass. Goodnight and joy be with you all.  Of all the comrades that here I've had\, they're sorry for my going away\, And of all the sweethearts that here I had\, they wish me one more day to stay\, But since it falls unto my lot that I should rise and you should not\, I will gently rise and softly call. Goodnight and joy be with you all. COL channel name VAL 92mystique	0

Feinstein\, accompanied by venerable GRAMMY® Award-winning jazz pianist Alan Broadbent (Charlie Haden\, Diana Krall\, Natalie Cole)\, puts his signature styling on a selection of holiday standards. Now available digitally and in retail stores nationwide\, these sought-after recordings were previously part of a limited release and out of print for over ten years.  No stranger to spreading holiday cheer\, Feinstein’s popular annual holiday concert in New York City is touted by the New York Times to be “as much a Christmas season ritual as catching the Rockettes at Radio City Music Hall or visiting the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree\,” making A Michael Feinstein Christmas a true gem for Feinstein fans as it is the only recorded collection of yuletide songs by the singer.  Long recognized as one of the world’s finest singers and pianists\, Feinstein is also celebrated for his tireless efforts to preserve\, protect and promote the songs and songwriters that shaped the Golden Age of American music. Feinstein founded the Great American Songbook Foundation\, which strives “to bring the music of the Great American Songbook to young people today and to preserve it for future generations.” The foundation is headquartered in Carmel\, Indiana at The Center for the Performing Arts\, where the Midwest-born Feinstein serves as Artistic Director.  Over the course of his non-stop\, 30-plus year career\, Michael Feinstein has wowed millions of fans with his cabaret and concert hall performances\, earned five GRAMMY® nominations\, two EMMY® nods\, and has released nearly an album a year—the majority of which pay tribute to his heroes—Frank Sinatra\, Jimmy Webb\, the Gershwins and  most recently\, André Previn\, with 2013’s Change of Heart: The Songs of André Previn on Concord Records. The prolific performer also hosts a nationally syndicated public radio show\, Song Travels\, and hosted the PBS show Michael Feinstein’s American Songbook. Last summer\, Michael was honored to be named the Principal Pops Conductor at the Pasadena POPS in Southern California\, where he will follow in the footsteps of the great Marvin Hamlisch—certainly a position in which Michael can continue to share his limitless passion for music with the world.

Lyrics: Well I heard there was a secret chord that David played and it pleased the Lord But you don't really care for music\, do ya? Well it goes like this : The fourth\, the fifth\, the minor fall and the major lift The baffled king composing Hallelujah  Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah...  Well your faith was strong but you needed proof You saw her bathing on the roof Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya And she tied you to her kitchen chair She broke your throne and she cut your hair And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah  Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah...  Yeah but Baby I've been here before I've seen this room and I've walked this floor\, (You know) I used to live alone before I knew ya And I've seen your flag on the marble arch and love is not a victory march It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah  Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah...  Well there was a time when you let me know What's really going on below But now you never show that to me do ya But remember when I moved in you And the holy dove was moving too And every breath we drew was Hallelujah  Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah  Hallelujah...  Maybe there's a God above But all I've ever learned from love Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya And it's not a cry that you hear at night It's not somebody who's seen the light It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah  Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelu...

COL title VAL Father & Son COL performer VAL Puggy	COL video title VAL Hard Hearted Hannah (HOT!) - Jeffries and his Rialto Orchestra COL description VAL It's not easy to find any '20's version of "Hard Hearted Hannah"  and this is one of the best. What makes this rendition special is the trumpet solo which I referred to in my introduction\, by Frank Guarente\, (from 2.07).  Guarente led the Georgians and toured Europe around this time. He was to be featured with the Savoy Orpheans later. Leslie Jeffries delivers this delightful tune with aplomb\, from October 1924\, when the 20's were beginning to roar.

COL title VAL Wave COL performer VAL Gal Costa	COL video title VAL Leslie West - Born To Be Wild.wmv COL description VAL Leslie West - Guitarded (2005) Releasing "all covers" albums can amount to either one of two things. Either the artist doing the covering is buying time between real albums or the artist doing the covering really wants to give some attention back to his musical heroes\, who helped shape his playing early on. Over the years\, former Mountain singer/guitarist Leslie West has recorded quite a few covers\, quite a few of which are featured on a 2005 release (that sported an un-PC title)\, Guitarded. Focusing on old blues numbers and rock tracks from the late '60s\, West proves that he can still let his fingers fly all these years later. Standouts here include a fine\, bluesy take of the Beatles' obscure "Old Brown Shoe\," as well as West covering an old Mountain tune (which late singer/bassist Felix Pappalardi sang originally)\, "Theme for an Imaginary Western." But now for the bad: how many more times can you hear a cover version of the Stones' "Honey Tonk Women" (hasn't every single bar band since the early '70s played this?)\, while an overhaul of Steppenwolf's "Born to Be Wild" (another classic rock tune that certainly doesn't need to be covered for the 50 zillionth time) falls flat. It has its moments\, but overall\, Guitarded will be of interest only to Leslie West fanatics.  Track Listing:  01. Allergic (Jon Tiven/Sally Tiven/Leslie West) - 4'19 02. Cross Cut Saw Blues (Hollins) - 4'07 03. Stormy Monday (Walker) - 7'09 04. Honky Tonk Women (Jagger/Richards) - 3'17 05. Hang Me Out To Dry (Leslie West/Jan Gillan) - 4'02 06.

She worked for a while in mail order houses and in other mercantile establishments before trying her hand at show business. Her first experiences with the stage were without any particular distinction and to make something happen she entered a beauty contest and won it.  The contest was won in Canada and those in the Dominion to whom it mattered much were somewhat chagrined when her birthplace was revealed.  That didn't matter to Miss Morgan; all that mattered was that she'd had her first break.    By the early 1920s she had firmly established her reputation as a top-flight night-club singer\, both in America and abroad. In Europe\, at a Command Performance before the Duke of Windsor (then the Prince of Wales)\, a member of the Royal household approached her and warned her not to sing any vulgar songs.  She replied\, "If I did\, you'd have to teach them to me."  Returning to the States after that triumphant European jaunt\, Miss Morgan appeared in "Show Boat"\, the Ferber-Kern masterpiece which was to become her most successful and famous venture.   Until her untimely death at the age of forty-one\, Helen Morgan graced many Broadway shows\, radio programs and Hollywood films. COL channel name VAL bsgs98	1

He was not only one of the most popular musicians to come out of the West Coast's "cool jazz" scene\, but also the possessor of a legendary and idiosyncratic wit. In addition to his work with Brubeck he led several of his own groups and did significant collaborations with artists such as Gerry Mulligan\, Jim Hall and Chet Baker. After years of chain smoking and general poor health\, Desmond succumbed to lung cancer in 1977 following one last tour with Brubeck. COL channel name VAL Ovidiu Temeo	0

That it is\, combining about a dozen of her early-'60s tracks for Highland and Brunswick -- the first of which were done with the Originals\, the later of which were done simply as Rosie -- with ten previously unissued tracks from a 1969 session. "Angel Baby" was a memorable\, unique single\, but Rosie Hamlin\, who wrote most of the material she recorded\, didn't have much else to offer as either a singer or songwriter. Most of her post-"Angel Baby" output was similar and inferior to that hit\, often so elementary in content as to be banal. These tracks laid out the same sort of doo wop/pop-rock ballads\, exploiting her propensity to hit high\, wordless notes that sounded a little like a record rotating at a slightly higher-than-normal speed. "Lonely Blue Nights\," her only record to chart (which it did\, lowly) besides "Angel Baby\," is here\, and is so close to "Angel Baby" in structure that one wonders why anyone would be surprised that it didn't rise any higher than #66. The 1969 sessions are mediocre updates of her transitional doo wop-to-girl group sound\, with more modern arrangements (noted session player Jerry Scheff is on bass) that mute whatever charm was heard on the early-'60s sides. As marginal enticements for serious collectors\, this includes the wholly uncharacteristic B-side of "Angel Baby\," a disorganized\, improvised R&B tune on which male R&B singer Bluford D. Wade (who wasn't in the Originals) takes lead vocals. There's also a different\, and worse\, alternate take of "Angel Baby" that was only issued in the U.K.  my name is Amnon from NYC.

COL title VAL You Must Believe in Spring COL performer VAL Bill Evans	COL video title VAL Aretha Franklin - Laughing on the Outside (Crying on the Inside) Columbia Records 1963 COL description VAL "Laughing on the Outside (Crying on the Inside)" is a popular song written by Bernie Wayne\, the lyrics by Ben Raleigh. The song was published in 1946.  Aretha Sings the Blues is a 1980 compilation of previously released Aretha Franklin recordings from Aretha's early 1960s tenure with Columbia Records.  Aretha Louise Franklin (March 25\, 1942 – August 16\, 2018) was an American singer and songwriter. Franklin began her career as a child singing gospel at New Bethel Baptist Church in Detroit\, where her father\, C. L. Franklin\, was minister. In 1960\, at the age of 18\, she embarked on a secular career\, recording for Columbia Records but only achieving modest success. Following her signing to Atlantic Records in 1967\, Franklin achieved commercial acclaim and success with songs such as "Respect"\, "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman"\, "Spanish Harlem" and "Think". By the end of the 1960s she had gained the title "The Queen of Soul".   Franklin eventually recorded a total of 112 charted singles on Billboard\, including 77 Hot 100 entries\, 17 top ten pop singles\, 100 R&B entries and 20 number-one R&B singles\, becoming the most charted female artist in the chart's history.   Franklin also recorded acclaimed albums such as I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You\, Lady Soul\, Young\, Gifted and Black and Amazing Grace before experiencing problems with her record company by the mid-1970s. After her father was shot in 1979\, Franklin left Atlantic and signed with Arista Records\, finding success with her part in the 1980 film The Blues Brothers and with the albums Jump to It (1982) and Who's Zoomin' Who? (1985).   In 1998\, Franklin won international acclaim for singing the opera aria "Nessun dorma"\, at the Grammys of that year replacing Luciano Pavarotti. Later that same year\, she scored her final Top 40 recording with "A Rose Is Still a Rose".   Franklin's other popular and well known hits include "Rock Steady"\, "Jump to It"\, "Freeway of Love"\, "Who's Zoomin' Who"\, "Chain Of Fools"\, "Until You Come Back to Me (That's What I'm Gonna Do)"\, "Something He Can Feel"\, "I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)" (with George Michael)\, and a remake of The Rolling Stones song "Jumpin' Jack Flash".   Franklin has won a total of 18 Grammy Awards and is one of the best-selling musical artists of all time\, having sold over 75 million records worldwide.  Franklin has been honored throughout her career including a 1987 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\, in which she became the first female performer to be inducted. She was inducted to the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. In August 2012\, Franklin was inducted into the GMA Gospel Music Hall of Fame.  Franklin is listed in at least two all-time lists on Rolling Stone magazine\, including the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time\, and the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time.  On August 13\, 2018\, Franklin was reported to be gravely ill at her home near Detroit. She was reported to be under hospice care and surrounded by friends and family. Stevie Wonder and Jesse Jackson\, among others\, had visited her. Franklin died at home in Detroit on August 16\, aged 76. The cause was reported to be advanced pancreatic cancer.

Acoustic versions with female voices.  ---  Female acoustic versions of AC/DC songs? Yes\, it's a gimmick\, but it works on its own terms. And it's a sweet irony\, considering AC/DC's music has always been macho\, swaggering boys' anthems. So what happens when you put an army of Lilith Fair-ready female artists to these tunes? Something pretty good\, actually. In fact\, the best track on here is the opener\, Sunny Hodge's unbelievably sweet\, feminine "Hells Bells". The original\, with its spare\, ominous electric guitar riff and slow grinding groove\, is the last song I'd expected to work in this context\, but Hodge turns the riff into an almost primitive-blues acoustic riff while her thin\, sweet voice turns the cock-rock lyrics into something so bizarre\, you just have to grin. Single-name artist Patty does a good job turning "Highway to Hell" into a country-rock busking tune (I've sung that song with this arrangement\, myself)\, and Leslie King is also great on "You Shook Me All Night Long". "Back in Black"\, though\, suffers from cover artist Reyo Bikkin's inability to hit those Brian Johnson high notes on the chorus\, rendering those feral "Back in black!" hooks rather flaccid.  Strange and weirdly interesting. My big gripe is that\, excluding the two "bonus tracks" ending the disc ("Highway to Hell" and "For Those about to Rock")\, they did every song off the Back in Black album\, thus rendering the song selection very limited. Imagined if they'd had someone do "Rising Power"\, "Thunderstruck" or "Let There Be Rock" with an acoustic guitar and female vocals!   Review written by D.

COL title VAL What Child Is This? COL performer VAL Demis Roussos	COL video title VAL AC/DC Tribute - Leslie King - You Shook Me All Night Long COL description VAL From the cd Backed in Black. Acoustic versions with female voices.  ---  Female acoustic versions of AC/DC songs? Yes\, it's a gimmick\, but it works on its own terms. And it's a sweet irony\, considering AC/DC's music has always been macho\, swaggering boys' anthems. So what happens when you put an army of Lilith Fair-ready female artists to these tunes? Something pretty good\, actually. In fact\, the best track on here is the opener\, Sunny Hodge's unbelievably sweet\, feminine "Hells Bells". The original\, with its spare\, ominous electric guitar riff and slow grinding groove\, is the last song I'd expected to work in this context\, but Hodge turns the riff into an almost primitive-blues acoustic riff while her thin\, sweet voice turns the cock-rock lyrics into something so bizarre\, you just have to grin. Single-name artist Patty does a good job turning "Highway to Hell" into a country-rock busking tune (I've sung that song with this arrangement\, myself)\, and Leslie King is also great on "You Shook Me All Night Long". "Back in Black"\, though\, suffers from cover artist Reyo Bikkin's inability to hit those Brian Johnson high notes on the chorus\, rendering those feral "Back in black!" hooks rather flaccid.  Strange and weirdly interesting. My big gripe is that\, excluding the two "bonus tracks" ending the disc ("Highway to Hell" and "For Those about to Rock")\, they did every song off the Back in Black album\, thus rendering the song selection very limited. Imagined if they'd had someone do "Rising Power"\, "Thunderstruck" or "Let There Be Rock" with an acoustic guitar and female vocals!   Review written by D.

COL title VAL You Ain't Going Nowhere COL performer VAL The Byrds	COL video title VAL Staccatos - You ain't going nowhere COL description VAL The Staccatos are a South African band formed in November 1961 by Brian Le Gassick. The original line-up consisted of Brian Le Gassick – lead vocals\, guitar\, John Leach – lead guitar\, Willie van der Walt – bass and Ian Miller – drums. In 1962 Leach and van der Walt were replaced by Richard Crouse – guitar\, Jimmy Routledge – bass and Billy Andrews – vocals\, harmonica (Billy later became one half of the duo the “Dream Merchants” with Billy Forrest). In 1964 the Staccatos won the Transvaal Merseyside Contest\, which included a recording contract with EMI. They supported Peter and Gordon on their tour of South Africa in 1965.  In 1966 Steve Lonsdale took over the lead vocals\, and Richard Crouse married Wanda Arletti who joined the group for a tour of Zambia. In 1967 Eddie Boyle – bass\, and Ronnie Cline – organ\, joined the group. In 1968 Billy Forrest approached the group to record “Cry to me” for the film “Katrina”. This song became their biggest hit\, reaching number 1 on the South African Top 20 in 1969 and charting for a massive 38 weeks\, earning them a double gold disc.  In 1969 John Elliot – sax\, joined the group and in 1970 Ivor Black – drums and Peter Vee – lead vocals (Steve Lonsdale left for America).  This song is off the album “Hear And Now” released in 1968. It was written by Bob Dylan in 1967\, but only released in September 1971 on the album "Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Vol II". COL channel name VAL keurspel (Leon Rossouw)	1

Blind since birth\, Kloss began playing professionally in Pittsburgh in the early '60s. He worked with Pat Martino in 1965\, the same year he started recording as a 16-year-old for Prestige. Through the years\, Kloss used such players on his records as Martino\, organist Don Patterson\, Jaki Byard\, Richard Davis\, Alan Dawson\, Cedar Walton\, Jimmy Owens\, Kenny Barron\, Jack DeJohnette\, Booker Ervin\, Chick Corea\, and Barry Miles\, in addition to collaborations with Richie Cole and duets with Gil Goldstein. But Eric Kloss seemed to disappear after his 1981 Omnisound album and has not been heard from by the jazz world in quite some time. --------------------------- I'll just add that Kloss is battling an illness these days...

COL title VAL Stuck on You COL performer VAL Wild Angels	COL video title VAL Nick Lucas - Tip-Toe Through the Tulips (VintageMusic.es) COL description VAL Nick Lucas (August 22\, 1897\, Newark\, New Jersey -- July 28\, 1982\, Colorado Springs\,Colorado) born Dominic Nicholas Anthony Lucanese was an American singer and pioneer jazz guitarist\, remembered as "the grandfather of the jazz guitar"\, whose peak of popularity lasted from the mid-1920s to the early 1930s. In 1922\, at the age of 25\, he gained renown with his hit renditions of "Picking the Guitar" and "Teasing the Frets" for Pathe Records. In 1923\, the Gibson Guitars proposed to build him a concert guitar with an extra deep body. Known as the "Nick Lucas Special\," it has been a popular model with guitarists since. In the same year\, he began a successful career in recording phonograph records for Brunswick and remained one of their exclusive artists until 1932. By the late 1920s\, Lucas had become well known as "The Crooning Troubadour" due to the success of the recordings he made for Brunswick Records. In 1929\, he co-starred in the Warner Brothers Technicolor musical\, Gold Diggers of Broadway\, in which he introduced the two hit songs "Painting the Clouds with Sunshine" and "Tiptoe Through the Tulips". The latter became Lucas' official theme song. The same year\, Lucas was also featured in the studio's all-star revue\, The Show of Shows. Lucas turned down Warner Bros.' seven-year contract offer\, which went instead to fellow crooner Dick Powell. In April 1930\, Warner Bros. bought Brunswick Records. Due to their appreciation of Nick Lucas\, Warner Bros. provided him with his own orchestra which was billed on his records as "The Crooning Troubadours". This arrangement lasted until December 1931\, when Warner Bros. licensed Brunswick to the American Record Corporation. The new owners were not as extravagant as Warner Bros. had previously been and Lucas lost his orchestra and eventually left Brunswick in 1932 to go freelance. He made two recordings for Durium Records in 1932 for their Hit of the Week series. These would prove to be his last major recordings. Nick Lucas spent the rest of his career performing on radio as well as in night clubs and dance halls. He made a number of recordings for various small or independent labels\, including Cavalier Records\, where he was billed as the "Cavalier Troubadour." In 1944 he reprised some of his old hits in Soundies movie musicals\, and filmed another group of songs for Snader Telescriptions in 1951. In 1974\, his renditions of the songs\, "I'm Gonna Charleston Back to Charleston"\, "When You and I Were Seventeen" and "Five Foot Two\, Eyes of Blue" were featured on the soundtrack of Paramount Pictures' The Great Gatsby (1974) with Robert Redford. An inspiration to Tiny Tim\, who made Lucas' "Tip-Toe Through the Tulips" (written November 1929) his own theme song\, Lucas became friends with the performer\, and on December 17\, 1969\, when Tiny Tim married Miss Vicki on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\, Lucas was there to sing their trademark song.  iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/es/album/the-singing-trobadour/id592376969 Síguenos en: Spotify: https://goo.gl/raouHQ Facebook: https://goo.gl/L92BHL Instagram: https://goo.gl/3oYDGH Web: http://www.vintagemusic.es   Compra nuestros Cd's en formato físico en estas plataformas: Ebay:  http://stores.ebay.com/VintageMusicFm BoutiqAlia: www.boutiqalia-vintagemusic.com Discogs: https://www.discogs.com/es/seller/vintagemusicfm/profile COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm	0

Ring Of Fire  ------------------------  "Ring of Fire" or "The Ring of Fire" is a country music song popularized by Johnny Cash and co-written by June Carter (wife of Johnny Cash) and Merle Kilgore. The single appears on Cash's 1963 compilation album\, Ring of Fire: The Best of Johnny Cash. The song was originally recorded by June's sister\, Anita Carter\, on her Mercury Records album Folk Songs Old and New (1963) as "(Love's) Ring of Fire".  When the song failed to become a major hit for Anita\, Cash recorded it his own way\, adding the mariachi-style horns. This sound was later used in the song "It Ain't Me Babe"\, which was recorded around the same time. Mother Maybelle and the Carter sisters are prominently featured in the Cash recording singing harmony. Cash tinkered with a few of the original phrases in Anita Carter's version of the song:  Four years after the song was released\, Carter and Cash were married\, which Cash states helped to stop his alcohol and drug addictions. Cash's daughter Rosanne has stated\, "The song is about the transformative power of love and that's what it has always meant to me and that's what it will always mean to the Cash children.  The song was recorded on March 25\, 1963\, and became the biggest hit of Johnny Cash's career\, staying at number one on the charts for seven weeks.  Legacy  The most commercially successful cover version is by Social Distortion\, who released their punk rock version on the album Social Distortion (1990). The single reached #25 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks\, 27 years after the song was first recorded by Cash. Pop punk band Bowling for Soup would later cover the song on their live album Bowling for Soup: Live and Very Attractive.  The Eric Burdon & the Animals version\, recorded at the end of 1968\, charted in 1969 in the following countries: UK: #35\, GER: #24\, AUS: #10\, AU: #8\, NL: #4; it failed to chart in the US. In late 1974\, the Eric Burdon Band released a heavier version. In 2006\, Burdon performed the song sometimes at his concerts.  A cover of the song was released as a single by Alan Jackson on December 6\, 2010. His rendition of the song also features guest vocals from Lee Ann Womack. It peaked at #45\, becoming his first single to miss the Top 40 since "Blue Blooded Woman" also peaked at #45 in 1990.  Dwight Yoakam also recorded a version of the song\, on his debut album Guitars\, Cadillacs\, Etc.\, Etc.  The song was covered by Frank Zappa in the late 1980s\, and is offered on the 1995 The Best Band You Never Heard in Your Life. release showcasing a short-lived band lineup from a late-1988 tour. Zappa introduces the song by saying he'd met Johnny Cash that afternoon\, and that Johnny was going to come to the show and play with Zappa and his band\, but "his wife got sick." Zappa and the band proceed to play a seriously gonzo reggae version of the song\, with a caricature vocal impersonation of Johnny Cash. A euphemistic take on the song's title (meaning anal/rectal discomfort) permeates the song\, and a number of other numbers throughout the Best Band release. In the early 1980's\, the experimental/new wave band "Wall of Voodoo" (Mexican Radio) recorded a version of "Ring of Fire" that included extended guitar and synthesizer solos. This version of song can be found on the Wall of Voodoo compilation album "Grandma's House\," and can also be heard as background music in the adult film "Night Dreams." This version of the song also includes some slight rearrangement in so much as the repeating background music (layered behind the synth and lead guitar solos at the end of the song\,) borrows very heavily from the repeating incidental music in the "Flint" movies\, ("In Like Flint"\, "Our Man Flint\,") starring James Coburn.  The song is sung at the Molineux by the fans of Wolverhampton Wanderers  Use in media  "Ring of Fire" ranked #4 on CMT's 100 Greatest Songs in Country Music in 2003 and #87 on Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.  The song has also been featured in some video games: the original 1963 song was featured in Tony Hawk's Underground 2\, while a live version recorded in 1987 appeared in Guitar Hero 5 (which features a virtual avatar of Cash). The Social Distortion cover is a downloadable track for the Rock Band series (with the original song also confirmed for download in Rock Band 3) and is featured in Shaun White Snowboarding.  Blondie performed the song in the film Roadie (1980). The live recording was featured on the film soundtrack\, and on a reissue of the Blondie album Eat to the Beat.  It is heard briefly during a scene of the 2006 film Silent Hill. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

L'auteur de L'écume des jours a su trouver les mots qui sonnent avec grâce. La direction musicale de Laurent De Wild est un "Voyage au Paradis".  Libération -- 2009 -- Bruno Pfeiffer -- Diane chante Vian tel que -- Un météore a explosé la surface tranquille de la lune : son dernier disque "Docteur Boris et Mister Vian". Le travail enduit de baume les oreilles\, puis le reste de la carcasse. C'est tout simplement extra... Un régal. Vian n'aurait sans doute pas hésité à applaudir « Rue de la flemme ». Quel concentré de swing relâché! Quel modèle de grande chanson (tour de force de la traduction)! Pourquoi  citer seulement  le savoureux « Voyage au Paradis » ? Les onze valent le coup. Le disque passe comme un remède à l'imbécillité de la période actuelle... La profondeur légère de l'interprétation s'offre comme un cadeau. Les chorus de Laurent de Wilde\, huit ou seize mesures maxi\, ne goinfrent pas la mise en place. La complicité de l'ensemble se ressent du respect flagrant que se portent les artistes. Le prochain qui me classe Diane Tell dans la variété\, je l'enjoins : jazzons les idées préconçues.

COL title VAL Autumn Leaves COL performer VAL Joe Morello	COL video title VAL Arnett Cobb  -  Blues In The Closet COL description VAL Track from Arnett Cobb - Party Time Label: Prestige Released ; 1959 Tenor saxophonist Arnett Cobb\, who was inactive between 1957 and 1958 due to a serious auto accident\, recorded three strong albums for Prestige during the first half of 1959. Party Time is the only one of the trio that features Cobb as the only horn and backed by a pianist (Ray Bryant) instead of an organ player with bassist Wendell Marshall\, drummer Art Taylor and Ray Barretto on conga completing the group\, most of the focus is on Cobb's tough yet flexible tenor. Such songs as "When My Dreamboat Comes Home\," "Blues in the Closet" and a remake of "Flying Home" make this the definitive Arnett Cobb album from the era. Highly recommended. ~ Scott Yanow  Arnett Cobb has that honking\, bar-walking saxophone sound that used to blast from jukeboxes coast-to-coast. There was always excitement elicited by Cobb’s uninhibited\, blasting style which earned him the label “Wild Man of the Tenor Sax.” ( Leo T.

COL title VAL Fire and Rain COL performer VAL Maynard Ferguson	COL video title VAL Aretha Franklin - Laughing on the Outside (Crying on the Inside) Columbia Records 1963 COL description VAL "Laughing on the Outside (Crying on the Inside)" is a popular song written by Bernie Wayne\, the lyrics by Ben Raleigh. The song was published in 1946.  Aretha Sings the Blues is a 1980 compilation of previously released Aretha Franklin recordings from Aretha's early 1960s tenure with Columbia Records.  Aretha Louise Franklin (March 25\, 1942 – August 16\, 2018) was an American singer and songwriter. Franklin began her career as a child singing gospel at New Bethel Baptist Church in Detroit\, where her father\, C. L. Franklin\, was minister. In 1960\, at the age of 18\, she embarked on a secular career\, recording for Columbia Records but only achieving modest success. Following her signing to Atlantic Records in 1967\, Franklin achieved commercial acclaim and success with songs such as "Respect"\, "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman"\, "Spanish Harlem" and "Think". By the end of the 1960s she had gained the title "The Queen of Soul".   Franklin eventually recorded a total of 112 charted singles on Billboard\, including 77 Hot 100 entries\, 17 top ten pop singles\, 100 R&B entries and 20 number-one R&B singles\, becoming the most charted female artist in the chart's history.   Franklin also recorded acclaimed albums such as I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You\, Lady Soul\, Young\, Gifted and Black and Amazing Grace before experiencing problems with her record company by the mid-1970s. After her father was shot in 1979\, Franklin left Atlantic and signed with Arista Records\, finding success with her part in the 1980 film The Blues Brothers and with the albums Jump to It (1982) and Who's Zoomin' Who? (1985).   In 1998\, Franklin won international acclaim for singing the opera aria "Nessun dorma"\, at the Grammys of that year replacing Luciano Pavarotti. Later that same year\, she scored her final Top 40 recording with "A Rose Is Still a Rose".   Franklin's other popular and well known hits include "Rock Steady"\, "Jump to It"\, "Freeway of Love"\, "Who's Zoomin' Who"\, "Chain Of Fools"\, "Until You Come Back to Me (That's What I'm Gonna Do)"\, "Something He Can Feel"\, "I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)" (with George Michael)\, and a remake of The Rolling Stones song "Jumpin' Jack Flash".   Franklin has won a total of 18 Grammy Awards and is one of the best-selling musical artists of all time\, having sold over 75 million records worldwide.  Franklin has been honored throughout her career including a 1987 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\, in which she became the first female performer to be inducted. She was inducted to the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. In August 2012\, Franklin was inducted into the GMA Gospel Music Hall of Fame.  Franklin is listed in at least two all-time lists on Rolling Stone magazine\, including the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time\, and the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time.  On August 13\, 2018\, Franklin was reported to be gravely ill at her home near Detroit. She was reported to be under hospice care and surrounded by friends and family. Stevie Wonder and Jesse Jackson\, among others\, had visited her. Franklin died at home in Detroit on August 16\, aged 76. The cause was reported to be advanced pancreatic cancer.

Fängt sie dich mit den Augen  und trinkt dich langsam leer sie spielt schon so perfekt\,  als ob sie Bette Davis wär.  Oh sie liebt dich\, sie besiegt dich kennt dich übermorgen doch nicht. Ganz unschuldig lacht sie und zählt dich aus oh du kennst die Tricks nicht. Ihr zu widerstehen fällt dir schwer als ob sie Bette Davis wär.  Sie nimmt dich mit nach Haus und ihrem Garbo-Charme läufst du blind hinterher  als ob sie Bette Davis wär. Sie macht den Clown aus dir zwingt dich auf die Knie. Sie macht das ganz leger  als ob sie Bette Davis wär.  Oh sie liebt dich\, sie besiegt dich kennt dich übermorgen doch nicht. Ganz unschuldig lacht sie und zählt dich aus oh du kennst die Tricks nicht. Ihr zu widerstehen fällt dir schwer als ob sie Bette Davis wär.

COL title VAL Streets of Philadelphia COL performer VAL Molly Johnson	COL video title VAL Dionne Warwick Do You Know the Way to San Jose 1968 International Smash COL description VAL Dionne Warwick's 1968 million selling Grammy winning international smash hit the Billboard Top 10 in May 1968\, Record World Top 40 at #8 and was also a UK smash at #8. The flip side "Let Me Be Lonely" also written by Bacharach and David also hit the Billboard Hot 100\, one of many double sided hits Dionne recorded on Florence Greenberg's Scepter label. Dionne charted an astonishing eight Billboard Top Twenty hits in less than 30 months: Alfie-#15 July 67; I Say A Little Prayer-Nov 67-#4; Theme From Valley of the Dolls-Feb 68-#2 (4 weeks); Do You Know the Way to San Jose-May 68-#10; Promises\, Promises-Oct 1968-#19; This Girl's In Love With You-March 1969-#7; You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling-#15-Sept 69; I'll Never Fall In Love Again-Jan 70-#6. In addition\, Warwick hit the Top 40 in the same time period with Windows of the World-Sept 67\, Who Is Gonna Love Me-July 68\, and The April Fools-July 69. In 1969 Dionne was the first African-American Female Vocalist to win in the Grammy category Best Contemporary-Pop Vocal Performance\, Female for Do You Know the Way to San Jose. "San Jose" was also used as the theme in Dodge automobile commercials in 1968 and 1969\, for the Charger and the Challenger. "Do You Know the Way to San Jose" became "Dodge Is Turning Up the Fever Now"! Another note of trivia: the background vocalists for this session were Valerie Simpson (Ashford & Simpson)\, Cissy Houston and DeeDee Warwick.  Writes Nick Tosches\, the renowned writer\, music journalist\, novelist\, biographer and poet in the January 7\, 1972 issue of the rock magazine FUSION; ".getting into Dionne Warwick is like finding buried treasure. The Bacharach/David repertoire which milady chooses to sing is so fascinatingly cynical / fatalistic / stoical / emotional / happy\, simultaneously! It's pure emotion. There is a whole lot more to emotion than some rock punk bursting his dexedrine-staved blood vessels by screaming "Baby I need you baby" into a microphone. Dionne Warwick is not a rock and roll singer. She's not a jazz singer either. Rhythm and blues? Nope. A pop singer? No way. Did you ever tongue-kiss with someone who barfed a Singapore Sling bolus into your mouth\, and then four years later you're with someone else and you feel good and you realize how beautiful it all was and then it's all melancholy/happiness\, sort of? That's the kind of singer Dionne Warwick is. She's beautiful. Dionne\, paired with Bacharach's string/horn/reed arrangements\, comes up as a lyric mezzo-sopranoid par-excellence\, melodious/expressiveness-wise. If you've never gotten into her\, you ought to. Get hep to Dionne Warwick. For your own sake." COL channel name VAL dibotis	0

Goodnight and joy be with you all.  Oh\, if I had money enough to spend and leisure time to sit awhile There's a fair young man in this town that sorely has my heart beguiled His rosy cheeks and lovely lips\, alone he has my heart in thrall So fill to me the parting glass. Goodnight and joy be with you all.  Of all the comrades that here I've had\, they're sorry for my going away\, And of all the sweethearts that here I had\, they wish me one more day to stay\, But since it falls unto my lot that I should rise and you should not\, I will gently rise and softly call.

COL title VAL The Three Bells COL performer VAL Nana Mouskouri	COL video title VAL Billy Eckstine -- I Could Write a Book COL description VAL Billy Eckstine (Pittsburgh\, 8 de julio de 1914 - Pittsburgh\, 8 de marzo de 1993) fue un cantante estadounidense de jazz y música pop. Poseedor de una voz de barítono\, fue durante los años cuarenta una figura carismática de la música popular negra\, al liderar una de las primeras big band de bop y convertirse en el primer cantante negro de baladas románticas (fue llamado el Sinatra negro). Con el paso de los años\, su influencia ha sido considerable en el ámbito del soul y el rhythm and blues.  Eckstine comenzó a cantar a los nueve años y participó en numerosos espectáculos para aficionados. Aunque su vocación había sido la de jugador de fútbol americano\, una grave lesión lo recondujo hacia el mundo de la música. Tras diversos trabajos al oeste de Chicago a finales de los años treinta\, Eckstine fue invitado por Earl Hines para unirse a su Grand Terrace Orchestra en 1939.  Aunque sus primeros éxitos fueron canciones triviales como "Jelly\, Jelly" y "The Jitney Man"\, grabó también varios estándares como "Stormy Monday". Hacia 1943\, se acompañaba de estrellas como Dizzy Gillespie\, Charlie Parker y Sarah Vaughan. Tras formar su propia banda ese año\, contrató a los tres y gradualmente se hizo con más figuras modernas y con futuras estrellas: Wardell Gray\, Dexter Gordon\, Miles Davis\, Kenny Dorham\, Fats Navarro y Art Blakey\, así como con arreglistas como Tadd Dameron y Gil Fuller. La Billy Eckstine Orchestra fue la primera big band bop\, y su líder reflejaba las innovaciones bop adaptando sus armonías vocales a las baladas normales. A pesar del matiz moderno del grupo\, Eckstine encabezó las listas frecuentemente a mediados de los cuarenta\, con temas como "A Cottage for Sale" y "Prisoner of Love". En las giras por Europa y América\, el cantante tocaba también la trompeta\, el trombón de válvulas y la guitarra.  Forzado a disolver la orquesta en 1947 tras haber formado la suya propia Gillespie\, Eckstine realizó una transición hacia un estilo más baladístico y con arreglos de cuerda. Grabó más de una docena de éxitos a finales de los cuarenta\, entre lo que se incluyen "My Foolish Heart" y "I Apologize". Se hizo popular en Gran Bretaña\, obteniendo un gran éxito durante los cincuenta con temas como "No One But You" y "Gigi"\, así como con sus dúos con Sarah Vaughan. Eckstine regresaría a sus raíces jazzísticas ocasionalmente\, grabando con Vaughan\, Count Basie y Quincy Jones\, y grabando un LP en directo\, No Cover\, No Minimum\, en el que interpretaba algunos solos de trompeta. Grabó varios discos para Mercury y Roulette a comienzos de los sesenta y publicó en Motown algunos discos de estándares a mediados de esa década. Tras grabar muy espaciadamente en los setenta\, Eckstine hizo su última grabación (Billy Eckstine Sings with Benny Carter) en 1986. Murió por un ataque al corazón en 1993.

COL title VAL Take It Easy COL performer VAL Søren Sko	COL video title VAL The Tennessee Tooters - "How Come You Do Me Like You Do?" (1925) COL description VAL Here is a great jazz record made by a group contracted by pianist Rube Bloom\, recorded Jan. 23\, 1925.  The personnel on this record is somewhat controversial - Rust's Jazz Records lists Red Nichols on trumpet and Miff Mole on trombone\, but Red and Miff both stated that they did not record together until six months later.  My ears tell me that the trombonist is Miff Mole\, but there is no trumpet solo so it is impossible to say whether the trumpet is Red Nichols.  The flip side of the record ("Hot-Hot-Hottentot") contains trumpet work that sounds very much like Red\, but no trombone solo!    The rest of the band is Chuck Miller\, alto sax; Lucien Smith\, tenor sax;  Rube Bloom\, piano; John Cali\, banjo; Joe Tarto\, tuba; Harry Lottman\, drums.  Nearly identical personnel to The Cotton Pickers\, another group contracted to Brunswick/Vocalion records by Rube Bloom.  Played back on a Victor Orthophonic Victrola\, Mode. 4-4E\, the "Granada"\, circa 1926.  This model was equipped with the special Orthophonic diaphragm and soundbox that was specifically designed to play back electrically recorded phonograph records.  But it also came equipped with an electric motor instead of a spring would mechanism.  A medium tone phonograph needle was used for playback\, and the Victrola horn was recorded using a Shure SM571 compact dynamic microphone. COL channel name VAL Michael Laprarie	0

Lyrics: Well I heard there was a secret chord that David played and it pleased the Lord But you don't really care for music\, do ya? Well it goes like this : The fourth\, the fifth\, the minor fall and the major lift The baffled king composing Hallelujah  Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah...  Well your faith was strong but you needed proof You saw her bathing on the roof Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya And she tied you to her kitchen chair She broke your throne and she cut your hair And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah  Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah...  Yeah but Baby I've been here before I've seen this room and I've walked this floor\, (You know) I used to live alone before I knew ya And I've seen your flag on the marble arch and love is not a victory march It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah  Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah...  Well there was a time when you let me know What's really going on below But now you never show that to me do ya But remember when I moved in you And the holy dove was moving too And every breath we drew was Hallelujah  Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah  Hallelujah...  Maybe there's a God above But all I've ever learned from love Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya And it's not a cry that you hear at night It's not somebody who's seen the light It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah  Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelu...

Composed by John Barry and with lyrics by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley\, the song was performed by Shirley Bassey for the film's opening and closing title sequences\, as well as the soundtrack album release. The single release of the song gave Bassey her only Billboard Hot 100 top forty hit\, peaking in the Top 10 at number eight and at number two for four weeks on the Adult Contemporary chart\, and in the United Kingdom the single reached number 21.  The song finished at #53 in AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs survey of top tunes in American cinema. In 2008\, the single was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.  Other versions and adaptations  Recorded covers  In 1964\, Billy Strange recorded a version\, which even charted along with Bassey's original. In 1965\, The Honeycombs did an instrumental cover of it on their Japanese tour which also appeared on their album In Tokyo which was released in Japan only. In 1965\, Count Basie did an instrumental version of the song on his album Basie Meets Bond. In 1965\, Ray Barretto did an instrumental version of the song on his album Señor 007. In 1965\, Billy Preston did an instrumental version of the song on his album Early Hits Of 1965. In 1967\, Eino Grön recorded the Finnish rendering "Hän Vaatii" ("He Required") for his self-titled album. In 1978\, the song was covered by Howard Devoto's post-punk band Magazine\, as the B-side to their single Touch and Go. In 1996\, Man Or Astroman? did an instrumental version of the song on the various-artists comp Secret Agent S.O.U.N.D.S.. In 2000\, Hank Marvin did an instrumental version of the song on his album Marvin at the Movies. In 2006\, it was covered in a heavy metal fashion by Finnish rock group Leningrad Cowboys on their album Zombies Paradise. In 2012\, for the James Bond video game 007 Legends\, an instrumental version was written and composed by David Arnold for the main title sequence\, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the film franchise.  Live and televised performances  In 1980\, Shirley Bassey performed the song on The Muppet Show. In 1997\, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers covered the song in concert\, and it is featured on their career-spanning live set\, The Live Anthology. In 2011\, Céline Dion included the song as part of a "James Bond Medley" in her Las Vegas show Celine. In 2013\, Shirley Bassey sang the song at the Academy Awards in tribute to the 50 years of James Bonds films. Bassey received a standing ovation after her performance.  Soundtrack appearances  In 1998\, the song was to feature prominently in the film Little Voice\, appearing in much the manner of its first use – but with Michael Caine slamming the door that becomes the song's first chord blast\, rather than\, of course\, Sean Connery. In 1999\, in the "Shutout In Seattle" episode of US sitcom Frasier\, the song is featured in the final scene\, with Frasier Crane\, Niles Crane and Martin Crane singing along to a piano accompaniment. The song is sung at Jordan Belfort's wedding in the 2013 film The Wolf of Wall Street.  Remixes and examples  In 2000\, the song was remixed by Propellerheads for the album Diamonds are Forever: The Shirley Bassey Remix Album. In 2007\, it was sampled by reggaeton artist Tego Calderón on his song "Alegría"\, off of his album El Abayarde Contraataca.  Parodies  Parodies of the song include "Dr. Evil"\, written by They Might Be Giants for Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me\, and "Max Power"\, from the The Simpsons episode "Homer to the Max".  Inspired songs  In 1989\, after the release of the James Bond theme song "Licence to Kill"\, from the film of the same title\, it was felt to significantly reuse important elements of "Goldfinger"\, and so the songwriting credits for the former were adapted for all subsequent releases.

COL title VAL After You've Gone COL performer VAL Sue Keller	COL video title VAL Freddie Taylor & Django Reinhardt - After You've Gone - 1936 May 4 - Gramophone\, Paris COL description VAL Django Reinhardt et le Quintette du Hot Club de France\, avec Stéphane Grappelli  Stéphane Grappelli (v);  Django Reinhardt (g solo);  Joseph Reinhardt\, Pierre "Baro" Ferret (g);  Lucien Simoens (b);  Freddy Taylor (vo)   After its initial recordings on Ultraphone and Decca\, the QHCF moved to the HMV label.  "After You've Gone" was recorded on their first session for the label and there seems to have been some growing pains. The balance is not as good as on the other labels\, with especially weak recording of the bass.  The opening chorus is by Grappelli this time around and he is immediately followed by the Louis Armstrong-inspired singing of Freddie Taylor. It seems that everyone is holding back in these opening choruses\, and sure enough\, as soon as Taylor is finished\, the intensity goes up as Django goes into a finger-busting chorus filled with fast arpeggios and runs\, and concluding with a chorded intro to Grappelli. The violinist takes charge\, building the intensity with every chorus. The breaks\, built into the tune at the end of each 16-bar section\, seem to have little effect on Taylor\, but each time Reinhardt and Grappelli hit them\, they add to the growing excitement of the recording.   1936 May 4 - Gramophone\, Paris COL channel name VAL Heinz Becker	1

Blind since birth\, Kloss began playing professionally in Pittsburgh in the early '60s. He worked with Pat Martino in 1965\, the same year he started recording as a 16-year-old for Prestige. Through the years\, Kloss used such players on his records as Martino\, organist Don Patterson\, Jaki Byard\, Richard Davis\, Alan Dawson\, Cedar Walton\, Jimmy Owens\, Kenny Barron\, Jack DeJohnette\, Booker Ervin\, Chick Corea\, and Barry Miles\, in addition to collaborations with Richie Cole and duets with Gil Goldstein. But Eric Kloss seemed to disappear after his 1981 Omnisound album and has not been heard from by the jazz world in quite some time. --------------------------- I'll just add that Kloss is battling an illness these days...

COL title VAL I'm Only Sleeping COL performer VAL Rosanne Cash	COL video title VAL Billy Eckstine -- Stranger in Paradise COL description VAL Billy Eckstine (Pittsburgh\, 8 de julio de 1914 - Pittsburgh\, 8 de marzo de 1993) fue un cantante estadounidense de jazz y música pop. Poseedor de una voz de barítono\, fue durante los años cuarenta una figura carismática de la música popular negra\, al liderar una de las primeras big band de bop y convertirse en el primer cantante negro de baladas románticas (fue llamado el Sinatra negro). Con el paso de los años\, su influencia ha sido considerable en el ámbito del soul y el rhythm and blues.  Eckstine comenzó a cantar a los nueve años y participó en numerosos espectáculos para aficionados. Aunque su vocación había sido la de jugador de fútbol americano\, una grave lesión lo recondujo hacia el mundo de la música. Tras diversos trabajos al oeste de Chicago a finales de los años treinta\, Eckstine fue invitado por Earl Hines para unirse a su Grand Terrace Orchestra en 1939.  Aunque sus primeros éxitos fueron canciones triviales como "Jelly\, Jelly" y "The Jitney Man"\, grabó también varios estándares como "Stormy Monday". Hacia 1943\, se acompañaba de estrellas como Dizzy Gillespie\, Charlie Parker y Sarah Vaughan. Tras formar su propia banda ese año\, contrató a los tres y gradualmente se hizo con más figuras modernas y con futuras estrellas: Wardell Gray\, Dexter Gordon\, Miles Davis\, Kenny Dorham\, Fats Navarro y Art Blakey\, así como con arreglistas como Tadd Dameron y Gil Fuller. La Billy Eckstine Orchestra fue la primera big band bop\, y su líder reflejaba las innovaciones bop adaptando sus armonías vocales a las baladas normales. A pesar del matiz moderno del grupo\, Eckstine encabezó las listas frecuentemente a mediados de los cuarenta\, con temas como "A Cottage for Sale" y "Prisoner of Love". En las giras por Europa y América\, el cantante tocaba también la trompeta\, el trombón de válvulas y la guitarra.  Forzado a disolver la orquesta en 1947 tras haber formado la suya propia Gillespie\, Eckstine realizó una transición hacia un estilo más baladístico y con arreglos de cuerda. Grabó más de una docena de éxitos a finales de los cuarenta\, entre lo que se incluyen "My Foolish Heart" y "I Apologize". Se hizo popular en Gran Bretaña\, obteniendo un gran éxito durante los cincuenta con temas como "No One But You" y "Gigi"\, así como con sus dúos con Sarah Vaughan. Eckstine regresaría a sus raíces jazzísticas ocasionalmente\, grabando con Vaughan\, Count Basie y Quincy Jones\, y grabando un LP en directo\, No Cover\, No Minimum\, en el que interpretaba algunos solos de trompeta. Grabó varios discos para Mercury y Roulette a comienzos de los sesenta y publicó en Motown algunos discos de estándares a mediados de esa década. Tras grabar muy espaciadamente en los setenta\, Eckstine hizo su última grabación (Billy Eckstine Sings with Benny Carter) en 1986. Murió por un ataque al corazón en 1993.

COL title VAL Body and Soul COL performer VAL Maria Augusta	COL video title VAL Helen Morgan - Body and Soul (1930) COL description VAL "Body and Soul" Words and Music by Edward Heyman\, Robert Sour\, Frank Eyton and John Green Performed by Helen Morgan with orchestra conducted by Leonard Joy Recorded September 12\, 1930\, New York  Helen Morgan (1900 - 1941) was born in Danville\, Illinois.  She worked for a while in mail order houses and in other mercantile establishments before trying her hand at show business. Her first experiences with the stage were without any particular distinction and to make something happen she entered a beauty contest and won it.  The contest was won in Canada and those in the Dominion to whom it mattered much were somewhat chagrined when her birthplace was revealed.  That didn't matter to Miss Morgan; all that mattered was that she'd had her first break.    By the early 1920s she had firmly established her reputation as a top-flight night-club singer\, both in America and abroad. In Europe\, at a Command Performance before the Duke of Windsor (then the Prince of Wales)\, a member of the Royal household approached her and warned her not to sing any vulgar songs.  She replied\, "If I did\, you'd have to teach them to me."  Returning to the States after that triumphant European jaunt\, Miss Morgan appeared in "Show Boat"\, the Ferber-Kern masterpiece which was to become her most successful and famous venture.   Until her untimely death at the age of forty-one\, Helen Morgan graced many Broadway shows\, radio programs and Hollywood films. COL channel name VAL bsgs98	1

COL title VAL Killer Queen COL performer VAL Sum 41	COL video title VAL Billy Eckstine -- Stranger in Paradise COL description VAL Billy Eckstine (Pittsburgh\, 8 de julio de 1914 - Pittsburgh\, 8 de marzo de 1993) fue un cantante estadounidense de jazz y música pop. Poseedor de una voz de barítono\, fue durante los años cuarenta una figura carismática de la música popular negra\, al liderar una de las primeras big band de bop y convertirse en el primer cantante negro de baladas románticas (fue llamado el Sinatra negro). Con el paso de los años\, su influencia ha sido considerable en el ámbito del soul y el rhythm and blues.  Eckstine comenzó a cantar a los nueve años y participó en numerosos espectáculos para aficionados. Aunque su vocación había sido la de jugador de fútbol americano\, una grave lesión lo recondujo hacia el mundo de la música. Tras diversos trabajos al oeste de Chicago a finales de los años treinta\, Eckstine fue invitado por Earl Hines para unirse a su Grand Terrace Orchestra en 1939.  Aunque sus primeros éxitos fueron canciones triviales como "Jelly\, Jelly" y "The Jitney Man"\, grabó también varios estándares como "Stormy Monday". Hacia 1943\, se acompañaba de estrellas como Dizzy Gillespie\, Charlie Parker y Sarah Vaughan. Tras formar su propia banda ese año\, contrató a los tres y gradualmente se hizo con más figuras modernas y con futuras estrellas: Wardell Gray\, Dexter Gordon\, Miles Davis\, Kenny Dorham\, Fats Navarro y Art Blakey\, así como con arreglistas como Tadd Dameron y Gil Fuller. La Billy Eckstine Orchestra fue la primera big band bop\, y su líder reflejaba las innovaciones bop adaptando sus armonías vocales a las baladas normales. A pesar del matiz moderno del grupo\, Eckstine encabezó las listas frecuentemente a mediados de los cuarenta\, con temas como "A Cottage for Sale" y "Prisoner of Love". En las giras por Europa y América\, el cantante tocaba también la trompeta\, el trombón de válvulas y la guitarra.  Forzado a disolver la orquesta en 1947 tras haber formado la suya propia Gillespie\, Eckstine realizó una transición hacia un estilo más baladístico y con arreglos de cuerda. Grabó más de una docena de éxitos a finales de los cuarenta\, entre lo que se incluyen "My Foolish Heart" y "I Apologize". Se hizo popular en Gran Bretaña\, obteniendo un gran éxito durante los cincuenta con temas como "No One But You" y "Gigi"\, así como con sus dúos con Sarah Vaughan. Eckstine regresaría a sus raíces jazzísticas ocasionalmente\, grabando con Vaughan\, Count Basie y Quincy Jones\, y grabando un LP en directo\, No Cover\, No Minimum\, en el que interpretaba algunos solos de trompeta. Grabó varios discos para Mercury y Roulette a comienzos de los sesenta y publicó en Motown algunos discos de estándares a mediados de esa década. Tras grabar muy espaciadamente en los setenta\, Eckstine hizo su última grabación (Billy Eckstine Sings with Benny Carter) en 1986. Murió por un ataque al corazón en 1993.

Levy B3 B.B. Written-By -- H.B. Barnum B4 White Daisies Written-By -- David McCallum B5 Oh My! Written-By -- David Axlerod  ------------------------  "Mellow Yellow" is a song and single release by Donovan. It reached #2 on the Billboard charts in the U.S. in 1966 and #8 in the UK in early 1967.  The song was rumored to be about smoking dried banana skins\, which was believed to be a hallucinogenic drug in the 1960s\, though this aspect of bananas has since been debunked. According to Donovan's notes accompanying the album Donovan's Greatest Hits\, the rumor that one could get high from smoking dried banana skins was started by Country Joe McDonald in 1966\, and Donovan heard the rumor three weeks before "Mellow Yellow" was released as a single. (According to The Rolling Stone Illustrated Encyclopedia of Rock and Roll\, he admitted later the song made reference to a vibrator; an "electrical banana" as mentioned in the lyrics.) The phrase "mellow yellow" appears on page 719 of the first American edition of James Joyce's Ulysses\, where it is used to refer to Mrs. Marion Bloom's buttocks\, but it is not known if Donovan got the phrase from there.  The record had a "Beatlesque" feel to it\, and was sometimes mistaken for a Beatles song. Donovan\, in fact\, was friends with the Beatles. Paul McCartney can be heard as one of the background revelers on this track\, but contrary to popular belief\, it is not McCartney whispering the "quite rightly" answering lines in the chorus\, but rather Donovan himself. Donovan had a small part in coming up with the lyrics for "Yellow Submarine"\, and McCartney played bass guitar (uncredited) on portions of Donovan's Mellow Yellow album.  Covers  R&B and jazz singer Georgie Fame recorded his own version with a distinctively different arrangement reminiscent of the Count Basie orchestra.  Charly B. also covered the song in 1983\, in Italo disco style.  In 1999\, "Mellow Yellow" was sung by a group of young adults\, among whom were then-unknowns Alex Greenwald\, Rashida Jones and Jason Thompson\, in Gap's "Everybody in Cords" commercial directed by Pedro Romhanyi. The music mix was done by the Dust Brothers.  In 2011\, the song was featured in a new commercial for Mello Yello drink\, as part of Coca-Cola's "Original Smooth" campaign to rebrand and reintroduce the drink. Also\, the song itself was covered by Family of the Year featuring Donovan. The version is available for download on the Mello Yello website.  Other adaptations  Cadbury used a modified version of the song to promote their Caramello Koala chocolates ("They call me Caramello ... Koala").  The song was also used in a series of television commercials to promote the use of butter.  In France\, Lipton used a modified version of the song to promote their tea ("They call me Lipton Yellow").  One of the oldest coffeeshops in Amsterdam is called "Mellow Yellow".  In episode 17 of the 5th season of Scrubs\, JD figures out the song is about jaundice (not quite rightly).  Jimi Hendrix made a reference to this song in his song "Bold As Love".  Frank Zappa referenced the song in his number "Absolutely Free" on the album We're Only In It For The Money (1967). COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	1

COL title VAL Hey There COL performer VAL The Johnston Brothers with Johnny Douglas and His Orchestra	COL video title VAL Hal Kemp Skinnay Ennis - You're the Top 1934 - Cole Porter COL description VAL "You're The Top" is a Cole Porter song from the 1934 musical Anything Goes. It is about a man and a woman who take turns complimenting each other. The best selling version was Paul Whiteman's Victor single\, which made the top five. It was the most popular song from Anything Goes at the start with hundreds of parodies. The lyrics are particularly significant because they offer a snapshot as to what was highly prized in the mid-1930s\, and demonstrate Porter's rhyming ability Hal Kemp (March 27\, 1904 -- December 21\, 1940) was a jazz alto saxophonist\, clarinetist\, bandleader\, composer\, and arranger. He was born in Marion\, Alabama and died in Madera\, California following an auto accident. Art Jarrett took on leadership of Kemp's orchestra in 1941. His major recordings were "There's a Small Hotel"\, "Where or When"\, "This Year's Kisses"\, "When I'm With You"\, "Got a Date With an Angel" and "Three Little Fishies". On December 19\, 1940\, while driving from Los Angeles to a booking in San Francisco\, his car collided head-on with another. Kemp broke a leg and several ribs and suffered a punctured lung. He developed pneumonia while in the hospital and died two days later. Edgar Clyde "Skinnay" Ennis\, Jr. (August 13\, 1907 - June 3\, 1963) was an American jazz and pop music bandleader and singer. Ennis was born in Salisbury\, North Carolina and met Hal Kemp while attending the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill. He joined Kemp's orchestra as a drummer and vocalist in the late 1920s\, playing with him through 1937 including one tour of Europe in 1930. Following this Ennis put together his own band\, which became a popular ensemble in Hollywood films. "Got a Date With an Angel" was his theme song. During this time Gil Evans was one of his arrangers. He also did comedy routines\, and landed a job on Bob Hope's radio program from 1938 through 1946. He conducted his own service band during World War II and returned to Hollywood bandleading at the war's end. Toward the end of the 1950s Ennis's career had faded\, and he worked mostly in hotels in the Los Angeles area. He choked to death on a bone while eating dinner at a restaurant in Beverly Hills in 1963. COL channel name VAL warholsoup100	0

He made a trip to Nashville circa 1955 where he played clubs and attempted to build interest\, but was turned down by the Grand Ole Opry\, as he had been at the Louisiana Hayride country stage and radio show in Shreveport. Recording executives in Nashville suggested he switch to playing a guitar.  Sun Records  In November 1956\, Lewis traveled to Memphis\, Tennessee\, to audition for Sun Records. Label owner Sam Phillips was in Florida\, but producer and engineer Jack Clement recorded Lewis's rendition of Ray Price's "Crazy Arms" and his own composition "End of The Road". During December 1956\, Lewis began recording prolifically\, as a solo artist and as a session musician for such Sun artists as Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash. His distinctive piano can be heard on many tracks recorded at Sun during late 1956 and early 1957\, including Carl Perkins's "Matchbox"\, "Your True Love"\, "You Can Do No Wrong"\, and "Put Your Cat Clothes On"\, and Billy Lee Riley's "Flyin' Saucers Rock'n'Roll".

Luego de su actuación en dicho film\, surgen diferencias de criterios tan usuales en las orquestas de música popular y\, el Maestro Armando Oréfiche le deja a sus compañeros todo\, inclusive el famoso nombre de la orquesta\, quedando ésta bajo la dirección de Gerardo Bruguera. Armando Oréfiche junto con otros músicos\, al separarse de la Lecuona Cuban Boys\, crea su propia agrupación: Armando Oréfiche y sus Havana Cuban Boys. A pesar de todo\, la Lecuona Cuban Boys continúa su carrera musical. Reside varios años en New York\, realiza de nuevo giras por América del Sur y hace su última presentación en Europa en 1961\, el el Kursaal de Ostende (Bélgica). La Orquesta mantiene su actividad hasta 1975.

Poseedor de una voz de barítono\, fue durante los años cuarenta una figura carismática de la música popular negra\, al liderar una de las primeras big band de bop y convertirse en el primer cantante negro de baladas románticas (fue llamado el Sinatra negro). Con el paso de los años\, su influencia ha sido considerable en el ámbito del soul y el rhythm and blues.  Eckstine comenzó a cantar a los nueve años y participó en numerosos espectáculos para aficionados. Aunque su vocación había sido la de jugador de fútbol americano\, una grave lesión lo recondujo hacia el mundo de la música. Tras diversos trabajos al oeste de Chicago a finales de los años treinta\, Eckstine fue invitado por Earl Hines para unirse a su Grand Terrace Orchestra en 1939.  Aunque sus primeros éxitos fueron canciones triviales como "Jelly\, Jelly" y "The Jitney Man"\, grabó también varios estándares como "Stormy Monday". Hacia 1943\, se acompañaba de estrellas como Dizzy Gillespie\, Charlie Parker y Sarah Vaughan. Tras formar su propia banda ese año\, contrató a los tres y gradualmente se hizo con más figuras modernas y con futuras estrellas: Wardell Gray\, Dexter Gordon\, Miles Davis\, Kenny Dorham\, Fats Navarro y Art Blakey\, así como con arreglistas como Tadd Dameron y Gil Fuller. La Billy Eckstine Orchestra fue la primera big band bop\, y su líder reflejaba las innovaciones bop adaptando sus armonías vocales a las baladas normales. A pesar del matiz moderno del grupo\, Eckstine encabezó las listas frecuentemente a mediados de los cuarenta\, con temas como "A Cottage for Sale" y "Prisoner of Love". En las giras por Europa y América\, el cantante tocaba también la trompeta\, el trombón de válvulas y la guitarra.  Forzado a disolver la orquesta en 1947 tras haber formado la suya propia Gillespie\, Eckstine realizó una transición hacia un estilo más baladístico y con arreglos de cuerda. Grabó más de una docena de éxitos a finales de los cuarenta\, entre lo que se incluyen "My Foolish Heart" y "I Apologize". Se hizo popular en Gran Bretaña\, obteniendo un gran éxito durante los cincuenta con temas como "No One But You" y "Gigi"\, así como con sus dúos con Sarah Vaughan. Eckstine regresaría a sus raíces jazzísticas ocasionalmente\, grabando con Vaughan\, Count Basie y Quincy Jones\, y grabando un LP en directo\, No Cover\, No Minimum\, en el que interpretaba algunos solos de trompeta. Grabó varios discos para Mercury y Roulette a comienzos de los sesenta y publicó en Motown algunos discos de estándares a mediados de esa década. Tras grabar muy espaciadamente en los setenta\, Eckstine hizo su última grabación (Billy Eckstine Sings with Benny Carter) en 1986. Murió por un ataque al corazón en 1993.

It was produced and directed by Frank Tashlin\, with a screenplay adapted by Tashlin and Herbert Baker from an uncredited novel Do Re Me by Garson Kanin. The movie was originally intended as a vehicle for the American sex symbol Jayne Mansfield\, with a satirical subplot involving teenagers and rock 'n' roll music. The unintended result has been called the "most potent" celebration of rock music ever captured on film.[3] The original music score\, including a title song performed by Little Richard\, was by Bobby Troup\, with an additional credit to Ray Anthony for the tune "Big Band Boogie". It was shot in DeLuxe Color\, filmed in CinemaScope\, and runs 99 minutes. COL channel name VAL AtoZofRockandRoll	0

COL title VAL Just One of Those Things COL performer VAL Doris Day	COL video title VAL AC/DC Tribute - Leslie King - You Shook Me All Night Long COL description VAL From the cd Backed in Black. Acoustic versions with female voices.  ---  Female acoustic versions of AC/DC songs? Yes\, it's a gimmick\, but it works on its own terms. And it's a sweet irony\, considering AC/DC's music has always been macho\, swaggering boys' anthems. So what happens when you put an army of Lilith Fair-ready female artists to these tunes? Something pretty good\, actually. In fact\, the best track on here is the opener\, Sunny Hodge's unbelievably sweet\, feminine "Hells Bells". The original\, with its spare\, ominous electric guitar riff and slow grinding groove\, is the last song I'd expected to work in this context\, but Hodge turns the riff into an almost primitive-blues acoustic riff while her thin\, sweet voice turns the cock-rock lyrics into something so bizarre\, you just have to grin. Single-name artist Patty does a good job turning "Highway to Hell" into a country-rock busking tune (I've sung that song with this arrangement\, myself)\, and Leslie King is also great on "You Shook Me All Night Long". "Back in Black"\, though\, suffers from cover artist Reyo Bikkin's inability to hit those Brian Johnson high notes on the chorus\, rendering those feral "Back in black!" hooks rather flaccid.  Strange and weirdly interesting. My big gripe is that\, excluding the two "bonus tracks" ending the disc ("Highway to Hell" and "For Those about to Rock")\, they did every song off the Back in Black album\, thus rendering the song selection very limited. Imagined if they'd had someone do "Rising Power"\, "Thunderstruck" or "Let There Be Rock" with an acoustic guitar and female vocals!   Review written by D.

The first concert\, filmed at the Grugahalle in Essen on 19 October 1980\, features a stellar band of Clem Clempson (guitars)\, Billy Cobham (drums) and David Sancious (keyboards)\, a line-up that had come together for the album "I've Always Wanted To Do This" earlier in the year. The set features many songs from that album alongside Cream classics and other Jack Bruce solo tracks. The second concert is a completely solo performance with Jack Bruce at the piano which really emphasizes the quality of his voice and the brilliance of his songwriting. The two shows make a great combination and this a must have DVD for any Jack Bruce fan.

(Fantine) J'avais rêvé d'une autre vie Mais la vie a tué mes rêves Comme on étouffe les derniers cris D'un animal que l'on achève  J'avais rêvé d'un coeur si grand Que le mien puisse y trouver place Mais mon premier prince charmant Fut l'assassin de mon enfance  J'ai payé de toutes mes larmes La rançon d'un petit bonheur À une société qui désarme La victime\, et pas le voleur  J'avais rêvé d'un seul amour Durant jusqu'à la fin du monde Dont on ne fait jamais le tour Aussi vrai que la terre est ronde  J'avais rêvé d'une autre vie Mais la vie a tué mes rêves À peine commencée\, elle finit Comme un court printemps qui s'achève  J'avais rêvé d'une autre vie Mais la vie a tué mes rêves À peine commencée\, elle finit Comme un court printemps qui s'achève  La nuit\, la nuit\, je sombre en mon corps Et je m'abandonne à des sinistres corps à corps La nuit\, la nuit\, pour deux pièces d'or Quand ils font jaillir en moi leur pitoyable effort Ils ne savent pas qu'ils font l'amour avec la mort !

Buy the CD\, well worth it.  STEAL AWAY was nominated for a 1996 Grammy Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Performance\, Individual Or Group. "Go Down\, Moses" was nominated for a Grammy for Best Jazz Instrumental Solo.  From the outset of his career with Ornette Coleman\, through his work with pianist Keith Jarrett\, his own Liberation Music Orchestra and collaborations with the likes of Paul Motian\, Hampton Hawes\, Chet Baker\, Carlos Paredes and Ginger Baker\, bassist Charlie Haden has always accorded the spiritual component of music greater importance than its technical considerations.  Haden's finest work has always focused on the most intimate\, humanistic principles: freedom\, justice\, quality. In pianist Hank Jones\, Haden encounters a collaborator and fellow traveller whose musical instincts are every inch as elegant and refined as his own. And in the rich public domain of materials which make up STEAL AWAY\, Haden and Jones take on an oral (and moral) tradition of music that has been inspiring listeners since before the time of the underground railroad.  Recorded at Radio Canada\, Montreal\, Canada on June 29 & 30\, 1994. Includes liner notes by Maurice Jackson\, Charlie Haden and Abbey Lincoln.  Personnel: Hank Jones (piano).  Audio Mixer: Jay Newland.  Liner Note Author: Maurice Jackson.  Recording information: Radio Canada\, Montreal\, Canada (06/29/1994/06/30/1994).  Photographer: Walker Evans.

Also\, a DVD called 'Bryn Terfel Live @ The Amsterdam Concertgebouw (2003)' you may find this part.  Enjoy!  (1945) Richard Rodgers\, Oscar Hammerstein II   The things I used to like I don't like anymore.  I want a lot of other things  I've never had before. It's just like mother says... I sit around and mope. Pretending I am wonderful. And knowing I'm a dope.  I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm\, I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string. I'd say that I had spring fever\, But I know it isn't spring.  I'm starry-eyed and vaguely discontented Like a nightingale without a song to sing. Oh\, why should I have spring fever When it isn't even spring?  I keep wishing I were somewhere else\,  Walking down a strange new street. Hearing words that I have never heard From a girl\, I've yet to meet.  I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams\, I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing. I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud Or a robin on the wing.  But I feel so gay\, In a melancholy way\, That it might as well be spring\,  It might as well be spring. COL channel name VAL J.

These images are gritty and real. Sometimes history repeats itself\, but hopefully the worst is behind us. Although "Hard Times Come Again No More" sounds as if it were written during the Great Depression\, it was actually written in 1854 by Stephen C. Foster\, America's pioneer songwriter. Mavis Staples\, one of the greatest living gospel and R&B singers\, recorded the song as part of  the CD "Beautiful Dreamer - The Songs of Stephen Foster"  a tribute album released on the Emergent Music label in 2004. Included are many of his famous and some lesser known songs recorded with contemporary interpretations and arrangements.

Goodnight and joy be with you all.  Oh\, if I had money enough to spend and leisure time to sit awhile There's a fair young man in this town that sorely has my heart beguiled His rosy cheeks and lovely lips\, alone he has my heart in thrall So fill to me the parting glass. Goodnight and joy be with you all.  Of all the comrades that here I've had\, they're sorry for my going away\, And of all the sweethearts that here I had\, they wish me one more day to stay\, But since it falls unto my lot that I should rise and you should not\, I will gently rise and softly call. Goodnight and joy be with you all. COL channel name VAL 92mystique	0

COL title VAL Youkali COL performer VAL Dee Dee Bridgewater	COL video title VAL Mitch Miller - Carolina In The Morning (VintageMusic.es) COL description VAL Mitch Miller (nacido Mitchell William Miller el 4 de julio de 1911 en el seno de una familia judía en Rochester\, New York)\, es recordado como uno de los artistas de mayor éxito de los años cincuenta y comienzos de los sesenta. Fue también ejecutivo de la Columbia Records durante muchos años y lideró durante muchos años su propio coro masculino\, "Mitch Miller and the Gang"\, antes de abandonarlo él mismo.  Miller y su coro fueron famosos por su transgresor espectáculo televisivo de los sesenta titulado Sing Along With Mitch. Durante la segunda temporada del programa\, el mismo Mitch Miller acuñó el eslogan "All Smiles"\, que iba precedido por las instrucciones para "sing along; just follow the bouncing ball" (un gran punto que saltaba sobre las palabras que eran sobreimpresionadas en televisión a la canción que Mitch estaba cantando). Los mayores éxitos de Miller con el coro fueron "The Yellow Rose of Texas"\, una versión baterística de la vieja marcha\, y "Colonel Bogey March"\, que más tarde disfrutaría de una renovada popularidad tras su uso en la película The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957). Además de su espectáculo televisivo\, Miller y su coro grabaron varios discos que se vendieron muy bien.    "Mule Train\,"el primer gran éxito de Miller (para Frankie Laine) y la fundación de su carrera\, establecieron el modelo para virtualmente toda la primera década del rock. Las similitudes entre ese tema y\, por ejemplo\, "Leader of the Pack"\, casi no es necesario subrayarlas aquí.  Miller firmó y produjo a muchos importantes artistas especializados en estándares del pop\, como Frankie Laine\, Johnnie Ray\, Ray Conniff\, Percy Faith\, Johnny Mathis\, Tony Bennett\, Guy Mitchell (cuyo pseudónimo en realidad estaba basado en el nombre de Miller)\, y ayudó directamente a las carreras de artistas que ya habían firmado con el sello\, como Doris Day\, Dinah Shore y Jo Stafford por nombrar a unos pocos. Miller se convirtió en uno de los más exitosos productores de música pop de la historia.  Miller es frecuentemente descrito por historiadores del rock como un enemigo del primer rock and roll. Miller hizo echar marcha atrás al contrato que John Hammond le había hecho a Bob Dylan para capitalizar la emergente moda de la música folk. Aunque finalmente perdería su trabajo en Columbia por negarse a producir el tipo de música que estaban comprando los adolescentes\, en principio Miller había intentado contratar a Elvis Presley\, aunque reculó ante las cifras que le pedía el manager de Elvis\, Colonel Tom Parker. Graduado en la Eastman School of Music\, Miller es también un consumado intérprete de oboe y corno inglés. Consiguió algún dinero en los comienzos de su carrera en los años treinta y cuarenta como intéprete de oboe; de hecho\, en esos años\, fue llamado en su calidad de oboísta\, por George Gershwin\, para integrar un conjunto de 55 músicos\, que saldrían de gira\, interpretando sus principales obras de esa época.  También integró\, en 1935\, la orquesta del estreno de "Porgy & Bess". Entre sus más admiradas interpretaciones de estudio dentro del terreno no clásico\, están sus aportes para The Voice of Frank Sinatra y para Bird With Strings de Charlie Parker. Miller recibió el Premio Grammy por toda una vida en 2000.

Other musicians include Donnie Winters (guitar)\, Gene Watson (bass) & Bobby Miller (drums). The Winters Brothers Band featuring Donnie Winters & yodeling king Don Winters on May 25\, 1986. Donnie\, his brother Dennis\, and the band received radio airplay in the 1970's as part of the southern rock scene. This was one of the few shows Donnie did without Dennis\, during this time period. Donnie's father the late Don Winters played with the band on this show. Don Winters performed with the late Marty Robbins for over a decade.  The Winters Brothers continue to have a TV show on the cable access channel.  I was instrumental in starting the Creekers Ball with announcer Danny Jones. In the 1980's\, it was yearly event in the River Road part of town\, showcasing bands in that area. Donnie and the band were nice enough to be our special guest at this annual charity event. I shot the video at all of the Creekers Ball events\, including this rare footage of the Winters Brothers Band. The sound quality is great\, as I came right out of the sound board\, and into a professional hi-fi recorder. Plus\, Donnie and the band sounded great.  Donnie currently runs a writers night on Tuesday Nights at Douglas Corner and sometimes plays at our own Play It Again Jam. I remember Donnie going all the way back to grade school in Nashville.

COL title VAL You Go to My Head COL performer VAL Helen Forrest	COL video title VAL Shirley Bassey - Everything I Have Is Yours (1962 Recording) COL description VAL 1962 (Here is a beautiful song from Shirley Bassey's 1962 LP titled\, 'Let's Face The Music with Nelson Riddle and his Orchestra.    ABOUT this song: "Everything I Have Is Yours" is a popular song.  The music was written by Burton Lane\, the lyrics by Harold Adamson. The song was published in 1933. It was first sung by Art Jarrett in the 1933 film Dancing Lady.  ABOUT the LP\, Let's Face The Music: Let's Face the Music is the sixth Shirley Bassey studio album\, released in 1962\, and arranged by Nelson Riddle.  Kenneth Hume\, Shirley Bassey's husband and manager wrote the sleeve notes for this album\, in which he gives an insight into how this album came to being: "When Vic Lewis booked Nelson Riddle for a tour with Shirley\, we were all very excited; being great fans of Nelson Riddle's from way back...so when someone suggested them doing an LP together\, we thought that this would not be possible\, remembering that Nelson was under contract with another recording company."  Nelson Riddle was under contract to Capitol Records at the time\, so Bassey's producer Norman Newell went about to secure his services for an album. While on the tour\, Bassey\, Riddle\, and Bassey's music director Raymond Long discussed what form the album should take. Shortly after the tour was completed\, the recording sessions began.  This album was issued in the US as Shirley Bassey Sings The Hit Song From "Oliver!" on the United Artists label\, with a slightly different track listing and alternative recordings. "I Can't Get You Out of My Mind" was replaced by "As Long As He Needs Me"\, and "Imagination"\, "All of Me" and "All the Things You Are" appear on Oliver! in alternative versions. The alternative versions have not yet been released in the UK and are still not available on CD.  The UK album was re-issued in 1971 as What Now My Love on the EMI Music For Pleasure (MFP) label\, it reached number 17 in the UK album charts.  LYRICS: Everything I have is yours  You're part of me  Everything I have is yours  My destiny   I would gladly give the sun to you  If the sun were only mine  I would gladly give the earth to you  And the stars that shine   Everything that I posses  I offer you   Make my dream of happiness come true  I'd be happy just to spent my life  Waiting at your beck and call   Everything I have is yours  My life\, my all   I'd be happy just to spent my life  Waiting at your beck and call   Everything I have is yours  My life\, my all  Special Thanks to Pieter\,  Astrid and others from the Shirley Bassey blog\, Tal from the Diamond Bassey website\, and all those who have contributed wonderful pictures of Shirley!

Arranged by James E. Bond\, Jr. Produced by Nick Venet.  Joanie\, who scored a #7 US hit with “Johnny Get Angry” in the summer of 1962\, didn’t return to Hot-100 after “When The Boys Get Together” charted in October of the same year.  Some great records followed on Warners\, however\, including the northern soul favorite\, “Don’t Pity Me” in 1965. By 1967\, Joanie was with Columbia\, where she released a number of Bacharach-David on 45; “Alfie”\, “It Doesn’t Matter Anymore” and “Take A Broken Heart”.   The following year\, Joanie had moved to Capitol but still retained an affinity for Bacharach-David songs by releasing “Trains And Boats And Planes”.  Other great versions of this Bacharach-David classic: Billy J Kramer & The Dakotas (1965\, US #47) and Dionne Warwick (1966\, US #22). COL channel name VAL 45rpmMike	1

What makes this rendition special is the trumpet solo which I referred to in my introduction\, by Frank Guarente\, (from 2.07).  Guarente led the Georgians and toured Europe around this time. He was to be featured with the Savoy Orpheans later. Leslie Jeffries delivers this delightful tune with aplomb\, from October 1924\, when the 20's were beginning to roar.

Levy B3 B.B. Written-By -- H.B. Barnum B4 White Daisies Written-By -- David McCallum B5 Oh My! Written-By -- David Axlerod  ------------------------  "Mellow Yellow" is a song and single release by Donovan. It reached #2 on the Billboard charts in the U.S. in 1966 and #8 in the UK in early 1967.  The song was rumored to be about smoking dried banana skins\, which was believed to be a hallucinogenic drug in the 1960s\, though this aspect of bananas has since been debunked. According to Donovan's notes accompanying the album Donovan's Greatest Hits\, the rumor that one could get high from smoking dried banana skins was started by Country Joe McDonald in 1966\, and Donovan heard the rumor three weeks before "Mellow Yellow" was released as a single. (According to The Rolling Stone Illustrated Encyclopedia of Rock and Roll\, he admitted later the song made reference to a vibrator; an "electrical banana" as mentioned in the lyrics.) The phrase "mellow yellow" appears on page 719 of the first American edition of James Joyce's Ulysses\, where it is used to refer to Mrs. Marion Bloom's buttocks\, but it is not known if Donovan got the phrase from there.  The record had a "Beatlesque" feel to it\, and was sometimes mistaken for a Beatles song. Donovan\, in fact\, was friends with the Beatles. Paul McCartney can be heard as one of the background revelers on this track\, but contrary to popular belief\, it is not McCartney whispering the "quite rightly" answering lines in the chorus\, but rather Donovan himself. Donovan had a small part in coming up with the lyrics for "Yellow Submarine"\, and McCartney played bass guitar (uncredited) on portions of Donovan's Mellow Yellow album.  Covers  R&B and jazz singer Georgie Fame recorded his own version with a distinctively different arrangement reminiscent of the Count Basie orchestra.  Charly B. also covered the song in 1983\, in Italo disco style.  In 1999\, "Mellow Yellow" was sung by a group of young adults\, among whom were then-unknowns Alex Greenwald\, Rashida Jones and Jason Thompson\, in Gap's "Everybody in Cords" commercial directed by Pedro Romhanyi. The music mix was done by the Dust Brothers.  In 2011\, the song was featured in a new commercial for Mello Yello drink\, as part of Coca-Cola's "Original Smooth" campaign to rebrand and reintroduce the drink. Also\, the song itself was covered by Family of the Year featuring Donovan. The version is available for download on the Mello Yello website.  Other adaptations  Cadbury used a modified version of the song to promote their Caramello Koala chocolates ("They call me Caramello ... Koala").  The song was also used in a series of television commercials to promote the use of butter.  In France\, Lipton used a modified version of the song to promote their tea ("They call me Lipton Yellow").  One of the oldest coffeeshops in Amsterdam is called "Mellow Yellow".  In episode 17 of the 5th season of Scrubs\, JD figures out the song is about jaundice (not quite rightly).  Jimi Hendrix made a reference to this song in his song "Bold As Love".  Frank Zappa referenced the song in his number "Absolutely Free" on the album We're Only In It For The Money (1967). COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

She came to our hotel for lunch\, on her bike\, dressed in a pair of cut-off cotton trousers and a T-shirt\, with her blond hair pulled back in a pony tail."  If I give my heart to you Will you handle it with care Will you promise you'll be true to me And in every way be fair  If I give my heart to you Will you give me all your love Will you always treat me tenderly Swear by stars that shine above  And will you sigh with me when I'm sad And smile with me when I'm glad And always be as you are with me tonight  Think it over and be sure Please don't answer till you do When you promise all these things to me Then I'll give my heart to you  Think it over and be sure Please don't answer till you do When you promise all these things to me Then I'll give my heart to you  If you promise all these things to me Then I'll give my heart to you  Words and music by Jimmy Brewster\, Jimmie Crane and Al Jacobs.

COL title VAL This Nearly Was Mine COL performer VAL Frank Sinatra	COL video title VAL Betty Carter - Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye (Bet-Car Records 1982) COL description VAL "Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye" is a song with lyrics and music by Cole Porter. It was introduced in 1944 in Billy Rose's musical revue\, Seven Lively Arts. It is interesting to note that in the phrase "change from major to minor\," Mr. Porter begins with an Ab major chord and ends with an Ab minor one\, cleverly matching words and music. The song has since become a jazz standard after gaining popularity in the late 1950s and early 1960s.  Many artists have replaced the apostrophe in "ev'ry" with an "e" and have combined "time" to form the more common "everytime."  Betty Carter (born Lillie Mae Jones\, May 16\, 1929 -- September 26\, 1998) was an American jazz singer known for her improvisational technique\, scatting abilities\, and other complex musical abilities that demonstrated her vocal talent and imaginative interpretation of lyrics and melodies. Vocalist Carmen McRae once remarked\, "there's really only one jazz singer - only one: Betty Carter."  Carter continued to perform\, tour\, and record\, as well as search for new talent until she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in the summer of 1998. Betty Carter died on September 26\, 1998\, at the age of 69\, and was later cremated.  Carter often recruited young accompanists for performances and recordings\, insisting that she "learned a lot from these young players\, because they're raw and they come up with things that I would never think about doing." 1993 was Carter's biggest year of innovation\, creating a program called Jazz Ahead\, which took 20 students who were given the opportunity to spend an entire week training and composing with Carter\, a program that still exists to this day and is hosted in The Kennedy Center.  Betty Carter is considered responsible for discovering great jazz talent\, her list including such names as John Hicks\, Curtis Lundy\, Mulgrew Miller\, Cyrus Chestnut\, Dave Holland\, Stephen Scott\, Kenny Washington\, Benny Green and more.  Betty's accompanied by David Amram (Arranger & Conductor)\, Curtis Lundy (Bass)\, Lewis Nash (Drums)\, Khalid Moss (Piano)\, Jerry Dodgion (Saxophone [Alto]).  Everytime we say goodbye\, I die a little I wonder why a little  When you're near\, feels like spring  Everytime we say goodbye\, I die a little Everytime we say goodbye\, I wonder why a little Why the Gods above me\, who must be in the know How could they think so little of me\, that they allow you to go  When you're near\, there's such an air of spring about it I can hear a lark somewhere\, begin to sing about it There's no love song finer\, but how strange the change from major to minor Everytime we say goodbye Everytime we say goodbye\, I cry COL channel name VAL RoundMidnightTV	0

Buzzy Linhart's first of two albums for Kama Sutra\, three if you include the band Music's on the Buddah-distributed Eleuthera Records\, 1971's The Time to Live Is Now has the songwriter playing with different styles and sounds in a setting that is not as refined as the Eddie Kramer co-produced Music album or Barry Beckett and Roger Hawkins' production of 1974's Pussycats Can Go Far. But don't blame the artist for that. In an exclusive interview for the All Media Guide conducted February 28th\, 2002\, Linhart revealed some of the secrets of The Time To Live Is Now: Bill Takas and Luther Rix\, the bass player and drummer\, are "world class jazz and classical musicians." Bill Takas spent nine years on the Tonight Show\, and they co-founded Ten Wheel Drive (with Genya Ravan; see the Construction #1 LP). "We had been performing eight-to-ten months as a trio\, sometimes with sax...it was supposed to be more [produced] like 'Pussycats' (Pussycats Can Go Far)...but [record exec] Neil Bogart played this for a group of 30-something pros for Buddah/Kama Sutra\, and they got up out of their chairs and danced to it." That resulted in the late Neil Bogart deciding he wanted to release the roughs -- the rough vocals\, the rough mix\, even with a 32\,000 dollar budget\, which was pretty good at that point in time. They called this "rock-folk\," rock with a jazz tinge as opposed to "jazz rock" that was Blood\, Sweat & Tears. Even in its raw form\, it is great stuff. Linhart lifts lines from here and there. Four lines from the Beatles' 1968 hit "Lady Madonna" are taken almost verbatim in the title track -- "Who buys the money\, when you pay the rent" -- while the strange "Cheat Cheat Lied" is fused with Percy Mayfield's "Hit the Road Jack\," Linhart lifting a melody and line from Blind Faith's "Presence of the Lord." On the following album\, Buzzy (also called "The Black Album" as his 1969 outing on Phillips was also titled Buzzy)\, he's more blatantly lifting "What the World Needs Now Is Love" for his "Rollin' On" title. When he goes into Chester Powers' 1963 composition "Let's Get Together\," you think he's absconding with lyrics and melody again\, but it's actually a very cool cover of the Youngbloods' "Get Together\," which hit for them in 1967 and 1969. It is charming\, as is the first appearance of "Friends\," the Barry Manilow-produced hit for Bette Midler in 1973\, re-cut by Buzzy on Pussycats Can Go Far and the only appearance here of friend Moogy Klingman\, in the capacity of co-writer. Most of the material is by Linhart\, "Good Face" being co-written with future Music bandmemberDoug Rodrigues\, while drummer and co-producer Luther Rix pens and sings "Comin' Home." The group covers Jordan Kaplan's "There's No Need" with the legendary Ken Ascher on piano\, and Jeannie Linhart does a vocal harmony on "The Love's Still Growing\," but other than that\, it's the three-piece unit producing and performing on this Kama Sutra debut album. Todd Rundgren would come onboard to mix "The Black Album\," 1972's Buzzy\, which would replace Takas with Danny Trifan on bass\, and add Jeff "Skunk" Baxter on guitar\, but The Time to Live Is Now remains an important\, albeit raw\, document of a major talent emerging from the early '70s.  -Allmusic COL channel name VAL plusgloss	0

Jimmy Lytell was a member from 1922 to 1925 and Miff Mole as standout musicians in the group.  Jimmy Durante played piano (with Ladd's Black Aces) while both Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey were members of the Original Memphis Five. The group made many recordings between 1921 and 1931\, sometimes under different names\, including Ladd's Black Aces (from 1921 until 1924) and The Cotton Pickers. The name Original Memphis Five was first used in 1920\, and applied to various small groups of white musicians throughout the decade. Both Red Nichols and Miff Mole later led their own groups named Original Memphis Five. Phil Napoleon\, however\, would continue using the group name until 1990.   In the first two decades of the 20th century\, the social dance was passing through enormous transformations both in its form and spiritual content. From the waltz or a tango - which were the intimate au pair experience - it was developing towards a hot collective\, almost tribal dance imported from Africa and the Caribbean. "Coarse"\, "boorish"\, "vulgar" - those are only some from vast collection of insults the new dances were determined by the journals. Machicha\, shimmy - these were the first swallows of the dancefloor entertainment. Yet\, it wasn't until 1925 - when came King Charleston and took power - and the world learned what it might be a collective dance madness.   Shimmy - which in 1919 was launched exaequo by two Broadway stars: Gilda Gray and Bee Palmer - was an earlier version of the Charleston\, more elaborate with the elements of oriental dance. The name "shimmy" comes from one of the figures of Arabic belly dancing. Gilda Gray however - who was Polish (Marianna Michalska born in Cracow\, Poland) - supported the rumors - supposedly for self-promotional purposes - that name "shimmy" comes from her imperfect English\, when preparing to go on stage Gilda spoke to her dresser: - Gimmie dat' sheemiee' (chemise). For these and other reasons\, the slideshow in this film presents a small collection of lovely covers of the shimmy-sheet music from various places in the world.  For those who want to see\, how DID REALLY look the shimmy-dance\, go and see two fantastic shimmy-renditions by the Budapest Operetta artrists\, from 2012 and 2010 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBp8yqpSOgA  and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExjcIaAAMug and also a very good Russian version from 2010 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp1Hzm803q0 .

COL title VAL Rave On COL performer VAL Waylon Jennings	COL video title VAL Xavier Cugat and His Orchestra -  Night Train COL description VAL " I only sing in the shower. I would join a choir\, but I don't think my bathtub can hold that many people.  "  ― Jarod Kintz  "Night Train" has a long and complicated history. The piece's opening riff was first recorded in 1940 by a small group led by Duke Ellington sideman Johnny Hodges under the title "That's the Blues\, Old Man". Ellington used the same riff as the opening and closing theme of a longer-form composition\, "Happy-Go-Lucky Local"\, that was itself one of four parts of his Deep South Suite. Forrest was part of Ellington's band when it performed this composition\, which has a long tenor saxophone break in the middle. After leaving Ellington\, Forrest recorded "Night Train" on United Records and had a major rhythm & blues hit. While "Night Train" employs the same riff as the earlier recordings\, it is used in a much earthier R&B setting. Forrest inserted his own solo over a stop-time rhythm not used in the Ellington composition. He put his own stamp on the tune\, but its relation to the earlier composition is obvious. Like Illinois Jacquet's solo on "Flying Home"\, Forrest's original saxophone solo on "Night Train" became a veritable part of the composition\, and is usually recreated in cover versions by other performers. Buddy Morrow's trombone transcription of Forrest's solo from his big-band recording of the tune is similarly incorporated into many performances. Broadcast Music\, Inc. (BMI) credits the composition to Jimmy Forrest and Oscar Washington. Xavier "Cugie" Cugat adds some ingredients of his own musical style and brings us a "latin" sounding arrangement here that really swings !  Cugat's rhythm section plays an important part in this rendition which makes the song even more danceable. From the 1964 Album "Caricatures" here's Xavier Cugat and His Orchestra with that golden blues & jazz standard : "Night Train".   Enjoy the ride ;) ! COL channel name VAL Socratess2007	0

COL title VAL Crazy Horses COL performer VAL Puny Human	COL video title VAL Mina - I'll be Seeing you (2012) COL description VAL 2 note: "I'll be Seeing you" è una canzone popolare\, con musica di Sammy Fain e testo di Irving Kahal. Pubblicata nel 1938\, la canzone fu inserita nel musical di Broadway "This Way" \,in cui venne  eseguita dal cantante Tamara Drasin\, che aveva qualche anno prima cantato "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes". Il brano è uno standard jazz\, ed è statoinciso da numerosi artisti nel corso degli anni. Il tema musicale ha potere emotivo\, ed è stato molto amato durante la seconda guerra mondiale\, quando divenne un inno per coloro che prestavano servizio all'estero (dai soldati britannici e  americani). La versione più ricordata è quella di Billie Holiday (1944) e altrettanto nota è quella di Bing Crosby dello stesso anno\, dal film omonimo con  Ginger Rogers and Joseph Cotten. Mina la propone nel suo album "12 American Songbook" del 2012.

COL title VAL You and the Night and the Music COL performer VAL Donna Byrne	COL video title VAL Johnny Cash - Wanted Man - Live at San Quentin (Good Sound Quality) COL description VAL Another great song from the San Quentin Prison concert of February 1969\, this one co-written with Bob Dylan.  Whilst I have a rather different world view from the late great Johnny Cash\, I'm nevertheless a big fan. He's the reason I first picked up a guitar in 2003. I always wanted to see live concert footage\, but with good clear sound\, so decided to synchronise the sound from my CD with TV footage available on Youtube. Easier said than done though... The TV footage is faster and about a whole tone higher in pitch\, so I had to slow the video down to match it with the audio.   I know I'm blatantly flaunting copyright guidlines\, but I reckon a few people might like this so much that they go out and buy the CD... like I did when I first heard the Man in Black on the radio!

COL title VAL Black Is Black COL performer VAL Tony Hatch	COL video title VAL Xavier Cugat and His Orchestra -  Night Train COL description VAL " I only sing in the shower. I would join a choir\, but I don't think my bathtub can hold that many people.  "  ― Jarod Kintz  "Night Train" has a long and complicated history. The piece's opening riff was first recorded in 1940 by a small group led by Duke Ellington sideman Johnny Hodges under the title "That's the Blues\, Old Man". Ellington used the same riff as the opening and closing theme of a longer-form composition\, "Happy-Go-Lucky Local"\, that was itself one of four parts of his Deep South Suite. Forrest was part of Ellington's band when it performed this composition\, which has a long tenor saxophone break in the middle. After leaving Ellington\, Forrest recorded "Night Train" on United Records and had a major rhythm & blues hit. While "Night Train" employs the same riff as the earlier recordings\, it is used in a much earthier R&B setting. Forrest inserted his own solo over a stop-time rhythm not used in the Ellington composition. He put his own stamp on the tune\, but its relation to the earlier composition is obvious. Like Illinois Jacquet's solo on "Flying Home"\, Forrest's original saxophone solo on "Night Train" became a veritable part of the composition\, and is usually recreated in cover versions by other performers. Buddy Morrow's trombone transcription of Forrest's solo from his big-band recording of the tune is similarly incorporated into many performances. Broadcast Music\, Inc. (BMI) credits the composition to Jimmy Forrest and Oscar Washington. Xavier "Cugie" Cugat adds some ingredients of his own musical style and brings us a "latin" sounding arrangement here that really swings !  Cugat's rhythm section plays an important part in this rendition which makes the song even more danceable. From the 1964 Album "Caricatures" here's Xavier Cugat and His Orchestra with that golden blues & jazz standard : "Night Train".   Enjoy the ride ;) ! COL channel name VAL Socratess2007	0
COL title VAL Sunshine of Your Love COL performer VAL The Jimi Hendrix Experience	COL video title VAL Jack Bruce - Sunshine Of Your Love (from "Golden Days") COL description VAL Jack Bruce - Sunshine Of Your Love (from "Golden Days")  This DVD contains two complete and very different concerts by Jack Bruce filmed for the German TV series Rockpalast. The first concert\, filmed at the Grugahalle in Essen on 19 October 1980\, features a stellar band of Clem Clempson (guitars)\, Billy Cobham (drums) and David Sancious (keyboards)\, a line-up that had come together for the album "I've Always Wanted To Do This" earlier in the year. The set features many songs from that album alongside Cream classics and other Jack Bruce solo tracks. The second concert is a completely solo performance with Jack Bruce at the piano which really emphasizes the quality of his voice and the brilliance of his songwriting. The two shows make a great combination and this a must have DVD for any Jack Bruce fan.

Ar Log\, one of the best Welsh Folk Groups recorded this very beautiful lovesong. Y Deryn Pur (The Gentle Dove)  Y deryn pur â'r adain las Bydd i mi'n was dibrydar O! brysur brysia at y ferch Lle rhois i'm serch yn gynnar Dos di ati\, dywed wrthi Mod i'n wylo'r dwr yn heli Mod i'n irad am ei gwelad Ac o'i chariad yn ffaelu â cherddad\, O! Duw faddeuo'r hardd ei llun Am boeni dyn mor galad!  Pan o'wn yn hoenus iawn fy hwyl Ddiwrnod gwyl yn gwylio Canfyddwn fenyw lana' rioed Ar ysgafn droed yn rhodio. Pan y'i gwelais syth mi sefais Yn fy nghalon mi feddyliais Wele ddynes lana'r deyrnas A'i gwên yn harddu'r oll o'i chwmpas Ni fynnwn gredu un dyn byw Nad oedd hi ryw angyles!   English  O gentle dove with wings so blue Fly quickly to my lady And take to her a message true While in her garden shady Go to her and say I love her And am trying to discover How to meet her\, fondly greet her But if my love should fail to please her May God forgive her beautiful face I know that I must leave her.  With heart so gay one happy day I walked with step so sprightly The loveliest girl I'd ever seen Came tripping there so lightly On her beauty so amazing I could only stand there gazing Of the fairest\, she the rarest Her smile make all around her shining She was an angel to my eyes And for her love I'm pining.

COL title VAL Estrellita COL performer VAL Mr. Acker Bilk with The Leon Young String Chorale	COL video title VAL DAVID RUFFIN -"(IF LOVING YOU IS WRONG) I DON'T WANT TO BE RIGHT" (1973) COL description VAL David Ruffin's third and self-titled solo offering was in many ways a collaborative effort with Bobby Miller\, who produced the David Ruffin (1973) album and supplied eight of its ten tracks. There is a conspicuous dichotomy between the personas that Ruffin portrays throughout the project and the man whose fractious relationship with Motown had practically cost him his association with the label. Things had gotten so bad\, they permanently shelved what should have been Ruffin's third LP. Motown simply refused to put it out until cooler heads eventually prevailed some three decades later. He was likewise no longer afforded access to "A-list" material and support musicians either. While his previous outings had sold respectably\, they certainly were no match for the likes of Stevie Wonder\, Marvin Gaye\, or even his former bandmates in the Temptations whose "Papa Was a Rollin' Stone" had been a crossover pop chart topper months earlier. "The Rovin' Kind" gets things underway bearing an almost emblematic mid-tempo Motown groove. Ruffin's once crystalline voice now endures the sonic substantiation of chronic drug and alcohol addiction. In a perverse way\, the combination of his aging falsetto\, coupled with the rough-hewn timbre\, actually enhance his role in the ballad "Common Man\," as well as the blithe and bouncy "I'm Just a Mortal Man" with the Andantes providing the equally amicable background vocals. The update of "(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want to Be Right" -- a seductive side that Luther Ingram had considerable success with the previous year -- is personalized as Ruffin confides in the opening that he is "a man in desperation" backing it up with the plea "can't you help the situation"? His short rhythmically spoken intro continues as he owns up to his reputation as a "wild child\," begging the question whether Ruffin is actually in or out of character. The Philly-style soul of the Kenny Gamble/Leon Huff written "I Miss You" suits the heart-wrenching adaptation. The six-plus minute gritty social commentary "Blood Donors Needed (Give All You Can)" is a starkly accurate portrayal of inner-city life. Perhaps in the escapism mentality of the times\, it failed to make an impact on the singles charts. Yet\, the lack of a marketable 45 seems to have had little relevance on R&B record buyers as David Ruffin made it into the Top Five album survey -- although it did not fare nearly as well\, peaking at number 168 on the pop side. Those slipping figures are endemic indicators of the increasing lack of interest that Motown would invest in Ruffin's future endeavors. COL channel name VAL MANNY MORA	0

COL title VAL Stardust COL performer VAL The Pasadena Roof Orchestra	COL video title VAL Ray Stevens - Alley Oop (1969) COL description VAL "Alley Oop" is from the album called Gitarzan and was Rays' fourth studio album\, released in 1969\, as well as his second for Monument Records. Unlike his previous album\, "Even Stevens"\, this album is completely in the genres of novelty and comedy.   Although this is a true studio album\, all of the songs are overdubbed with cheering and applauding of an audience to provide the feeling of a live album. Cover versions include three of the Coasters' hits ("Yakety Yak\," "Little Egypt" and "Along Came Jones")\, "Mr. Custer\," and "Alley Oop." The album also contains re-recordings of his two novelty hits\, "Harry the Hairy Ape" and "Ahab the Arab." "Freddie Feelgood (And His Funky Little Five Piece Band)" makes its first appearance on an album but is overdubbed with audience noises for this album.  Aside from "Freddie Feelgood\," two singles were lifted from this album: the title track (which tells a bizarre story about Tarzan and Jane and Cheetah forming a music band) and "Along Came Jones". The album version of the former begins with cheers and applause from an audience while the single version does not.  Ray would re-record Alley Oop in 2012 for his box-set called "Encyclopedia of Recorded Comedy Music". COL channel name VAL raystevensbigfan	0

COL title VAL Ruler of My Heart COL performer VAL The Crawdaddys	COL video title VAL Billy Eckstine -- Stranger in Paradise COL description VAL Billy Eckstine (Pittsburgh\, 8 de julio de 1914 - Pittsburgh\, 8 de marzo de 1993) fue un cantante estadounidense de jazz y música pop. Poseedor de una voz de barítono\, fue durante los años cuarenta una figura carismática de la música popular negra\, al liderar una de las primeras big band de bop y convertirse en el primer cantante negro de baladas románticas (fue llamado el Sinatra negro). Con el paso de los años\, su influencia ha sido considerable en el ámbito del soul y el rhythm and blues.  Eckstine comenzó a cantar a los nueve años y participó en numerosos espectáculos para aficionados. Aunque su vocación había sido la de jugador de fútbol americano\, una grave lesión lo recondujo hacia el mundo de la música. Tras diversos trabajos al oeste de Chicago a finales de los años treinta\, Eckstine fue invitado por Earl Hines para unirse a su Grand Terrace Orchestra en 1939.  Aunque sus primeros éxitos fueron canciones triviales como "Jelly\, Jelly" y "The Jitney Man"\, grabó también varios estándares como "Stormy Monday". Hacia 1943\, se acompañaba de estrellas como Dizzy Gillespie\, Charlie Parker y Sarah Vaughan. Tras formar su propia banda ese año\, contrató a los tres y gradualmente se hizo con más figuras modernas y con futuras estrellas: Wardell Gray\, Dexter Gordon\, Miles Davis\, Kenny Dorham\, Fats Navarro y Art Blakey\, así como con arreglistas como Tadd Dameron y Gil Fuller. La Billy Eckstine Orchestra fue la primera big band bop\, y su líder reflejaba las innovaciones bop adaptando sus armonías vocales a las baladas normales. A pesar del matiz moderno del grupo\, Eckstine encabezó las listas frecuentemente a mediados de los cuarenta\, con temas como "A Cottage for Sale" y "Prisoner of Love". En las giras por Europa y América\, el cantante tocaba también la trompeta\, el trombón de válvulas y la guitarra.  Forzado a disolver la orquesta en 1947 tras haber formado la suya propia Gillespie\, Eckstine realizó una transición hacia un estilo más baladístico y con arreglos de cuerda. Grabó más de una docena de éxitos a finales de los cuarenta\, entre lo que se incluyen "My Foolish Heart" y "I Apologize". Se hizo popular en Gran Bretaña\, obteniendo un gran éxito durante los cincuenta con temas como "No One But You" y "Gigi"\, así como con sus dúos con Sarah Vaughan. Eckstine regresaría a sus raíces jazzísticas ocasionalmente\, grabando con Vaughan\, Count Basie y Quincy Jones\, y grabando un LP en directo\, No Cover\, No Minimum\, en el que interpretaba algunos solos de trompeta. Grabó varios discos para Mercury y Roulette a comienzos de los sesenta y publicó en Motown algunos discos de estándares a mediados de esa década. Tras grabar muy espaciadamente en los setenta\, Eckstine hizo su última grabación (Billy Eckstine Sings with Benny Carter) en 1986. Murió por un ataque al corazón en 1993.

Records. The album consists of twelve cover songs and no originals. Autumn Records\, the band's previous label\, had sold the band to Warner Brothers in early 1966. Warner Brothers\, however\, did not control the publishing rights\, and opted to have the band record an album of covers\, including songs originally performed by Richard Berry\, Rolling Stones\, The Beatles and Bob Dylan\, as well as recent hit singles by such acts as The Mamas & the Papas and Simon & Garfunkel. Lead vocalist Sal Valentino explained\, "When we went to Warner Brothers\, they were just anxious to get a record out\, to capitalize on the success we had. That record was the wrong one to do at the time.  The album features Don Irving on guitar. Irving briefly became a member of the Beau Brummels filling in for Ron Elliott\, who also played on the album\, but was unable to withstand the rigors of touring due to his diabetic condition.

COL title VAL Dark as a Dungeon COL performer VAL Dolly Parton	COL video title VAL The David Rose Orchestra -   Happy Heart COL description VAL "Knowing a person is like music. What attracts us is their melody and as we get to know who they are\, we learn their lyrics." ( Unknown) ▼▼▼  DAVID ROSE Recipient of four Emmy awards\, Rose was born in London\, to Jewish parents\, and raised in Chicago\, Illinois. Rose's career in music began when he worked with Ted Fio Rito's band when he was sixteen. Rose also worked as a standby pianist for NBC Radio. It was here\, in the early 1930s\, that he first gained a reputation\, while arranging for the Frank Trumbauer orchestra and later leading a house band at station WGN. He composed several early swing originals such as "Break It Down" with Frankie Trumbauer\, "Transcontinental\," "Plantation Moods\," and a piece recorded under three different titles: "I've Got It"\, "Itchola"\, and "Jigsaw Rhythm\," his original version with the WGN band including Louis Prima. Rose was asked to come to Hollywood\, where he formed his orchestra\, doing a twice-weekly radio show for Mutual Broadcasting System called California Melodies\, where he wrote all the broadcast arrangements. He worked his way up to becoming music director of the Mutual network.  Rose's first try at composing was his hit song "Holiday for Strings". During World War II\, Rose entered the Army and it was here where he met Red Skelton. Skelton asked Rose to become the conductor for his Raleigh Cigarettes Program. Rose joined the cast in 1948 and went on to work with Skelton on his television show for over 20 years. "Holiday for Strings" became well known as the theme for Red Skelton's programs. A parody version\, retitled "Holiday for States"\, was recorded as a vocal by Allan Sherman\, with the straight melody but with ersatz lyrics consisting solely of the names of the American states. Rose also was the composer of some famous TV themes such as "Bonanza" and "Little House on the Prairie".  He recorded more than 30 easy listening albums during his career which span nearly 50 years.  HAPPY HEART "Happy Heart" is a song written by James Last and Jackie Rae. The song was recorded by both Petula Clark and Andy Williams and released as a single for each at the same time in 1969. "Happy Heart" reached #12 on the Easy Listening chart and #62 in the UK for Clark\, while Williams went to #22 on the 'Billboard Hot 100\, #19 in the UK\, and spent two weeks at #1 on the Easy Listening charts.  MHO A superb arrangement of James Last's "classic theme" with a most original intro and dito ending.  The skill of David Rose as an arranger is highlighted here as he adds "minor" musical details to the score\, thus lifting the song to an even higher level.  I especially like the "conversations" between the base and the brass - the small pauses\, together with the majestic refrain parts definitely turn my heart into a "happy one" ;-) ! Enjoy !

COL title VAL You Don't Have to Go COL performer VAL Barrelhouse	COL video title VAL BUZZY LINHART - Let's Get Together (1971) COL description VAL From the 1971 album THE TIME TO LIVE IS NOW. Buzzy Linhart's first of two albums for Kama Sutra\, three if you include the band Music's on the Buddah-distributed Eleuthera Records\, 1971's The Time to Live Is Now has the songwriter playing with different styles and sounds in a setting that is not as refined as the Eddie Kramer co-produced Music album or Barry Beckett and Roger Hawkins' production of 1974's Pussycats Can Go Far. But don't blame the artist for that. In an exclusive interview for the All Media Guide conducted February 28th\, 2002\, Linhart revealed some of the secrets of The Time To Live Is Now: Bill Takas and Luther Rix\, the bass player and drummer\, are "world class jazz and classical musicians." Bill Takas spent nine years on the Tonight Show\, and they co-founded Ten Wheel Drive (with Genya Ravan; see the Construction #1 LP). "We had been performing eight-to-ten months as a trio\, sometimes with sax...it was supposed to be more [produced] like 'Pussycats' (Pussycats Can Go Far)...but [record exec] Neil Bogart played this for a group of 30-something pros for Buddah/Kama Sutra\, and they got up out of their chairs and danced to it." That resulted in the late Neil Bogart deciding he wanted to release the roughs -- the rough vocals\, the rough mix\, even with a 32\,000 dollar budget\, which was pretty good at that point in time. They called this "rock-folk\," rock with a jazz tinge as opposed to "jazz rock" that was Blood\, Sweat & Tears. Even in its raw form\, it is great stuff. Linhart lifts lines from here and there. Four lines from the Beatles' 1968 hit "Lady Madonna" are taken almost verbatim in the title track -- "Who buys the money\, when you pay the rent" -- while the strange "Cheat Cheat Lied" is fused with Percy Mayfield's "Hit the Road Jack\," Linhart lifting a melody and line from Blind Faith's "Presence of the Lord." On the following album\, Buzzy (also called "The Black Album" as his 1969 outing on Phillips was also titled Buzzy)\, he's more blatantly lifting "What the World Needs Now Is Love" for his "Rollin' On" title. When he goes into Chester Powers' 1963 composition "Let's Get Together\," you think he's absconding with lyrics and melody again\, but it's actually a very cool cover of the Youngbloods' "Get Together\," which hit for them in 1967 and 1969. It is charming\, as is the first appearance of "Friends\," the Barry Manilow-produced hit for Bette Midler in 1973\, re-cut by Buzzy on Pussycats Can Go Far and the only appearance here of friend Moogy Klingman\, in the capacity of co-writer. Most of the material is by Linhart\, "Good Face" being co-written with future Music bandmemberDoug Rodrigues\, while drummer and co-producer Luther Rix pens and sings "Comin' Home." The group covers Jordan Kaplan's "There's No Need" with the legendary Ken Ascher on piano\, and Jeannie Linhart does a vocal harmony on "The Love's Still Growing\," but other than that\, it's the three-piece unit producing and performing on this Kama Sutra debut album. Todd Rundgren would come onboard to mix "The Black Album\," 1972's Buzzy\, which would replace Takas with Danny Trifan on bass\, and add Jeff "Skunk" Baxter on guitar\, but The Time to Live Is Now remains an important\, albeit raw\, document of a major talent emerging from the early '70s.  -Allmusic COL channel name VAL plusgloss	0
COL title VAL Lover Man COL performer VAL Jordyn Jackson	COL video title VAL Halie Loren - What A Wonderful World COL description VAL Dedicated to children in every war-torn and oppressed part of Planet Earth.  I sincerely hope and pray that one day you will get to see the 'wonderful' side of this world.  ** Halie Loren - I love you and the way you revitalize the classics.  Thank you and wish you all the best in your career.  My gratitude to all the uploaders of the visuals used in this video.  ** Don't we all love the hope and optimism in this classic.  Obviously\, when it was written and recorded back in 1967\, the world was nothing like today\, even though it was at the height of Vietnam War.  Wouldn't you agree with me that in about 5 decades since\, this song should be reworked and re-titled as 'What A Horrible World.'  Fortunate are you who live in a very peaceful land away from the sight and sound of atrocity\, or if you have an option to not watch/read any news.  The original version by Louis Armstrong would still make sense and stay true.  I made this video two months ago and was waiting to upload.  In fact\, I didn't even want to upload it now\, or maybe ever\, because the words and content sound insincere\, faking\, and misleading.  Every one of my videos was inspired by someone or something.  This one was initially inspired by several hateful events that occurred to me.  It was made to comfort myself and to put some hope and optimism back in my heart.    Just as I was recovering\, the image of the lifeless body of a Syrian refugee boy (his name was Aylan Kurdi) on a Turkish beach reaffirmed how this song sounds more like an utter lie than just a simple empty and false promise of hope.  Please take it however you like.  If this video helps restore your optimism\, I am happy.  If it makes you feel worse\, you have my apologies.  As for me\, it hasn't made me feel better.  The news that the SAT scores are now at the lowest level in 10 years\, the fact that boss has just complained to me last night that kids nowadays can't even spell simple words while no one in the position of authority watches out for the future of these children make me sadder.  Worse\, looking around myself\, I see people keep escalating their pursuit of destruction of other people groups; some stir up more and more hatred based on religious beliefs.  I have to ask myself if I dare to believe that this world is a wonderful one.  As of now\, you don't want to know my answer.  ** No copyright infringement intended on video clips\, still photos\, and music. Made for entertainment purposes without financial gain.

Natel / Claude-Michel Schönberg.  (Fantine) J'avais rêvé d'une autre vie Mais la vie a tué mes rêves Comme on étouffe les derniers cris D'un animal que l'on achève  J'avais rêvé d'un coeur si grand Que le mien puisse y trouver place Mais mon premier prince charmant Fut l'assassin de mon enfance  J'ai payé de toutes mes larmes La rançon d'un petit bonheur À une société qui désarme La victime\, et pas le voleur  J'avais rêvé d'un seul amour Durant jusqu'à la fin du monde Dont on ne fait jamais le tour Aussi vrai que la terre est ronde  J'avais rêvé d'une autre vie Mais la vie a tué mes rêves À peine commencée\, elle finit Comme un court printemps qui s'achève  J'avais rêvé d'une autre vie Mais la vie a tué mes rêves À peine commencée\, elle finit Comme un court printemps qui s'achève  La nuit\, la nuit\, je sombre en mon corps Et je m'abandonne à des sinistres corps à corps La nuit\, la nuit\, pour deux pièces d'or Quand ils font jaillir en moi leur pitoyable effort Ils ne savent pas qu'ils font l'amour avec la mort !

I sincerely hope and pray that one day you will get to see the 'wonderful' side of this world.  ** Halie Loren - I love you and the way you revitalize the classics.  Thank you and wish you all the best in your career.  My gratitude to all the uploaders of the visuals used in this video.  ** Don't we all love the hope and optimism in this classic.  Obviously\, when it was written and recorded back in 1967\, the world was nothing like today\, even though it was at the height of Vietnam War.  Wouldn't you agree with me that in about 5 decades since\, this song should be reworked and re-titled as 'What A Horrible World.'  Fortunate are you who live in a very peaceful land away from the sight and sound of atrocity\, or if you have an option to not watch/read any news.  The original version by Louis Armstrong would still make sense and stay true.  I made this video two months ago and was waiting to upload.  In fact\, I didn't even want to upload it now\, or maybe ever\, because the words and content sound insincere\, faking\, and misleading.  Every one of my videos was inspired by someone or something.  This one was initially inspired by several hateful events that occurred to me.  It was made to comfort myself and to put some hope and optimism back in my heart.    Just as I was recovering\, the image of the lifeless body of a Syrian refugee boy (his name was Aylan Kurdi) on a Turkish beach reaffirmed how this song sounds more like an utter lie than just a simple empty and false promise of hope.  Please take it however you like.  If this video helps restore your optimism\, I am happy.  If it makes you feel worse\, you have my apologies.  As for me\, it hasn't made me feel better.  The news that the SAT scores are now at the lowest level in 10 years\, the fact that boss has just complained to me last night that kids nowadays can't even spell simple words while no one in the position of authority watches out for the future of these children make me sadder.  Worse\, looking around myself\, I see people keep escalating their pursuit of destruction of other people groups; some stir up more and more hatred based on religious beliefs.  I have to ask myself if I dare to believe that this world is a wonderful one.  As of now\, you don't want to know my answer.  ** No copyright infringement intended on video clips\, still photos\, and music. Made for entertainment purposes without financial gain.

Chloe by Plas Johnson\, a very popular saxophone player\,  from the 1959 Capitol stereo LP titled Mood For The Blues.   Plas John Johnson Jr. (born July 21\, 1931) is an American soul-jazz and hard bop tenor saxophonist\, probably most widely known as the tenor saxophone soloist on Henry Mancini's "The Pink Panther Theme".     Recruited by Capitol Records in the mid-1950s\, Johnson also played on innumerable records by Peggy Lee\, Nat "King" Cole\, Glen Gray\, Frank Sinatra and others. He remained a leading session player for almost twenty years\, averaging two sessions a day and playing everything from movie soundtracks to rock and roll singles\, by such artists as Ricky Nelson and Bobby Vee. He played on many of the Beach Boys' records\, and was an integral part of a number of instrumental groups that existed in name only\, such as B. Bumble and the Stingers. In the late 1950s and early 1960s he was a regular member of Henry Mancini's studio orchestra and in 1963 he recorded the Pink Panther theme. Another solo for a well-known television series was on The Odd Couple's theme music. Johnson was also used by Motown\, and played on hits by Marvin Gaye\, the Supremes and others.  Johnson can be heard on the 1963 album "Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Jerome Kern Songbook"\, recorded under the baton of the great Nelson Riddle. His sax is also heard on two of the other great Ella Fitzgerald songbooks - The Harold Arlen Songbook and The Johnny Mercer Songbook.  In 1964\, Johnson was the featured performer on "Blue Martini" ( Ava Records )\, a concept album by John Neel. It was a groundbreaking album\, with the saxophone being the lead "voice" surrounded by a full string section. This jazz/classical hybrid contains some of Johnson's best and most innovative playing\, with the standout being "Bury Me Blue".  In 1970\, he joined the studio band for "The Merv Griffin Show" and also played with a number of jazz and swing bands of the period. He continues to record and perform\, particularly at jazz festivals.  Johnson currently performs on T990 (brass) and T9937 (solid silver) tenor saxophones made by Yanagisawa. He uses a very open (140/2) Berg Larsen stainless steel mouthpiece with Rico Plasticover no. 2 reeds\, a setup that enables him to produce his very di COL channel name VAL maynardcat	0

The things we did last summer I'll remember all winter long  ( brief instrumental)  I've tried so to forget\, at times I do\, and yet The memory of you lingers like our song The things we did last summer\, I'll remember all winter long...       212 COL channel name VAL 65Seasons	0

COL title VAL Angel COL performer VAL Javier Colon	COL video title VAL The Beau Brummels\, Play With Fire (Rolling Stones cover) COL description VAL Beau Brummels '66 is the third studio album by American rock group The Beau Brummels\, and their first on Warner Bros. Records. The album consists of twelve cover songs and no originals. Autumn Records\, the band's previous label\, had sold the band to Warner Brothers in early 1966. Warner Brothers\, however\, did not control the publishing rights\, and opted to have the band record an album of covers\, including songs originally performed by Richard Berry\, Rolling Stones\, The Beatles and Bob Dylan\, as well as recent hit singles by such acts as The Mamas & the Papas and Simon & Garfunkel. Lead vocalist Sal Valentino explained\, "When we went to Warner Brothers\, they were just anxious to get a record out\, to capitalize on the success we had. That record was the wrong one to do at the time.  The album features Don Irving on guitar. Irving briefly became a member of the Beau Brummels filling in for Ron Elliott\, who also played on the album\, but was unable to withstand the rigors of touring due to his diabetic condition.

This was her 10th LP in just 15 years as a professional singer. If I Give My Heart To You was a US Top 5 hit in 1954 for Doris Day. DANA's (superior) version made #27 in Ireland. She wrote in her autobiography about the time she first saw Doris Day in America in 1970: "But the greatest highlight for me was when I saw Doris Day in person. She came to our hotel for lunch\, on her bike\, dressed in a pair of cut-off cotton trousers and a T-shirt\, with her blond hair pulled back in a pony tail."  If I give my heart to you Will you handle it with care Will you promise you'll be true to me And in every way be fair  If I give my heart to you Will you give me all your love Will you always treat me tenderly Swear by stars that shine above  And will you sigh with me when I'm sad And smile with me when I'm glad And always be as you are with me tonight  Think it over and be sure Please don't answer till you do When you promise all these things to me Then I'll give my heart to you  Think it over and be sure Please don't answer till you do When you promise all these things to me Then I'll give my heart to you  If you promise all these things to me Then I'll give my heart to you  Words and music by Jimmy Brewster\, Jimmie Crane and Al Jacobs.

COL title VAL The Parting Glass COL performer VAL Loreena McKennitt	COL video title VAL Arnett Cobb  -  Blues In The Closet COL description VAL Track from Arnett Cobb - Party Time Label: Prestige Released ; 1959 Tenor saxophonist Arnett Cobb\, who was inactive between 1957 and 1958 due to a serious auto accident\, recorded three strong albums for Prestige during the first half of 1959. Party Time is the only one of the trio that features Cobb as the only horn and backed by a pianist (Ray Bryant) instead of an organ player with bassist Wendell Marshall\, drummer Art Taylor and Ray Barretto on conga completing the group\, most of the focus is on Cobb's tough yet flexible tenor. Such songs as "When My Dreamboat Comes Home\," "Blues in the Closet" and a remake of "Flying Home" make this the definitive Arnett Cobb album from the era. Highly recommended. ~ Scott Yanow  Arnett Cobb has that honking\, bar-walking saxophone sound that used to blast from jukeboxes coast-to-coast. There was always excitement elicited by Cobb’s uninhibited\, blasting style which earned him the label “Wild Man of the Tenor Sax.” ( Leo T.

In 2012\, for the James Bond video game 007 Legends\, an instrumental version was written and composed by David Arnold for the main title sequence\, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the film franchise.  Live and televised performances  In 1980\, Shirley Bassey performed the song on The Muppet Show. In 1997\, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers covered the song in concert\, and it is featured on their career-spanning live set\, The Live Anthology. In 2011\, Céline Dion included the song as part of a "James Bond Medley" in her Las Vegas show Celine. In 2013\, Shirley Bassey sang the song at the Academy Awards in tribute to the 50 years of James Bonds films. Bassey received a standing ovation after her performance.  Soundtrack appearances  In 1998\, the song was to feature prominently in the film Little Voice\, appearing in much the manner of its first use – but with Michael Caine slamming the door that becomes the song's first chord blast\, rather than\, of course\, Sean Connery. In 1999\, in the "Shutout In Seattle" episode of US sitcom Frasier\, the song is featured in the final scene\, with Frasier Crane\, Niles Crane and Martin Crane singing along to a piano accompaniment. The song is sung at Jordan Belfort's wedding in the 2013 film The Wolf of Wall Street.  Remixes and examples  In 2000\, the song was remixed by Propellerheads for the album Diamonds are Forever: The Shirley Bassey Remix Album. In 2007\, it was sampled by reggaeton artist Tego Calderón on his song "Alegría"\, off of his album El Abayarde Contraataca.  Parodies  Parodies of the song include "Dr. Evil"\, written by They Might Be Giants for Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me\, and "Max Power"\, from the The Simpsons episode "Homer to the Max".  Inspired songs  In 1989\, after the release of the James Bond theme song "Licence to Kill"\, from the film of the same title\, it was felt to significantly reuse important elements of "Goldfinger"\, and so the songwriting credits for the former were adapted for all subsequent releases.

COL title VAL Money (That's What I Want) COL performer VAL Renee Geyer	COL video title VAL AC/DC Tribute - Leslie King - You Shook Me All Night Long COL description VAL From the cd Backed in Black. Acoustic versions with female voices.  ---  Female acoustic versions of AC/DC songs? Yes\, it's a gimmick\, but it works on its own terms. And it's a sweet irony\, considering AC/DC's music has always been macho\, swaggering boys' anthems. So what happens when you put an army of Lilith Fair-ready female artists to these tunes? Something pretty good\, actually. In fact\, the best track on here is the opener\, Sunny Hodge's unbelievably sweet\, feminine "Hells Bells". The original\, with its spare\, ominous electric guitar riff and slow grinding groove\, is the last song I'd expected to work in this context\, but Hodge turns the riff into an almost primitive-blues acoustic riff while her thin\, sweet voice turns the cock-rock lyrics into something so bizarre\, you just have to grin. Single-name artist Patty does a good job turning "Highway to Hell" into a country-rock busking tune (I've sung that song with this arrangement\, myself)\, and Leslie King is also great on "You Shook Me All Night Long". "Back in Black"\, though\, suffers from cover artist Reyo Bikkin's inability to hit those Brian Johnson high notes on the chorus\, rendering those feral "Back in black!" hooks rather flaccid.  Strange and weirdly interesting. My big gripe is that\, excluding the two "bonus tracks" ending the disc ("Highway to Hell" and "For Those about to Rock")\, they did every song off the Back in Black album\, thus rendering the song selection very limited. Imagined if they'd had someone do "Rising Power"\, "Thunderstruck" or "Let There Be Rock" with an acoustic guitar and female vocals!   Review written by D. Mok\, is available on amazon.com  ---  Check out the other tracks.  1. Hells Bells - Sunny Hodge    2. Shoot To Thrill - Marmalade    3. What Do You Do For Money Honey - Nikki Boyer    4.

Goodnight and joy be with you all.  Oh\, if I had money enough to spend and leisure time to sit awhile There's a fair young man in this town that sorely has my heart beguiled His rosy cheeks and lovely lips\, alone he has my heart in thrall So fill to me the parting glass. Goodnight and joy be with you all.  Of all the comrades that here I've had\, they're sorry for my going away\, And of all the sweethearts that here I had\, they wish me one more day to stay\, But since it falls unto my lot that I should rise and you should not\, I will gently rise and softly call. Goodnight and joy be with you all. COL channel name VAL 92mystique	0

It is London's trademark for the most advanced and flexible of all stereo recording techniques; it stands for motion and an uncanny sense of spatial realism unapproached by conventional disc standards; it is your assurance of unmatched quality control\, rigorously applied from studio to finished disc\, throughout every single step of the manufacturing process. Perhaps the most remarkable innovation of "phase 4" is the use of London's custom built 20 channel console mixer. This complex and forbidding-looking machine permits sounds from no less than twenty separate sources to be combined and blended in precise perspective. Each instrument can be pinpointed at exact locations from extreme left to extreme right along the horizontal plane\, or forward and back through an astonishingly large depth of field. This\, of course\, is only part of the "phase 4" story. The making of the master tape\, the cutting of the master lacquer disc\, production of the final copy for the consumer -all are done with custom equipment\, under the constant supervision of both engineers and musicians. The statement that the 500\,000th record produced is identical in sound performance with the very first copy pressed is no idle boast: it is part of the  unique and proud credo of "phase 4 stereo". »   Phase4Stereo :  Please use as a series only\, adding it together with the Decca or London Records labels. The mono parallel series and technique was Sound 4. Phase 4 Stereo was a series created in 1961\, supposedly for better sound\, by being recorded on a 10-channel\, and later 20-channel\, recording console. Approximately 200 LPs were released under this branch\, including popular music\, "gimmick" records engineered to make the sound travel from speaker to speaker\, records featuring percussion effects\, and historical sound-effect records. In 1964\, a light-classical Phase 4 Stereo Concert  Series was produced. COL channel name VAL Art Buggy's Cheesecakes	0

COL title VAL True Colors COL performer VAL Joanie Bartels	COL video title VAL BUZZY LINHART - Let's Get Together (1971) COL description VAL From the 1971 album THE TIME TO LIVE IS NOW. Buzzy Linhart's first of two albums for Kama Sutra\, three if you include the band Music's on the Buddah-distributed Eleuthera Records\, 1971's The Time to Live Is Now has the songwriter playing with different styles and sounds in a setting that is not as refined as the Eddie Kramer co-produced Music album or Barry Beckett and Roger Hawkins' production of 1974's Pussycats Can Go Far. But don't blame the artist for that. In an exclusive interview for the All Media Guide conducted February 28th\, 2002\, Linhart revealed some of the secrets of The Time To Live Is Now: Bill Takas and Luther Rix\, the bass player and drummer\, are "world class jazz and classical musicians." Bill Takas spent nine years on the Tonight Show\, and they co-founded Ten Wheel Drive (with Genya Ravan; see the Construction #1 LP). "We had been performing eight-to-ten months as a trio\, sometimes with sax...it was supposed to be more [produced] like 'Pussycats' (Pussycats Can Go Far)...but [record exec] Neil Bogart played this for a group of 30-something pros for Buddah/Kama Sutra\, and they got up out of their chairs and danced to it." That resulted in the late Neil Bogart deciding he wanted to release the roughs -- the rough vocals\, the rough mix\, even with a 32\,000 dollar budget\, which was pretty good at that point in time. They called this "rock-folk\," rock with a jazz tinge as opposed to "jazz rock" that was Blood\, Sweat & Tears. Even in its raw form\, it is great stuff. Linhart lifts lines from here and there. Four lines from the Beatles' 1968 hit "Lady Madonna" are taken almost verbatim in the title track -- "Who buys the money\, when you pay the rent" -- while the strange "Cheat Cheat Lied" is fused with Percy Mayfield's "Hit the Road Jack\," Linhart lifting a melody and line from Blind Faith's "Presence of the Lord." On the following album\, Buzzy (also called "The Black Album" as his 1969 outing on Phillips was also titled Buzzy)\, he's more blatantly lifting "What the World Needs Now Is Love" for his "Rollin' On" title. When he goes into Chester Powers' 1963 composition "Let's Get Together\," you think he's absconding with lyrics and melody again\, but it's actually a very cool cover of the Youngbloods' "Get Together\," which hit for them in 1967 and 1969. It is charming\, as is the first appearance of "Friends\," the Barry Manilow-produced hit for Bette Midler in 1973\, re-cut by Buzzy on Pussycats Can Go Far and the only appearance here of friend Moogy Klingman\, in the capacity of co-writer. Most of the material is by Linhart\, "Good Face" being co-written with future Music bandmemberDoug Rodrigues\, while drummer and co-producer Luther Rix pens and sings "Comin' Home." The group covers Jordan Kaplan's "There's No Need" with the legendary Ken Ascher on piano\, and Jeannie Linhart does a vocal harmony on "The Love's Still Growing\," but other than that\, it's the three-piece unit producing and performing on this Kama Sutra debut album. Todd Rundgren would come onboard to mix "The Black Album\," 1972's Buzzy\, which would replace Takas with Danny Trifan on bass\, and add Jeff "Skunk" Baxter on guitar\, but The Time to Live Is Now remains an important\, albeit raw\, document of a major talent emerging from the early '70s.  -Allmusic COL channel name VAL plusgloss	0

COL title VAL Black Betty COL performer VAL Spiderbait	COL video title VAL Dionne Warwick Do You Know the Way to San Jose 1968 International Smash COL description VAL Dionne Warwick's 1968 million selling Grammy winning international smash hit the Billboard Top 10 in May 1968\, Record World Top 40 at #8 and was also a UK smash at #8. The flip side "Let Me Be Lonely" also written by Bacharach and David also hit the Billboard Hot 100\, one of many double sided hits Dionne recorded on Florence Greenberg's Scepter label. Dionne charted an astonishing eight Billboard Top Twenty hits in less than 30 months: Alfie-#15 July 67; I Say A Little Prayer-Nov 67-#4; Theme From Valley of the Dolls-Feb 68-#2 (4 weeks); Do You Know the Way to San Jose-May 68-#10; Promises\, Promises-Oct 1968-#19; This Girl's In Love With You-March 1969-#7; You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling-#15-Sept 69; I'll Never Fall In Love Again-Jan 70-#6. In addition\, Warwick hit the Top 40 in the same time period with Windows of the World-Sept 67\, Who Is Gonna Love Me-July 68\, and The April Fools-July 69. In 1969 Dionne was the first African-American Female Vocalist to win in the Grammy category Best Contemporary-Pop Vocal Performance\, Female for Do You Know the Way to San Jose. "San Jose" was also used as the theme in Dodge automobile commercials in 1968 and 1969\, for the Charger and the Challenger. "Do You Know the Way to San Jose" became "Dodge Is Turning Up the Fever Now"! Another note of trivia: the background vocalists for this session were Valerie Simpson (Ashford & Simpson)\, Cissy Houston and DeeDee Warwick.  Writes Nick Tosches\, the renowned writer\, music journalist\, novelist\, biographer and poet in the January 7\, 1972 issue of the rock magazine FUSION; ".getting into Dionne Warwick is like finding buried treasure. The Bacharach/David repertoire which milady chooses to sing is so fascinatingly cynical / fatalistic / stoical / emotional / happy\, simultaneously! It's pure emotion. There is a whole lot more to emotion than some rock punk bursting his dexedrine-staved blood vessels by screaming "Baby I need you baby" into a microphone. Dionne Warwick is not a rock and roll singer. She's not a jazz singer either. Rhythm and blues? Nope. A pop singer? No way. Did you ever tongue-kiss with someone who barfed a Singapore Sling bolus into your mouth\, and then four years later you're with someone else and you feel good and you realize how beautiful it all was and then it's all melancholy/happiness\, sort of? That's the kind of singer Dionne Warwick is. She's beautiful. Dionne\, paired with Bacharach's string/horn/reed arrangements\, comes up as a lyric mezzo-sopranoid par-excellence\, melodious/expressiveness-wise. If you've never gotten into her\, you ought to. Get hep to Dionne Warwick. For your own sake." COL channel name VAL dibotis	0

Goodnight and joy be with you all.  Oh\, if I had money enough to spend and leisure time to sit awhile There's a fair young man in this town that sorely has my heart beguiled His rosy cheeks and lovely lips\, alone he has my heart in thrall So fill to me the parting glass. Goodnight and joy be with you all.  Of all the comrades that here I've had\, they're sorry for my going away\, And of all the sweethearts that here I had\, they wish me one more day to stay\, But since it falls unto my lot that I should rise and you should not\, I will gently rise and softly call. Goodnight and joy be with you all. COL channel name VAL 92mystique	0

I've only added the footage as a tribute for historical\, entertainment\, and creative purposes with no financial gain. Copyright infringement not intended.  Jessie Belvin "Goodnight My Love" 1956  This is a Mint- Copy of this great all-time classic\, please enjoy!  The all-time classic "Mr. Easy" Jessie Belvin   While not nearly as well remembered by the general public as either Sam Cooke or Otis Redding\, singer Jesse Belvin was in many regards a performer of equal stature whose career was also cut far too short by tragedy. At the time of his death\, Belvin was moving in the much the same direction as Cooke (he was even on the same record label\, although signed earlier)\, and was scoring and writing hits long before Redding ever cut a record. Jesse Lorenzo Belvin was born in San Antonio\, TX\, in 1932. When he was five\, his family relocated to Los Angeles\, and by age seven he was singing in church. He discovered R&B in his early teens\, and in 1950 joined jazz saxophonist Big Jay McNeely's backing vocal quartet Three Dots and a Dash. Belvin's falsetto was placed up front in his debut release\, 1950's "All the Wine Is Gone"; the response was so strong that on the group's next record\, his name was placed directly under McNeely's on the B-side\, "Sad Story." In 1952\, Belvin and bandmate Marvin Phillips signed to Specialty. They cut four singles: the first three — "Baby Don't Go\," "One Little Blessing\," and "Love of My Life" — were credited to Jesse Belvin\, and all failed to chart. The last\, "Dream Girl\," which featured Belvin on piano and vocals with Phillips on saxophone\, was credited to Jesse & Marvin\, and got to number two on the R&B charts in 1953.   It was with Modern that he cut his most enduring record. "Goodnight My Love" had been written by producer George Mottola ten years earlier\, but he had never been able to finish it; Belvin provided the lines for the bridge that completed the song\, but asked for 400 dollars in lieu of co-authorship credit. Mottola didn't have it\, but a colleague\, John Marascalco\, did\, and put up the money\, receiving co-authorship credit in the bargain.  The song reached number seven on the R&B charts in 1956; curiously\, the pianist on the recording was an 11-year-old session player making his recording debut named BARRY WHITE\, who would emerge as a giant in his own right about two decades later. More important at the time\, "Goodnight My Love" became the outro theme to Alan Freed's rock & roll radio show\, heard by millions of young listeners every night. Belvin cut ten singles for Modern\, of which "Goodnight My Love" was far and away the most successful. In 1958\, he was again on the move\, recording for Knight\, Class\, and Jamie Records under his own name\, as well as for the Aladdin label in association with the Sharptones.  His biggest success that year\, however\, came through a group called the Shields\, which had been formed by George Mottola to record on his own Tender label. Adding his voice to the mix\, Belvin joined the group\, which also included Frankie Ervin on lead\, Johnny "Guitar" Watson on bass\, baritone Tommy "Buster" Williams\, "Handsome" Mel Williams on second tenor\, Ernie Freeman on piano\, Irving Ashby on bass\, Rene Hall guitar\, and Davis Williams drums. The Shields' only record with Belvin was "You Cheated\," which had already been cut by a white group called the Slades; the Shields' version was the more successful\, reaching number 15 on the pop charts in the summer of 1958.  In late 1959\, with the encouragement of his wife and the support of producer Dick Pierce and arranger/conductor Marty Paich\, Belvin went into the studio for three recording dates that yielded a dozen songs\, among them intensely soulful covers of standards like "Blues in the Night\," "In the Still of the Night\," and "Makin' Whoopee." The band included Art Pepper on the sax and clarinet and Jack Sheldon on the trumpet\, and the playing was extraordinary all the way around.  Alas\, Belvin never heard the finished album\, Mr. Easy; on February 6\, 1960\, shortly after finishing a performance in Little Rock\, AR\, on a bill with Sam Cooke\, Jackie Wilson\, and Marv Johnson\, Belvin and his wife were killed in a head-on auto collision. Mr. Easy was released later in 1960\, his final testament and an enduring legacy.  This Is such a sad\, sad thing. God Bless you Jessie Belvin\, your life ended too soon\, but your soul & your music will still live on\, as long as we keep listening. R.I.P.

Some great records followed on Warners\, however\, including the northern soul favorite\, “Don’t Pity Me” in 1965. By 1967\, Joanie was with Columbia\, where she released a number of Bacharach-David on 45; “Alfie”\, “It Doesn’t Matter Anymore” and “Take A Broken Heart”.

COL title VAL Always Something There to Remind Me COL performer VAL Butch Walker	COL video title VAL Jack Bruce - Sunshine Of Your Love (from "Golden Days") COL description VAL Jack Bruce - Sunshine Of Your Love (from "Golden Days")  This DVD contains two complete and very different concerts by Jack Bruce filmed for the German TV series Rockpalast. The first concert\, filmed at the Grugahalle in Essen on 19 October 1980\, features a stellar band of Clem Clempson (guitars)\, Billy Cobham (drums) and David Sancious (keyboards)\, a line-up that had come together for the album "I've Always Wanted To Do This" earlier in the year. The set features many songs from that album alongside Cream classics and other Jack Bruce solo tracks. The second concert is a completely solo performance with Jack Bruce at the piano which really emphasizes the quality of his voice and the brilliance of his songwriting. The two shows make a great combination and this a must have DVD for any Jack Bruce fan.

COL title VAL Gimme Shelter COL performer VAL The Glasspack	COL video title VAL Helen Morgan - Body and Soul (1930) COL description VAL "Body and Soul" Words and Music by Edward Heyman\, Robert Sour\, Frank Eyton and John Green Performed by Helen Morgan with orchestra conducted by Leonard Joy Recorded September 12\, 1930\, New York  Helen Morgan (1900 - 1941) was born in Danville\, Illinois.  She worked for a while in mail order houses and in other mercantile establishments before trying her hand at show business. Her first experiences with the stage were without any particular distinction and to make something happen she entered a beauty contest and won it.  The contest was won in Canada and those in the Dominion to whom it mattered much were somewhat chagrined when her birthplace was revealed.  That didn't matter to Miss Morgan; all that mattered was that she'd had her first break.    By the early 1920s she had firmly established her reputation as a top-flight night-club singer\, both in America and abroad. In Europe\, at a Command Performance before the Duke of Windsor (then the Prince of Wales)\, a member of the Royal household approached her and warned her not to sing any vulgar songs.  She replied\, "If I did\, you'd have to teach them to me."  Returning to the States after that triumphant European jaunt\, Miss Morgan appeared in "Show Boat"\, the Ferber-Kern masterpiece which was to become her most successful and famous venture.   Until her untimely death at the age of forty-one\, Helen Morgan graced many Broadway shows\, radio programs and Hollywood films. COL channel name VAL bsgs98	0
COL title VAL Little Red Rooster COL performer VAL Dickie Peterson	COL video title VAL Gene Vincent - For your Precious Love (Town Hall Party - 1958) COL description VAL Gene Vincent only had one really big hit\, "Be-Bop-a-Lula\," which epitomized rockabilly at its prime in 1956 with its sharp guitar breaks\, spare snare drums\, fluttering echo\, and Vincent's breathless\, sexy vocals. Yet his place as one of the great early rock & roll singers is secure\, backed up by a wealth of fine smaller hits and non-hits that rate among the best rockabilly of all time. The leather-clad\, limping\, greasy-haired singer was also one of rock's original bad boys\, lionized by romanticists of past and present generations attracted to his primitive\, sometimes savage style and indomitable spirit. Vincent was bucking the odds by entering professional music in the first place. As a 20-year-old in the Navy\, he suffered a severe motorcycle accident that almost resulted in the amputation of his leg\, and left him with a permanent limp and considerable chronic pain for the rest of his life. After the accident he began to concentrate on building a musical career\, playing with country bands around the Norfolk\, VA\, area. Demos cut at a local radio station\, fronting a band assembled around Gene by his management\, landed Gene Vincent & the Blue Caps a contract at Capitol\, which hoped they'd found competition for Elvis Presley. Indeed it had\, as by this time Vincent had plunged into all-out rockabilly\, capable of both fast-paced exuberance and whispery\, almost sensitive ballads. The Blue Caps were one of the greatest rock bands of the '50s\, anchored at first by the stunning silvery\, faster-than-light guitar leads of Cliff Gallup. The slap-back echo of "Be-Bop-a-Lula\," combined with Gene's swooping vocals\, led many to mistake the singer for Elvis when the record first hit the airwaves in mid-1956\, on its way to the Top Ten. The Elvis comparison wasn't entirely fair; Vincent had a gentler\, less melodramatic style\, capable of both whipping up a storm or winding down to a hush. Brilliant follow-ups like "Race With the Devil\," "Bluejean Bop\," and "B-I-Bickey\, Bi\, Bo-Bo-Go" failed to click in nearly as big a way\, although these too are emblematic of rockabilly at its most exuberant and powerful. By the end of 1956\, the Blue Caps were beginning to undergo the first of constant personnel changes that would continue throughout the '50s\, the most crucial loss being the departure of Gallup. The 35 or so tracks he cut with the band -- many of which showed up only on albums or b-sides -- were unquestionably Vincent's greatest work\, as his subsequent recordings would never again capture their pristine clarity and uninhibited spontaneity. Vincent had his second and final Top Twenty hit in 1957 with "Lotta Lovin'\," which reflected his increasingly tamer approach to production and vocals\, the wildness and live atmosphere toned down in favor of poppier material\, more subdued guitars\, and conventional-sounding backup singers. He recorded often for Capitol throughout the rest of the '50s\, and it's unfair to dismiss those sides out of hand; they were respectable\, occasionally exciting rockabilly\, only a marked disappointment in comparison with his earliest work. His act was captured for posterity in one of the best scenes of one of the first Hollywood films to feature rock & roll stars\, The Girl Can't Help It. Live\, Vincent continued to rock the house with reckless intensity and showmanship\, and he became particularly popular overseas. A 1960 tour of Britain\, though\, brought tragedy when his friend Eddie Cochran\, who shared the bill on Vincent's U.K. shows\, died in a car accident that he was also involved in\, though Vincent survived. By the early '60s\, his recordings had become much more sporadic and lower in quality\, and his chief audience was in Europe\, particularly in England (where he lived for a while) and France. His Capitol contract expired in 1963\, and he spent the rest of his life recording for several other labels\, none of which got him close to that comeback hit. Vincent never stopped trying to resurrect his career\, appearing at a 1969 Toronto rock festival on the same bill as John Lennon\, though his medical\, drinking\, and marital problems were making his life a mess\, and diminishing his stage presence as well. He died at the age of 36 from a ruptured stomach ulcer\, one of rock's first mythic figures. ~ Richie Unterberger\, Rovi  PLEASE NOTE:  I divided my uploads among multiple channels\,  Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

If you go away As I know you will You must tell the world To stop turning 'til you return again If you ever do For what good is love Without loving you? Can I tell you now As you turn to go I'll be dying slowly 'til the next hello  If you go away If you go away If you go away...  **NO COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT INTENDED** COL channel name VAL Κωνσταντίνος Κεβρεκίδης	0

Jimmy Lytell was a member from 1922 to 1925 and Miff Mole as standout musicians in the group.  Jimmy Durante played piano (with Ladd's Black Aces) while both Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey were members of the Original Memphis Five. The group made many recordings between 1921 and 1931\, sometimes under different names\, including Ladd's Black Aces (from 1921 until 1924) and The Cotton Pickers. The name Original Memphis Five was first used in 1920\, and applied to various small groups of white musicians throughout the decade. Both Red Nichols and Miff Mole later led their own groups named Original Memphis Five. Phil Napoleon\, however\, would continue using the group name until 1990.   In the first two decades of the 20th century\, the social dance was passing through enormous transformations both in its form and spiritual content. From the waltz or a tango - which were the intimate au pair experience - it was developing towards a hot collective\, almost tribal dance imported from Africa and the Caribbean. "Coarse"\, "boorish"\, "vulgar" - those are only some from vast collection of insults the new dances were determined by the journals. Machicha\, shimmy - these were the first swallows of the dancefloor entertainment. Yet\, it wasn't until 1925 - when came King Charleston and took power - and the world learned what it might be a collective dance madness.   Shimmy - which in 1919 was launched exaequo by two Broadway stars: Gilda Gray and Bee Palmer - was an earlier version of the Charleston\, more elaborate with the elements of oriental dance. The name "shimmy" comes from one of the figures of Arabic belly dancing. Gilda Gray however - who was Polish (Marianna Michalska born in Cracow\, Poland) - supported the rumors - supposedly for self-promotional purposes - that name "shimmy" comes from her imperfect English\, when preparing to go on stage Gilda spoke to her dresser: - Gimmie dat' sheemiee' (chemise). For these and other reasons\, the slideshow in this film presents a small collection of lovely covers of the shimmy-sheet music from various places in the world.  For those who want to see\, how DID REALLY look the shimmy-dance\, go and see two fantastic shimmy-renditions by the Budapest Operetta artrists\, from 2012 and 2010 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBp8yqpSOgA  and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExjcIaAAMug and also a very good Russian version from 2010 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp1Hzm803q0 . All are danced to Emmerich Kalman's famous shimmy "Fräulein\, woll'n Sie Shimmy tanzen?" from operette "Bayadera". COL channel name VAL 240252	0

Su questo brano potranno scorrere fiumi d'inchiostro\,perchè la versione in inglese pare sia una sorta di plagio bello e buono di "Uno dei tanti" di Mogol e Carlo Donida uscito nel 1961 e portata al successo da Joe Sentieri\, quindi ben due anni prima di quella Ben.E. King che invece uscì nel 1963...  You know - everybody\, no matter who they are  And no matter how different they might be\,  Always runs across the same problem at least once  And that's the problem of love.  And maybe just once in your life\,  You're gonna fall in love with somebody so bad\,  And it's gonna be somebody that don't need you at all  Somebody that's got everything in the world there is to have  And you've got nothing.   I\, I who have nothing  I\, I who have no one  Adore you and love you so  I'm just a no one with nothing to give you but love  I love you   And then you guys\, you're gonna have to tell her something too  So you walk up to that girl and you sing\,   He\, he buys you diamonds  Bright\, sparkling diamonds  But believe me\, hear what I say  He can buy you the world but he'll never love the way  I love you   Listen here\, he can take you any place he wants  To fancy clubs and restaurants  While I can only watch you with  My nose pressed up against the window pane   If then\, just when you think that everything that you already love  Everything that you said has worth and find out that it didn't work at all  Yet when you're all alone you're gonna think about person that you loved so   Bad  Then you're gonna turn out the lights and you're gonna cry all to yourself   I\, I who have nothing  I\, I who have no one  Must watch you go dancing by  Wrapped in the arms of somebody else when darling\, it's I   Who loves you  Who loves you  Who loves you  Who loves you COL channel name VAL grease52	0

Fue también ejecutivo de la Columbia Records durante muchos años y lideró durante muchos años su propio coro masculino\, "Mitch Miller and the Gang"\, antes de abandonarlo él mismo.  Miller y su coro fueron famosos por su transgresor espectáculo televisivo de los sesenta titulado Sing Along With Mitch. Durante la segunda temporada del programa\, el mismo Mitch Miller acuñó el eslogan "All Smiles"\, que iba precedido por las instrucciones para "sing along; just follow the bouncing ball" (un gran punto que saltaba sobre las palabras que eran sobreimpresionadas en televisión a la canción que Mitch estaba cantando). Los mayores éxitos de Miller con el coro fueron "The Yellow Rose of Texas"\, una versión baterística de la vieja marcha\, y "Colonel Bogey March"\, que más tarde disfrutaría de una renovada popularidad tras su uso en la película The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957). Además de su espectáculo televisivo\, Miller y su coro grabaron varios discos que se vendieron muy bien.    "Mule Train\,"el primer gran éxito de Miller (para Frankie Laine) y la fundación de su carrera\, establecieron el modelo para virtualmente toda la primera década del rock. Las similitudes entre ese tema y\, por ejemplo\, "Leader of the Pack"\, casi no es necesario subrayarlas aquí.  Miller firmó y produjo a muchos importantes artistas especializados en estándares del pop\, como Frankie Laine\, Johnnie Ray\, Ray Conniff\, Percy Faith\, Johnny Mathis\, Tony Bennett\, Guy Mitchell (cuyo pseudónimo en realidad estaba basado en el nombre de Miller)\, y ayudó directamente a las carreras de artistas que ya habían firmado con el sello\, como Doris Day\, Dinah Shore y Jo Stafford por nombrar a unos pocos. Miller se convirtió en uno de los más exitosos productores de música pop de la historia.  Miller es frecuentemente descrito por historiadores del rock como un enemigo del primer rock and roll. Miller hizo echar marcha atrás al contrato que John Hammond le había hecho a Bob Dylan para capitalizar la emergente moda de la música folk. Aunque finalmente perdería su trabajo en Columbia por negarse a producir el tipo de música que estaban comprando los adolescentes\, en principio Miller había intentado contratar a Elvis Presley\, aunque reculó ante las cifras que le pedía el manager de Elvis\, Colonel Tom Parker. Graduado en la Eastman School of Music\, Miller es también un consumado intérprete de oboe y corno inglés. Consiguió algún dinero en los comienzos de su carrera en los años treinta y cuarenta como intéprete de oboe; de hecho\, en esos años\, fue llamado en su calidad de oboísta\, por George Gershwin\, para integrar un conjunto de 55 músicos\, que saldrían de gira\, interpretando sus principales obras de esa época.  También integró\, en 1935\, la orquesta del estreno de "Porgy & Bess". Entre sus más admiradas interpretaciones de estudio dentro del terreno no clásico\, están sus aportes para The Voice of Frank Sinatra y para Bird With Strings de Charlie Parker. Miller recibió el Premio Grammy por toda una vida en 2000.

COL title VAL (Black Gal) Where Did You Sleep Last Night? COL performer VAL Leadbelly	COL video title VAL Sonny Knight & the Lakers - Where Did You Sleep Last Night COL description VAL "Sonny Knight and the Lakers exist in the afterglow that soul luminaries like Sam Cooke and Aretha Franklin created with their raucous\, kinetic\, and supreme live performances. Sonny Knight and the Lakers 'Do It Live'\, from the eponymous group\, is a loving return to the height of live Rhythm and Blues\, with Knight and his band perfectly capturing the uproarious vibe and rebellious musicianship of an era long gone in their first live album release. A year of steady touring through the US and Europe has allowed the group to create a seamless set\, mixing songs from their critically-acclaimed debut studio album\, I’m Still Here\, with a couple covers of classic soul songs from their native Minneapolis\,  and re-imagined bits from Led Zeppelin and James Brown. Recorded in their hometown of Minneapolis at the Dakota Jazz Club over two nights and four performances\, Sonny Knight and the Lakers aim to bring a new focus on the art of the live record. Hoping to add to the rich history of live albums rather than producing something merely derivative\, they set out to reconstruct the ephemeral experience of a live concert and earn a permanent place on your record shelf".

COL title VAL I'll Fly Away COL performer VAL The Charlie Daniels Band	COL video title VAL Carpenters - The Rainbow Connection COL description VAL Recorded in 1981 for the "Made In America" album\, this performance is a work lead by Karen. The song was recorded with just piano\, bass and drums\, and vocals by Karen to introduce the song for the other musicians and to familiarize them with Richard's arrangement. Had the song been completed and included on the album\, other instruments would have been added such as strings and horns\, and later\, Karen would have come back to the studio and recorded a new vocal track. Karen recorded the song at Richard's request\, but simply didn't like the song\, and so the song was never completed..   Years later\, after Karen's death\, fans learned of the track and begged Richard to release it. In an interview\, Richard stated\, "If I ever released it\, Karen would come down and get me!" But twenty years after Karen recorded "Rainbow Connection\," Richard began work on the last Carpenters album\, a Japanese CD entitled "As Time Goes By" released in 2001\, and he decided to complete the song and include it on the CD.   To put this song into historical context\, it was recorded a year after Karen completed her solo album\, an album which she decided to shelve at the urging of A&M. She then returned to the studio to begin recording what turned out to be her last Carpenters album\, "Made In America."   Her solo album has been described as her effort to change her image by breaking away from traditional Carpenters songs and recording songs with more risque lyrics in a higher tone of voice. She may have viewed "Rainbow Connection" which had been introduced by Kermit the Frog in "The Muppet Movie\," as a step back toward the type of song she was trying to break away from. But she obliged Richard by laying down a vocal track\, but ultimately\, she didn't like the song enough to pursue it any further. But her vocals\, however "begrudgingly" they were recorded\, are nearly perfect\, and show her extreme professionalism towards her craft.   Most Carpenter fans like "Rainbow Connection\," but are divided on two aspects of the song: the toy piano and the "angel" voices in the chorus. I like the song just the way it is and it's among one of my favorite Carpenter recordings. Of all the videos I've created using Carpenters songs\, this is the first one that made me cry when I viewed it for the first time after its completion. There's something about it that makes me miss her all the more - I'd like to think that she's happy wherever she is and that she's finally found her rainbow connection.

Feinstein\, accompanied by venerable GRAMMY® Award-winning jazz pianist Alan Broadbent (Charlie Haden\, Diana Krall\, Natalie Cole)\, puts his signature styling on a selection of holiday standards. Now available digitally and in retail stores nationwide\, these sought-after recordings were previously part of a limited release and out of print for over ten years.  No stranger to spreading holiday cheer\, Feinstein’s popular annual holiday concert in New York City is touted by the New York Times to be “as much a Christmas season ritual as catching the Rockettes at Radio City Music Hall or visiting the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree\,” making A Michael Feinstein Christmas a true gem for Feinstein fans as it is the only recorded collection of yuletide songs by the singer.  Long recognized as one of the world’s finest singers and pianists\, Feinstein is also celebrated for his tireless efforts to preserve\, protect and promote the songs and songwriters that shaped the Golden Age of American music. Feinstein founded the Great American Songbook Foundation\, which strives “to bring the music of the Great American Songbook to young people today and to preserve it for future generations.” The foundation is headquartered in Carmel\, Indiana at The Center for the Performing Arts\, where the Midwest-born Feinstein serves as Artistic Director.  Over the course of his non-stop\, 30-plus year career\, Michael Feinstein has wowed millions of fans with his cabaret and concert hall performances\, earned five GRAMMY® nominations\, two EMMY® nods\, and has released nearly an album a year—the majority of which pay tribute to his heroes—Frank Sinatra\, Jimmy Webb\, the Gershwins and  most recently\, André Previn\, with 2013’s Change of Heart: The Songs of André Previn on Concord Records. The prolific performer also hosts a nationally syndicated public radio show\, Song Travels\, and hosted the PBS show Michael Feinstein’s American Songbook. Last summer\, Michael was honored to be named the Principal Pops Conductor at the Pasadena POPS in Southern California\, where he will follow in the footsteps of the great Marvin Hamlisch—certainly a position in which Michael can continue to share his limitless passion for music with the world.

L'auteur de L'écume des jours a su trouver les mots qui sonnent avec grâce. La direction musicale de Laurent De Wild est un "Voyage au Paradis".  Libération -- 2009 -- Bruno Pfeiffer -- Diane chante Vian tel que -- Un météore a explosé la surface tranquille de la lune : son dernier disque "Docteur Boris et Mister Vian". Le travail enduit de baume les oreilles\, puis le reste de la carcasse. C'est tout simplement extra... Un régal. Vian n'aurait sans doute pas hésité à applaudir « Rue de la flemme ». Quel concentré de swing relâché! Quel modèle de grande chanson (tour de force de la traduction)! Pourquoi  citer seulement  le savoureux « Voyage au Paradis » ? Les onze valent le coup. Le disque passe comme un remède à l'imbécillité de la période actuelle... La profondeur légère de l'interprétation s'offre comme un cadeau. Les chorus de Laurent de Wilde\, huit ou seize mesures maxi\, ne goinfrent pas la mise en place. La complicité de l'ensemble se ressent du respect flagrant que se portent les artistes. Le prochain qui me classe Diane Tell dans la variété\, je l'enjoins : jazzons les idées préconçues.

COL title VAL Wishing Well COL performer VAL Siggi Schwarz & Michael Schenker	COL video title VAL Olympic Sideburns - 7 And 7 Is (Love Cover) COL description VAL From '' I've Been Away '' Label: New Rose Records ‎– NEW 54 Format: Vinyl\, 12"\, 45 RPM\, EP Country: France Released: 1985  Tracklist A1 I've Been Away A2 13th Floor B1 7 And 7 Is B2 Fire It Up  Producer – Tony Cohen  ------------------------  "7 and 7 Is" is a song written by Arthur Lee and recorded by his band Love on June 20\, 1966\, at Sunset Sound Recorders in Hollywood. It was produced by Paul A. Rothchild and engineered by Bruce Botnick.  The song was released as the A-side of Elektra single 45605 in July\, 1966. The B-side was "No. Fourteen"\, supposedly the 'answer' to the half-sentence formed by the A-side's title but actually an out-take from the band's earlier recordings.  "7 and 7 Is" made the Billboard Pop Singles chart on July 30\, 1966\, peaking at number 33 during a ten-week chart run and becoming the band's highest-charting hit single. The recording also featured on the band's second album\, Da Capo.  The song drew inspiration from a high school sweetheart of Arthur Lee's\, Anita "Pretty" Billings\, who shared his birthday\, March 7. It also describes Lee's frustration at teenage life - the reference to "in my lonely room I'd sit\, my mind in an ice cream cone" being to wearing (in reality or metaphorically) a dunce's cap.  It took a great deal of work to record\, with Love's drummer\, Alban "Snoopy" Pfisterer\, being challenged with its frantic demands after 30 takes or so\, and being replaced on drums\, intermittently\, by Arthur Lee himself. It is not clear whether the version eventually released features Pfisterer or Lee\, but according to Johnny Echols (lead guitar)\, in an interview in the book Forever Changes (pg 117) stated that the drumming on the record was Pfisterer. The song climaxes in an apocalyptic explosion - the supposed sound of an atom bomb - before a peaceful conclusion\, in a blues form\, which then fades out. Although many listeners thought that the explosion at the end of the song was a reverb unit being kicked or dropped\, it was (according to the engineer Bruce Botnick in "Forever Changes" book\, page 118)\, in actuality\, taken from a sound effects record. He speculated that it was a recording of a gunshot slowed down. (For live performances\, the explosion was reproduced by kicking a reverb unit.)  Music critic Robert Christgau called "7 and 7 Is" "a perfect rocker."  Described as "protopunk"\, it was later covered by numerous bands\, most notably: Ramones\, Alice Cooper\, The Electric Prunes and Rush\, as well as a re-recording by Lee himself.  The song was used in the film Bottle Rocket\, handpicked by director Wes Anderson and music composer Mark Mothersbaugh. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0
COL title VAL Everlasting Love COL performer VAL The Senate	COL video title VAL Shirley Bassey - Everything I Have Is Yours (1962 Recording) COL description VAL 1962 (Here is a beautiful song from Shirley Bassey's 1962 LP titled\, 'Let's Face The Music with Nelson Riddle and his Orchestra.    ABOUT this song: "Everything I Have Is Yours" is a popular song.  The music was written by Burton Lane\, the lyrics by Harold Adamson. The song was published in 1933. It was first sung by Art Jarrett in the 1933 film Dancing Lady.  ABOUT the LP\, Let's Face The Music: Let's Face the Music is the sixth Shirley Bassey studio album\, released in 1962\, and arranged by Nelson Riddle.  Kenneth Hume\, Shirley Bassey's husband and manager wrote the sleeve notes for this album\, in which he gives an insight into how this album came to being: "When Vic Lewis booked Nelson Riddle for a tour with Shirley\, we were all very excited; being great fans of Nelson Riddle's from way back...so when someone suggested them doing an LP together\, we thought that this would not be possible\, remembering that Nelson was under contract with another recording company."  Nelson Riddle was under contract to Capitol Records at the time\, so Bassey's producer Norman Newell went about to secure his services for an album. While on the tour\, Bassey\, Riddle\, and Bassey's music director Raymond Long discussed what form the album should take. Shortly after the tour was completed\, the recording sessions began.  This album was issued in the US as Shirley Bassey Sings The Hit Song From "Oliver!" on the United Artists label\, with a slightly different track listing and alternative recordings. "I Can't Get You Out of My Mind" was replaced by "As Long As He Needs Me"\, and "Imagination"\, "All of Me" and "All the Things You Are" appear on Oliver! in alternative versions. The alternative versions have not yet been released in the UK and are still not available on CD.  The UK album was re-issued in 1971 as What Now My Love on the EMI Music For Pleasure (MFP) label\, it reached number 17 in the UK album charts.  LYRICS: Everything I have is yours  You're part of me  Everything I have is yours  My destiny   I would gladly give the sun to you  If the sun were only mine  I would gladly give the earth to you  And the stars that shine   Everything that I posses  I offer you   Make my dream of happiness come true  I'd be happy just to spent my life  Waiting at your beck and call   Everything I have is yours  My life\, my all   I'd be happy just to spent my life  Waiting at your beck and call   Everything I have is yours  My life\, my all  Special Thanks to Pieter\,  Astrid and others from the Shirley Bassey blog\, Tal from the Diamond Bassey website\, and all those who have contributed wonderful pictures of Shirley!

This was her 10th LP in just 15 years as a professional singer. If I Give My Heart To You was a US Top 5 hit in 1954 for Doris Day. DANA's (superior) version made #27 in Ireland. She wrote in her autobiography about the time she first saw Doris Day in America in 1970: "But the greatest highlight for me was when I saw Doris Day in person. She came to our hotel for lunch\, on her bike\, dressed in a pair of cut-off cotton trousers and a T-shirt\, with her blond hair pulled back in a pony tail."  If I give my heart to you Will you handle it with care Will you promise you'll be true to me And in every way be fair  If I give my heart to you Will you give me all your love Will you always treat me tenderly Swear by stars that shine above  And will you sigh with me when I'm sad And smile with me when I'm glad And always be as you are with me tonight  Think it over and be sure Please don't answer till you do When you promise all these things to me Then I'll give my heart to you  Think it over and be sure Please don't answer till you do When you promise all these things to me Then I'll give my heart to you  If you promise all these things to me Then I'll give my heart to you  Words and music by Jimmy Brewster\, Jimmie Crane and Al Jacobs.

Pubblicata nel 1938\, la canzone fu inserita nel musical di Broadway "This Way" \,in cui venne  eseguita dal cantante Tamara Drasin\, che aveva qualche anno prima cantato "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes". Il brano è uno standard jazz\, ed è statoinciso da numerosi artisti nel corso degli anni. Il tema musicale ha potere emotivo\, ed è stato molto amato durante la seconda guerra mondiale\, quando divenne un inno per coloro che prestavano servizio all'estero (dai soldati britannici e  americani). La versione più ricordata è quella di Billie Holiday (1944) e altrettanto nota è quella di Bing Crosby dello stesso anno\, dal film omonimo con  Ginger Rogers and Joseph Cotten. Mina la propone nel suo album "12 American Songbook" del 2012.

COL title VAL サイモンスミスと踊る熊 [Simon Smith and the Amazing Dancing Bear] COL performer VAL Kirinji	COL video title VAL Hal Kemp Skinnay Ennis - You're the Top 1934 - Cole Porter COL description VAL "You're The Top" is a Cole Porter song from the 1934 musical Anything Goes. It is about a man and a woman who take turns complimenting each other. The best selling version was Paul Whiteman's Victor single\, which made the top five. It was the most popular song from Anything Goes at the start with hundreds of parodies. The lyrics are particularly significant because they offer a snapshot as to what was highly prized in the mid-1930s\, and demonstrate Porter's rhyming ability Hal Kemp (March 27\, 1904 -- December 21\, 1940) was a jazz alto saxophonist\, clarinetist\, bandleader\, composer\, and arranger. He was born in Marion\, Alabama and died in Madera\, California following an auto accident. Art Jarrett took on leadership of Kemp's orchestra in 1941. His major recordings were "There's a Small Hotel"\, "Where or When"\, "This Year's Kisses"\, "When I'm With You"\, "Got a Date With an Angel" and "Three Little Fishies". On December 19\, 1940\, while driving from Los Angeles to a booking in San Francisco\, his car collided head-on with another. Kemp broke a leg and several ribs and suffered a punctured lung. He developed pneumonia while in the hospital and died two days later. Edgar Clyde "Skinnay" Ennis\, Jr. (August 13\, 1907 - June 3\, 1963) was an American jazz and pop music bandleader and singer. Ennis was born in Salisbury\, North Carolina and met Hal Kemp while attending the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill. He joined Kemp's orchestra as a drummer and vocalist in the late 1920s\, playing with him through 1937 including one tour of Europe in 1930. Following this Ennis put together his own band\, which became a popular ensemble in Hollywood films. "Got a Date With an Angel" was his theme song. During this time Gil Evans was one of his arrangers. He also did comedy routines\, and landed a job on Bob Hope's radio program from 1938 through 1946. He conducted his own service band during World War II and returned to Hollywood bandleading at the war's end. Toward the end of the 1950s Ennis's career had faded\, and he worked mostly in hotels in the Los Angeles area. He choked to death on a bone while eating dinner at a restaurant in Beverly Hills in 1963. COL channel name VAL warholsoup100	0

It was written in August and September 1979\, and debuted when the band supported Buzzcocks on their UK tour in September and October 1979. It is one of the few songs in which singer Ian Curtis played guitar (albeit somewhat minimally). The lyrics ostensibly reflect the problems in Ian Curtis's marriage to Deborah Curtis\, as well as his general frame of mind in the time leading up to his suicide in May 1980.  The song was first released in April 1980 and\, after Curtis's suicide that May\, became the band's first chart hit\, reaching number 13 in the UK. It also debuted at #1 in New Zealand in June 1981. The band postponed their US tour after his death\, performed a few short sets as The No-Names\, then finally renamed the group as New Order. "Love" was re-released in 1983 and reached number 19 on the UK charts and re-appeared at #3 in New Zealand during March 1984. In November 1988\, it made one more Top 40 appearance in New Zealand\, peaking at #39. "Love Will Tear Us Apart" appears on the Substance compilation album. It was first recorded for a John Peel session in November 1979\, then re-recorded in January 1980 and March 1980. It is the latter version that appears on Substance. The January 1980 version originally appeared as the single's B-side.  Popularity  "Love Will Tear Us Apart" has remained popular and was listed by NME magazine as the best single of all time in 2002. The song was listed by Rolling Stone magazine at number 179 in its top 500 songs of all time. In May 2007\, NME placed it at number 19 in its list of the 50 Greatest Indie Anthems Ever\, one place ahead of another Joy Division song\, "Transmission". The song reached number 1 in the inaugural Triple J Hottest 100 music poll of 1989 and again in 1990. When being interviewed for New Order Story\, Neil Tennant of the Pet Shop Boys stated that "Love Will Tear Us Apart" was his favourite pop song of all time. He also mentioned several New Order songs in the same dialogue.  Films  The song has also been used in television programs and in films\, such as the 2001 film Donnie Darko\, in a pivotal scene before Donnie has to leave his girlfriend in order to save her. The song is included in the indie film Wristcutters\, which takes place in an afterlife for people who have committed suicide. It was also included in a film about the Manchester music scene\, 24 Hour Party People\, during several scenes about the band and Curtis's suicide. It is heard in the Doctor Who episode "School Reunion". The film Series 7: The Contenders features a music video for the song which characters explain as being part of a school project. Their homemade music video is in the style of a cheaply made '80s video with actors dressed in stereotypical goth fashion. In the sci-fi comedy radio series Undone\, the song is performed as a chime on an ice cream van. On November 11\, 2009 it was featured in the opening scene of episode 7 of season 5 ("The Performer") of the television series Criminal Minds. "Love Will Tear Us Apart" was also featured at the beginning of UK police drama\, Silent Witness in the episode "Voids: Part 1".  Cover versions  "Love Will Tear Us Apart" was eventually performed by New Order (though not for 18 years after Curtis's suicide) and has been covered by many artists including: Thom Yorke\, Mark Owen\, Björk\, Nerina Pallot\, Hawksley Workman\, Calexico\, Bloc Party\, The Cure\, Swans\, Unbroken\, Broken Social Scene\, Nouvelle Vague\, Heavens\, Fall Out Boy\, José González\, Red Mecca\, Yat-Kha\, Stanton Miranda\, U2\, John Frusciante\, Arcade Fire\, REVERE\, Squarepusher\, Honeyroot\, Chris Edwards\, Susanna and the Magical Orchestra\, Moonspell\, The Blood Divine\, Simple Minds\, Oysterband with June Tabor\, Paul Young\, Jamie Cullum\, Evelyn Evelyn and In the Nursery.  The song "Let's Dance to Joy Division" by UK act The Wombats was inspired by "Love Will Tear Us Apart"\, and includes "let love tear us apart" in the lyrics; similarly\, Kasper Bjørke's song "Alcatrez" references "Love Will Tear Us Apart": "Do you think it's true that our love will tear us apart?"  Serbian rock musician\, journalist and writer Dejan Cukić wrote about "Love Will Tear Us Apart" as one of the forty-six songs that changed history of popular music in his 2007 book 45 obrtaja: Priče o pesmama.  Broken Social Scene's cover was featured in the soundtrack for The Time Traveler's Wife . COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

Jimmy Lytell was a member from 1922 to 1925 and Miff Mole as standout musicians in the group.  Jimmy Durante played piano (with Ladd's Black Aces) while both Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey were members of the Original Memphis Five. The group made many recordings between 1921 and 1931\, sometimes under different names\, including Ladd's Black Aces (from 1921 until 1924) and The Cotton Pickers. The name Original Memphis Five was first used in 1920\, and applied to various small groups of white musicians throughout the decade. Both Red Nichols and Miff Mole later led their own groups named Original Memphis Five. Phil Napoleon\, however\, would continue using the group name until 1990.   In the first two decades of the 20th century\, the social dance was passing through enormous transformations both in its form and spiritual content. From the waltz or a tango - which were the intimate au pair experience - it was developing towards a hot collective\, almost tribal dance imported from Africa and the Caribbean. "Coarse"\, "boorish"\, "vulgar" - those are only some from vast collection of insults the new dances were determined by the journals. Machicha\, shimmy - these were the first swallows of the dancefloor entertainment. Yet\, it wasn't until 1925 - when came King Charleston and took power - and the world learned what it might be a collective dance madness.   Shimmy - which in 1919 was launched exaequo by two Broadway stars: Gilda Gray and Bee Palmer - was an earlier version of the Charleston\, more elaborate with the elements of oriental dance. The name "shimmy" comes from one of the figures of Arabic belly dancing. Gilda Gray however - who was Polish (Marianna Michalska born in Cracow\, Poland) - supported the rumors - supposedly for self-promotional purposes - that name "shimmy" comes from her imperfect English\, when preparing to go on stage Gilda spoke to her dresser: - Gimmie dat' sheemiee' (chemise). For these and other reasons\, the slideshow in this film presents a small collection of lovely covers of the shimmy-sheet music from various places in the world.  For those who want to see\, how DID REALLY look the shimmy-dance\, go and see two fantastic shimmy-renditions by the Budapest Operetta artrists\, from 2012 and 2010 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBp8yqpSOgA  and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExjcIaAAMug and also a very good Russian version from 2010 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp1Hzm803q0 . All are danced to Emmerich Kalman's famous shimmy "Fräulein\, woll'n Sie Shimmy tanzen?" from operette "Bayadera". COL channel name VAL 240252	1

COL title VAL Only Love Can Break Your Heart COL performer VAL The Corrs	COL video title VAL Roland Shaw -- La Bamba COL description VAL Roland Shaw\, born Roland Edgar Shaw-Tomkins\, (26 May 1920 - 11 May 2012) was an English composer\, musical arranger\, and orchestra leader. Shaw\, who was born in Leicester attended the Trinity College of Music and served in the Royal Air Force in World War II leading RAF No 1 Band of the Middle East Forces. Following wartime service he arranged music for Ted Heath\, Teddy Foster\, Mantovani and many others.

In December 1964 his orchestra released an album of cover versions of Themes from the James Bond Thrillers to coincide with the American release of Goldfinger. The popularity of Shaw's arrangements of Bond themes led to More Themes from the James Bond Thrillers for the release ofThunderball with tracks from both albums released on a UK album called James Bond in Action. In 1966 Shaw's orchestra performed Themes for Secret Agents.Themes from the James Bond Thrillers Vol.3/More James Bond in Action followed the release of Casino Royale and You Only Live Twice in 1967. Shaw came back in 1971 for The Return of James Bond/The Phase 4 World of Spy Thrillers for the release of Sean Connery's return as Bond in Diamonds Are Forever. Shaw recruited guitarist Vic Flick to repeat his guitar playing on the Gypsy Camp track. Shaw arranged music for films such as Summer Holiday (1963) and The Secret of My Success (1965) and wrote the score for Straight on Till Morning.

COL title VAL You Belong to Me COL performer VAL Jonny Blu	COL video title VAL AC/DC Tribute - Leslie King - You Shook Me All Night Long COL description VAL From the cd Backed in Black. Acoustic versions with female voices.  ---  Female acoustic versions of AC/DC songs? Yes\, it's a gimmick\, but it works on its own terms. And it's a sweet irony\, considering AC/DC's music has always been macho\, swaggering boys' anthems. So what happens when you put an army of Lilith Fair-ready female artists to these tunes? Something pretty good\, actually. In fact\, the best track on here is the opener\, Sunny Hodge's unbelievably sweet\, feminine "Hells Bells". The original\, with its spare\, ominous electric guitar riff and slow grinding groove\, is the last song I'd expected to work in this context\, but Hodge turns the riff into an almost primitive-blues acoustic riff while her thin\, sweet voice turns the cock-rock lyrics into something so bizarre\, you just have to grin. Single-name artist Patty does a good job turning "Highway to Hell" into a country-rock busking tune (I've sung that song with this arrangement\, myself)\, and Leslie King is also great on "You Shook Me All Night Long". "Back in Black"\, though\, suffers from cover artist Reyo Bikkin's inability to hit those Brian Johnson high notes on the chorus\, rendering those feral "Back in black!" hooks rather flaccid.  Strange and weirdly interesting. My big gripe is that\, excluding the two "bonus tracks" ending the disc ("Highway to Hell" and "For Those about to Rock")\, they did every song off the Back in Black album\, thus rendering the song selection very limited. Imagined if they'd had someone do "Rising Power"\, "Thunderstruck" or "Let There Be Rock" with an acoustic guitar and female vocals!   Review written by D.

Natel / Claude-Michel Schönberg.  (Fantine) J'avais rêvé d'une autre vie Mais la vie a tué mes rêves Comme on étouffe les derniers cris D'un animal que l'on achève  J'avais rêvé d'un coeur si grand Que le mien puisse y trouver place Mais mon premier prince charmant Fut l'assassin de mon enfance  J'ai payé de toutes mes larmes La rançon d'un petit bonheur À une société qui désarme La victime\, et pas le voleur  J'avais rêvé d'un seul amour Durant jusqu'à la fin du monde Dont on ne fait jamais le tour Aussi vrai que la terre est ronde  J'avais rêvé d'une autre vie Mais la vie a tué mes rêves À peine commencée\, elle finit Comme un court printemps qui s'achève  J'avais rêvé d'une autre vie Mais la vie a tué mes rêves À peine commencée\, elle finit Comme un court printemps qui s'achève  La nuit\, la nuit\, je sombre en mon corps Et je m'abandonne à des sinistres corps à corps La nuit\, la nuit\, pour deux pièces d'or Quand ils font jaillir en moi leur pitoyable effort Ils ne savent pas qu'ils font l'amour avec la mort !

COL title VAL Creole Love Call COL performer VAL The Blues Band	COL video title VAL Carpenters - The Rainbow Connection COL description VAL Recorded in 1981 for the "Made In America" album\, this performance is a work lead by Karen. The song was recorded with just piano\, bass and drums\, and vocals by Karen to introduce the song for the other musicians and to familiarize them with Richard's arrangement. Had the song been completed and included on the album\, other instruments would have been added such as strings and horns\, and later\, Karen would have come back to the studio and recorded a new vocal track. Karen recorded the song at Richard's request\, but simply didn't like the song\, and so the song was never completed..   Years later\, after Karen's death\, fans learned of the track and begged Richard to release it. In an interview\, Richard stated\, "If I ever released it\, Karen would come down and get me!" But twenty years after Karen recorded "Rainbow Connection\," Richard began work on the last Carpenters album\, a Japanese CD entitled "As Time Goes By" released in 2001\, and he decided to complete the song and include it on the CD.   To put this song into historical context\, it was recorded a year after Karen completed her solo album\, an album which she decided to shelve at the urging of A&M. She then returned to the studio to begin recording what turned out to be her last Carpenters album\, "Made In America."   Her solo album has been described as her effort to change her image by breaking away from traditional Carpenters songs and recording songs with more risque lyrics in a higher tone of voice. She may have viewed "Rainbow Connection" which had been introduced by Kermit the Frog in "The Muppet Movie\," as a step back toward the type of song she was trying to break away from. But she obliged Richard by laying down a vocal track\, but ultimately\, she didn't like the song enough to pursue it any further. But her vocals\, however "begrudgingly" they were recorded\, are nearly perfect\, and show her extreme professionalism towards her craft.   Most Carpenter fans like "Rainbow Connection\," but are divided on two aspects of the song: the toy piano and the "angel" voices in the chorus. I like the song just the way it is and it's among one of my favorite Carpenter recordings. Of all the videos I've created using Carpenters songs\, this is the first one that made me cry when I viewed it for the first time after its completion. There's something about it that makes me miss her all the more - I'd like to think that she's happy wherever she is and that she's finally found her rainbow connection.

COL title VAL Sweet Little Jesus Boy COL performer VAL Trisha Yearwood	COL video title VAL DAVID RUFFIN -"(IF LOVING YOU IS WRONG) I DON'T WANT TO BE RIGHT" (1973) COL description VAL David Ruffin's third and self-titled solo offering was in many ways a collaborative effort with Bobby Miller\, who produced the David Ruffin (1973) album and supplied eight of its ten tracks. There is a conspicuous dichotomy between the personas that Ruffin portrays throughout the project and the man whose fractious relationship with Motown had practically cost him his association with the label. Things had gotten so bad\, they permanently shelved what should have been Ruffin's third LP. Motown simply refused to put it out until cooler heads eventually prevailed some three decades later. He was likewise no longer afforded access to "A-list" material and support musicians either. While his previous outings had sold respectably\, they certainly were no match for the likes of Stevie Wonder\, Marvin Gaye\, or even his former bandmates in the Temptations whose "Papa Was a Rollin' Stone" had been a crossover pop chart topper months earlier. "The Rovin' Kind" gets things underway bearing an almost emblematic mid-tempo Motown groove. Ruffin's once crystalline voice now endures the sonic substantiation of chronic drug and alcohol addiction. In a perverse way\, the combination of his aging falsetto\, coupled with the rough-hewn timbre\, actually enhance his role in the ballad "Common Man\," as well as the blithe and bouncy "I'm Just a Mortal Man" with the Andantes providing the equally amicable background vocals. The update of "(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want to Be Right" -- a seductive side that Luther Ingram had considerable success with the previous year -- is personalized as Ruffin confides in the opening that he is "a man in desperation" backing it up with the plea "can't you help the situation"? His short rhythmically spoken intro continues as he owns up to his reputation as a "wild child\," begging the question whether Ruffin is actually in or out of character. The Philly-style soul of the Kenny Gamble/Leon Huff written "I Miss You" suits the heart-wrenching adaptation. The six-plus minute gritty social commentary "Blood Donors Needed (Give All You Can)" is a starkly accurate portrayal of inner-city life. Perhaps in the escapism mentality of the times\, it failed to make an impact on the singles charts. Yet\, the lack of a marketable 45 seems to have had little relevance on R&B record buyers as David Ruffin made it into the Top Five album survey -- although it did not fare nearly as well\, peaking at number 168 on the pop side. Those slipping figures are endemic indicators of the increasing lack of interest that Motown would invest in Ruffin's future endeavors. COL channel name VAL MANNY MORA	0

COL title VAL Old Time Religion COL performer VAL Jackie Wilson and Linda Hopkins	COL video title VAL The Charlie Daniels Band - Statesboro Blues.wmv COL description VAL Tailgate Party This CD contains some of the greatest rock songs of all time. Originally made legendary by some of the south's best rock bands\, Charlie adds his own unique sound to each song. Originals\, live and studio versions make this collection live up to its' name by being a great one to pull out during a "Tailgate Party."   Description      13 Tracks previously released in 1999     Engineered\, Produced and Mixed by: Ron W. Griffin     Executive Producer: David Corlew  Guide Review - Charlie Daniels Band - Tailgate Party  Included on this very southern rock flavored collection are live versions of "The Legend of Wooley Swamp" and "The Devil Went Down to Georgia." With both songs being so well known and played a gazillion times\, it was refreshing to hear them live and just slightly different from what we are normally accustomed to.  "The South's Gonna Do It Again" had an added bonus to it by having a very early on in his career performance by Keith Urban\, showing us some very impressive guitar solo's. Remakes of ZZ Top's "Sharp Dressed Man" and Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Freebird" were very captivating and showed off some incredible fiddle playing by Charlie. Probably one of my most favorites was CDB's remake of the song made famous by Hootie and the Blowfish\, "Let Her Cry." Charlie has always been well known for his playing but under rated for his vocals. This song shows off just how well he can deliver some very heartfelt emotions and I really enjoyed listening to this new version.  If you have ever appreciated CDB\, you will really like this release. If for nothing else\, the diversity of the genre's and CDB being able to add the country sound without destroying the memory of the song.  Track Listing  1 The South's Gonna Do It  3:57 2 Pride and Joy  4:03 3 Can't You See  6:26 4 Let Her Cry  4:00 5 Homesick  3:53 6 Keep Your Hands to Yourself  3:12 7 Statesboro Blues  4:22 8 Peach County Jamboree  3:18 9 Sharp Dressed Man  4:46 10 Free Bird  6:38 11 The Legend of Wooley Swamp [Live]  5:21 12 El Toreador [Live]  5:26 13 The Devil Went Down to Georgia [Live]  3:44 COL channel name VAL SOUTHERN REBEL	0

COL title VAL Clair COL performer VAL The Singers Unlimited	COL video title VAL Sarah Vaughan - These Foolish Things COL description VAL The Lonely Hours\, Sarah Vaughan's contribution to the genre of saloon song LPs\, doesn't have a stellar selection of material — although of course nearly anything recorded by one of America's foremost jazz interpreters is worth hearing. Add to that the special treat of Benny Carter — the seminal altoist who'd been contributing charts to the hottest big bands since 1928 — occupying the arranger's chair\, and The Lonely Hours becomes a very intriguing proposition. Carter's refined arrangements and ensemble playing don't exactly reinforce the isolation of the title\, but Vaughan sounds excellent on "I'll Never Be the Same\," "These Foolish Things\," and "If I Had You\," lightly caressing the notes. For "You're Driving Me Crazy" and "What'll I Do\," she cleverly mirrors the comic frustration embodied in Carter's flügelhorn/tuba ensemble. Hopefully\, Carter wasn't responsible for the occasionally canned sound of the strings; The Lonely Hours is a solid match of vocalist and arranger in most respects\, with only the quality of the material weighing it down slightly.

COL title VAL These Boots Are Made for Walking COL performer VAL B.E.F. featuring Paula Yates	COL video title VAL Billy Eckstine -- I Could Write a Book COL description VAL Billy Eckstine (Pittsburgh\, 8 de julio de 1914 - Pittsburgh\, 8 de marzo de 1993) fue un cantante estadounidense de jazz y música pop. Poseedor de una voz de barítono\, fue durante los años cuarenta una figura carismática de la música popular negra\, al liderar una de las primeras big band de bop y convertirse en el primer cantante negro de baladas románticas (fue llamado el Sinatra negro). Con el paso de los años\, su influencia ha sido considerable en el ámbito del soul y el rhythm and blues.  Eckstine comenzó a cantar a los nueve años y participó en numerosos espectáculos para aficionados. Aunque su vocación había sido la de jugador de fútbol americano\, una grave lesión lo recondujo hacia el mundo de la música. Tras diversos trabajos al oeste de Chicago a finales de los años treinta\, Eckstine fue invitado por Earl Hines para unirse a su Grand Terrace Orchestra en 1939.  Aunque sus primeros éxitos fueron canciones triviales como "Jelly\, Jelly" y "The Jitney Man"\, grabó también varios estándares como "Stormy Monday". Hacia 1943\, se acompañaba de estrellas como Dizzy Gillespie\, Charlie Parker y Sarah Vaughan. Tras formar su propia banda ese año\, contrató a los tres y gradualmente se hizo con más figuras modernas y con futuras estrellas: Wardell Gray\, Dexter Gordon\, Miles Davis\, Kenny Dorham\, Fats Navarro y Art Blakey\, así como con arreglistas como Tadd Dameron y Gil Fuller. La Billy Eckstine Orchestra fue la primera big band bop\, y su líder reflejaba las innovaciones bop adaptando sus armonías vocales a las baladas normales. A pesar del matiz moderno del grupo\, Eckstine encabezó las listas frecuentemente a mediados de los cuarenta\, con temas como "A Cottage for Sale" y "Prisoner of Love". En las giras por Europa y América\, el cantante tocaba también la trompeta\, el trombón de válvulas y la guitarra.  Forzado a disolver la orquesta en 1947 tras haber formado la suya propia Gillespie\, Eckstine realizó una transición hacia un estilo más baladístico y con arreglos de cuerda. Grabó más de una docena de éxitos a finales de los cuarenta\, entre lo que se incluyen "My Foolish Heart" y "I Apologize". Se hizo popular en Gran Bretaña\, obteniendo un gran éxito durante los cincuenta con temas como "No One But You" y "Gigi"\, así como con sus dúos con Sarah Vaughan. Eckstine regresaría a sus raíces jazzísticas ocasionalmente\, grabando con Vaughan\, Count Basie y Quincy Jones\, y grabando un LP en directo\, No Cover\, No Minimum\, en el que interpretaba algunos solos de trompeta. Grabó varios discos para Mercury y Roulette a comienzos de los sesenta y publicó en Motown algunos discos de estándares a mediados de esa década. Tras grabar muy espaciadamente en los setenta\, Eckstine hizo su última grabación (Billy Eckstine Sings with Benny Carter) en 1986. Murió por un ataque al corazón en 1993.

He did splendidly for a while\, and the production values he learned playing in rock-inflected settings show clearly on his first kids recording. By the Light of the Moon is most surely a country recording\, but it has all the driving rhythmic energy of an elegantly mastered rock album. The drums sound fat and still crisp\, the guitars bright. Daniels's voice\, especially during the interludes where he speaks about the music\, reveals a timeworn huskiness that will charm kids looking for a cowboy to sing to them. The songs emphasize the old\, with "John Henry" and "I'm an Old Cowhand" standing out. The latter includes Daniels playing short fiddle solos that cut a nice\, fresh path through the tune. A sonically splashy session indeed\, By the Light of the Moon has enough old-timey vibrance to merit a spot in any roots-oriented kids collection.  Song Title    1. Get Along\, Little Dogies 3:26  2. Cowboy Logic 4:33  3. I'm an Old Cowhand (from the Rio Grande) 3:32  4. Old Chisholm Trail 4:47  5. Sixteen Tons 2:58  6. Back in the Saddle Again 3:11  7. John Henry 3:56  8. Top Hand 4:04  9.

COL title VAL On the Sunny Side of the Street COL performer VAL Barbara Cook	COL video title VAL Halie Loren - What A Wonderful World COL description VAL Dedicated to children in every war-torn and oppressed part of Planet Earth.  I sincerely hope and pray that one day you will get to see the 'wonderful' side of this world.  ** Halie Loren - I love you and the way you revitalize the classics.  Thank you and wish you all the best in your career.  My gratitude to all the uploaders of the visuals used in this video.  ** Don't we all love the hope and optimism in this classic.  Obviously\, when it was written and recorded back in 1967\, the world was nothing like today\, even though it was at the height of Vietnam War.  Wouldn't you agree with me that in about 5 decades since\, this song should be reworked and re-titled as 'What A Horrible World.'  Fortunate are you who live in a very peaceful land away from the sight and sound of atrocity\, or if you have an option to not watch/read any news.  The original version by Louis Armstrong would still make sense and stay true.  I made this video two months ago and was waiting to upload.  In fact\, I didn't even want to upload it now\, or maybe ever\, because the words and content sound insincere\, faking\, and misleading.  Every one of my videos was inspired by someone or something.  This one was initially inspired by several hateful events that occurred to me.  It was made to comfort myself and to put some hope and optimism back in my heart.    Just as I was recovering\, the image of the lifeless body of a Syrian refugee boy (his name was Aylan Kurdi) on a Turkish beach reaffirmed how this song sounds more like an utter lie than just a simple empty and false promise of hope.  Please take it however you like.  If this video helps restore your optimism\, I am happy.  If it makes you feel worse\, you have my apologies.  As for me\, it hasn't made me feel better.  The news that the SAT scores are now at the lowest level in 10 years\, the fact that boss has just complained to me last night that kids nowadays can't even spell simple words while no one in the position of authority watches out for the future of these children make me sadder.  Worse\, looking around myself\, I see people keep escalating their pursuit of destruction of other people groups; some stir up more and more hatred based on religious beliefs.  I have to ask myself if I dare to believe that this world is a wonderful one.  As of now\, you don't want to know my answer.  ** No copyright infringement intended on video clips\, still photos\, and music. Made for entertainment purposes without financial gain.

Available in physical form direct from website http://HistoryofRnB.net   Download from   Amazon http://www.amazon.co.uk/Those-Hoodlum-Friends-Coasters-Stereo/dp/B00BR0QU6A/ref=dm_cd_album_lnk  iTunes https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/those-hoodlum-friends-coasters/id609884465    Stream from Spotify http://open.spotify.com/album/6IDmQkLUjCQe6poBO4izrg   The Coasters had the benefit of recording in the best studios\, backed by the best musicians and produced by the top producers of their generation\, Leiber and Stoller. Naturally\, they were required to run through as many takes of each song as was necessary to satisfy the exacting demands of their mentors. Luckily for us\, many of these alternate takes have survived. Mono was the standard recording format until the late 1960s\, but many of the big selling artists also recorded alternate versions specifically for the stereo market\, which was targeted to the discerning adult listener.     Disc One features all the alternate stereo versions of Coasters songs that were issued at the time on album and subsequently on CD. Disc Two takes you deep into the heart of Coasters sessions with composite tracks which combine studio chatter together with the finest moments from various different takes. This disc contains several outtakes which have until now been unavailable anywhere and gives an invaluable insight into the genesis of many well-loved tracks and also into the character and working practice of the Coasters and of their producers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller.     The accompanying 24-page booklet includes many rare photos and an exhaustive session discography by Claus Röhnisch. A collection for Coasters and early rock 'n' roll aficionados!

Lyrics: I was a stranger in the city Out of town were the people I knew I had that feeling of self pity What to do\, what to do\, what to do? The outlook was decidedly blue But as I walked through the foggy streets alone It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known A foggy day\, in London town\, it had me low\, and it had me down\, I viewed the morning\, with much alarm\, the British Museum\, had lost its charm\, How long I wondered\, could this thing last\, but the age of miracles\, it hadn't past\, And suddenly\, I saw you standing right there\, And in foggy London town\, the sun was shining everywhere.

COL title VAL Blue Velvet COL performer VAL The Lettermen	COL video title VAL Hard Hearted Hannah (HOT!) - Jeffries and his Rialto Orchestra COL description VAL It's not easy to find any '20's version of "Hard Hearted Hannah"  and this is one of the best. What makes this rendition special is the trumpet solo which I referred to in my introduction\, by Frank Guarente\, (from 2.07).  Guarente led the Georgians and toured Europe around this time. He was to be featured with the Savoy Orpheans later. Leslie Jeffries delivers this delightful tune with aplomb\, from October 1924\, when the 20's were beginning to roar.

COL title VAL The Shadow of Your Smile COL performer VAL Tony Bennett	COL video title VAL Betty Carter - Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye (Bet-Car Records 1982) COL description VAL "Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye" is a song with lyrics and music by Cole Porter. It was introduced in 1944 in Billy Rose's musical revue\, Seven Lively Arts. It is interesting to note that in the phrase "change from major to minor\," Mr. Porter begins with an Ab major chord and ends with an Ab minor one\, cleverly matching words and music. The song has since become a jazz standard after gaining popularity in the late 1950s and early 1960s.  Many artists have replaced the apostrophe in "ev'ry" with an "e" and have combined "time" to form the more common "everytime."  Betty Carter (born Lillie Mae Jones\, May 16\, 1929 -- September 26\, 1998) was an American jazz singer known for her improvisational technique\, scatting abilities\, and other complex musical abilities that demonstrated her vocal talent and imaginative interpretation of lyrics and melodies. Vocalist Carmen McRae once remarked\, "there's really only one jazz singer - only one: Betty Carter."  Carter continued to perform\, tour\, and record\, as well as search for new talent until she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in the summer of 1998. Betty Carter died on September 26\, 1998\, at the age of 69\, and was later cremated.  Carter often recruited young accompanists for performances and recordings\, insisting that she "learned a lot from these young players\, because they're raw and they come up with things that I would never think about doing." 1993 was Carter's biggest year of innovation\, creating a program called Jazz Ahead\, which took 20 students who were given the opportunity to spend an entire week training and composing with Carter\, a program that still exists to this day and is hosted in The Kennedy Center.  Betty Carter is considered responsible for discovering great jazz talent\, her list including such names as John Hicks\, Curtis Lundy\, Mulgrew Miller\, Cyrus Chestnut\, Dave Holland\, Stephen Scott\, Kenny Washington\, Benny Green and more.  Betty's accompanied by David Amram (Arranger & Conductor)\, Curtis Lundy (Bass)\, Lewis Nash (Drums)\, Khalid Moss (Piano)\, Jerry Dodgion (Saxophone [Alto]).  Everytime we say goodbye\, I die a little I wonder why a little  When you're near\, feels like spring  Everytime we say goodbye\, I die a little Everytime we say goodbye\, I wonder why a little Why the Gods above me\, who must be in the know How could they think so little of me\, that they allow you to go  When you're near\, there's such an air of spring about it I can hear a lark somewhere\, begin to sing about it There's no love song finer\, but how strange the change from major to minor Everytime we say goodbye Everytime we say goodbye\, I cry COL channel name VAL RoundMidnightTV	0

Buy the CD\, well worth it.  STEAL AWAY was nominated for a 1996 Grammy Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Performance\, Individual Or Group. "Go Down\, Moses" was nominated for a Grammy for Best Jazz Instrumental Solo.  From the outset of his career with Ornette Coleman\, through his work with pianist Keith Jarrett\, his own Liberation Music Orchestra and collaborations with the likes of Paul Motian\, Hampton Hawes\, Chet Baker\, Carlos Paredes and Ginger Baker\, bassist Charlie Haden has always accorded the spiritual component of music greater importance than its technical considerations.  Haden's finest work has always focused on the most intimate\, humanistic principles: freedom\, justice\, quality. In pianist Hank Jones\, Haden encounters a collaborator and fellow traveller whose musical instincts are every inch as elegant and refined as his own. And in the rich public domain of materials which make up STEAL AWAY\, Haden and Jones take on an oral (and moral) tradition of music that has been inspiring listeners since before the time of the underground railroad.  Recorded at Radio Canada\, Montreal\, Canada on June 29 & 30\, 1994. Includes liner notes by Maurice Jackson\, Charlie Haden and Abbey Lincoln.  Personnel: Hank Jones (piano).  Audio Mixer: Jay Newland.  Liner Note Author: Maurice Jackson.  Recording information: Radio Canada\, Montreal\, Canada (06/29/1994/06/30/1994).  Photographer: Walker Evans.

Naturally\, they were required to run through as many takes of each song as was necessary to satisfy the exacting demands of their mentors. Luckily for us\, many of these alternate takes have survived. Mono was the standard recording format until the late 1960s\, but many of the big selling artists also recorded alternate versions specifically for the stereo market\, which was targeted to the discerning adult listener.     Disc One features all the alternate stereo versions of Coasters songs that were issued at the time on album and subsequently on CD. Disc Two takes you deep into the heart of Coasters sessions with composite tracks which combine studio chatter together with the finest moments from various different takes. This disc contains several outtakes which have until now been unavailable anywhere and gives an invaluable insight into the genesis of many well-loved tracks and also into the character and working practice of the Coasters and of their producers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller.     The accompanying 24-page booklet includes many rare photos and an exhaustive session discography by Claus Röhnisch. A collection for Coasters and early rock 'n' roll aficionados!

COL title VAL When the Saints Go Marching In COL performer VAL Fats Domino	COL video title VAL The Beau Brummels\, Play With Fire (Rolling Stones cover) COL description VAL Beau Brummels '66 is the third studio album by American rock group The Beau Brummels\, and their first on Warner Bros. Records. The album consists of twelve cover songs and no originals. Autumn Records\, the band's previous label\, had sold the band to Warner Brothers in early 1966. Warner Brothers\, however\, did not control the publishing rights\, and opted to have the band record an album of covers\, including songs originally performed by Richard Berry\, Rolling Stones\, The Beatles and Bob Dylan\, as well as recent hit singles by such acts as The Mamas & the Papas and Simon & Garfunkel. Lead vocalist Sal Valentino explained\, "When we went to Warner Brothers\, they were just anxious to get a record out\, to capitalize on the success we had. That record was the wrong one to do at the time.  The album features Don Irving on guitar. Irving briefly became a member of the Beau Brummels filling in for Ron Elliott\, who also played on the album\, but was unable to withstand the rigors of touring due to his diabetic condition.

These images are gritty and real. Sometimes history repeats itself\, but hopefully the worst is behind us. Although "Hard Times Come Again No More" sounds as if it were written during the Great Depression\, it was actually written in 1854 by Stephen C. Foster\, America's pioneer songwriter. Mavis Staples\, one of the greatest living gospel and R&B singers\, recorded the song as part of  the CD "Beautiful Dreamer - The Songs of Stephen Foster"  a tribute album released on the Emergent Music label in 2004. Included are many of his famous and some lesser known songs recorded with contemporary interpretations and arrangements.

Feinstein\, accompanied by venerable GRAMMY® Award-winning jazz pianist Alan Broadbent (Charlie Haden\, Diana Krall\, Natalie Cole)\, puts his signature styling on a selection of holiday standards. Now available digitally and in retail stores nationwide\, these sought-after recordings were previously part of a limited release and out of print for over ten years.  No stranger to spreading holiday cheer\, Feinstein’s popular annual holiday concert in New York City is touted by the New York Times to be “as much a Christmas season ritual as catching the Rockettes at Radio City Music Hall or visiting the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree\,” making A Michael Feinstein Christmas a true gem for Feinstein fans as it is the only recorded collection of yuletide songs by the singer.  Long recognized as one of the world’s finest singers and pianists\, Feinstein is also celebrated for his tireless efforts to preserve\, protect and promote the songs and songwriters that shaped the Golden Age of American music. Feinstein founded the Great American Songbook Foundation\, which strives “to bring the music of the Great American Songbook to young people today and to preserve it for future generations.” The foundation is headquartered in Carmel\, Indiana at The Center for the Performing Arts\, where the Midwest-born Feinstein serves as Artistic Director.  Over the course of his non-stop\, 30-plus year career\, Michael Feinstein has wowed millions of fans with his cabaret and concert hall performances\, earned five GRAMMY® nominations\, two EMMY® nods\, and has released nearly an album a year—the majority of which pay tribute to his heroes—Frank Sinatra\, Jimmy Webb\, the Gershwins and  most recently\, André Previn\, with 2013’s Change of Heart: The Songs of André Previn on Concord Records.

COL title VAL Running up That Hill COL performer VAL Sweep & Linda Carriere	COL video title VAL Billy Eckstine -- Stranger in Paradise COL description VAL Billy Eckstine (Pittsburgh\, 8 de julio de 1914 - Pittsburgh\, 8 de marzo de 1993) fue un cantante estadounidense de jazz y música pop. Poseedor de una voz de barítono\, fue durante los años cuarenta una figura carismática de la música popular negra\, al liderar una de las primeras big band de bop y convertirse en el primer cantante negro de baladas románticas (fue llamado el Sinatra negro). Con el paso de los años\, su influencia ha sido considerable en el ámbito del soul y el rhythm and blues.  Eckstine comenzó a cantar a los nueve años y participó en numerosos espectáculos para aficionados. Aunque su vocación había sido la de jugador de fútbol americano\, una grave lesión lo recondujo hacia el mundo de la música. Tras diversos trabajos al oeste de Chicago a finales de los años treinta\, Eckstine fue invitado por Earl Hines para unirse a su Grand Terrace Orchestra en 1939.  Aunque sus primeros éxitos fueron canciones triviales como "Jelly\, Jelly" y "The Jitney Man"\, grabó también varios estándares como "Stormy Monday". Hacia 1943\, se acompañaba de estrellas como Dizzy Gillespie\, Charlie Parker y Sarah Vaughan. Tras formar su propia banda ese año\, contrató a los tres y gradualmente se hizo con más figuras modernas y con futuras estrellas: Wardell Gray\, Dexter Gordon\, Miles Davis\, Kenny Dorham\, Fats Navarro y Art Blakey\, así como con arreglistas como Tadd Dameron y Gil Fuller. La Billy Eckstine Orchestra fue la primera big band bop\, y su líder reflejaba las innovaciones bop adaptando sus armonías vocales a las baladas normales. A pesar del matiz moderno del grupo\, Eckstine encabezó las listas frecuentemente a mediados de los cuarenta\, con temas como "A Cottage for Sale" y "Prisoner of Love". En las giras por Europa y América\, el cantante tocaba también la trompeta\, el trombón de válvulas y la guitarra.  Forzado a disolver la orquesta en 1947 tras haber formado la suya propia Gillespie\, Eckstine realizó una transición hacia un estilo más baladístico y con arreglos de cuerda. Grabó más de una docena de éxitos a finales de los cuarenta\, entre lo que se incluyen "My Foolish Heart" y "I Apologize". Se hizo popular en Gran Bretaña\, obteniendo un gran éxito durante los cincuenta con temas como "No One But You" y "Gigi"\, así como con sus dúos con Sarah Vaughan. Eckstine regresaría a sus raíces jazzísticas ocasionalmente\, grabando con Vaughan\, Count Basie y Quincy Jones\, y grabando un LP en directo\, No Cover\, No Minimum\, en el que interpretaba algunos solos de trompeta. Grabó varios discos para Mercury y Roulette a comienzos de los sesenta y publicó en Motown algunos discos de estándares a mediados de esa década. Tras grabar muy espaciadamente en los setenta\, Eckstine hizo su última grabación (Billy Eckstine Sings with Benny Carter) en 1986. Murió por un ataque al corazón en 1993.

It was written in August and September 1979\, and debuted when the band supported Buzzcocks on their UK tour in September and October 1979. It is one of the few songs in which singer Ian Curtis played guitar (albeit somewhat minimally). The lyrics ostensibly reflect the problems in Ian Curtis's marriage to Deborah Curtis\, as well as his general frame of mind in the time leading up to his suicide in May 1980.  The song was first released in April 1980 and\, after Curtis's suicide that May\, became the band's first chart hit\, reaching number 13 in the UK. It also debuted at #1 in New Zealand in June 1981. The band postponed their US tour after his death\, performed a few short sets as The No-Names\, then finally renamed the group as New Order. "Love" was re-released in 1983 and reached number 19 on the UK charts and re-appeared at #3 in New Zealand during March 1984. In November 1988\, it made one more Top 40 appearance in New Zealand\, peaking at #39. "Love Will Tear Us Apart" appears on the Substance compilation album. It was first recorded for a John Peel session in November 1979\, then re-recorded in January 1980 and March 1980. It is the latter version that appears on Substance. The January 1980 version originally appeared as the single's B-side.  Popularity  "Love Will Tear Us Apart" has remained popular and was listed by NME magazine as the best single of all time in 2002. The song was listed by Rolling Stone magazine at number 179 in its top 500 songs of all time. In May 2007\, NME placed it at number 19 in its list of the 50 Greatest Indie Anthems Ever\, one place ahead of another Joy Division song\, "Transmission". The song reached number 1 in the inaugural Triple J Hottest 100 music poll of 1989 and again in 1990. When being interviewed for New Order Story\, Neil Tennant of the Pet Shop Boys stated that "Love Will Tear Us Apart" was his favourite pop song of all time. He also mentioned several New Order songs in the same dialogue.  Films  The song has also been used in television programs and in films\, such as the 2001 film Donnie Darko\, in a pivotal scene before Donnie has to leave his girlfriend in order to save her. The song is included in the indie film Wristcutters\, which takes place in an afterlife for people who have committed suicide. It was also included in a film about the Manchester music scene\, 24 Hour Party People\, during several scenes about the band and Curtis's suicide. It is heard in the Doctor Who episode "School Reunion". The film Series 7: The Contenders features a music video for the song which characters explain as being part of a school project. Their homemade music video is in the style of a cheaply made '80s video with actors dressed in stereotypical goth fashion. In the sci-fi comedy radio series Undone\, the song is performed as a chime on an ice cream van. On November 11\, 2009 it was featured in the opening scene of episode 7 of season 5 ("The Performer") of the television series Criminal Minds. "Love Will Tear Us Apart" was also featured at the beginning of UK police drama\, Silent Witness in the episode "Voids: Part 1".  Cover versions  "Love Will Tear Us Apart" was eventually performed by New Order (though not for 18 years after Curtis's suicide) and has been covered by many artists including: Thom Yorke\, Mark Owen\, Björk\, Nerina Pallot\, Hawksley Workman\, Calexico\, Bloc Party\, The Cure\, Swans\, Unbroken\, Broken Social Scene\, Nouvelle Vague\, Heavens\, Fall Out Boy\, José González\, Red Mecca\, Yat-Kha\, Stanton Miranda\, U2\, John Frusciante\, Arcade Fire\, REVERE\, Squarepusher\, Honeyroot\, Chris Edwards\, Susanna and the Magical Orchestra\, Moonspell\, The Blood Divine\, Simple Minds\, Oysterband with June Tabor\, Paul Young\, Jamie Cullum\, Evelyn Evelyn and In the Nursery.  The song "Let's Dance to Joy Division" by UK act The Wombats was inspired by "Love Will Tear Us Apart"\, and includes "let love tear us apart" in the lyrics; similarly\, Kasper Bjørke's song "Alcatrez" references "Love Will Tear Us Apart": "Do you think it's true that our love will tear us apart?"  Serbian rock musician\, journalist and writer Dejan Cukić wrote about "Love Will Tear Us Apart" as one of the forty-six songs that changed history of popular music in his 2007 book 45 obrtaja: Priče o pesmama.  Broken Social Scene's cover was featured in the soundtrack for The Time Traveler's Wife . COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	1

COL title VAL How Great Thou Art COL performer VAL John Owen-Jones	COL video title VAL Rosemary Clooney & Perez Prado - You Do Something To Me (VintageMusic.es) COL description VAL Rosemary Clooney\, disfrutó durante la década de los cincuenta de una extraordinaria fama con canciones absolutamente mediocres. De la mano de Mitch Miller\, director artístico de la casa Columbia\, aplicó el inexorable principio de que\, cuantos peores eran los arreglos y las letras de los temas\, mas beneficio económico para la discográfica. onsiguió grabar un par de duets con Frank Sinatra en 1950 y a partir de ahí le sobrevino la fama y la popularidad. Tuvo su propio show televisivo e incluso Hollywood llamó a su puerta para que participara junto a Bing Crosby y Danny Kaye en algunas comedias musicales siendo la mas celebre el film de Michael Curtiz\, "White Christmas".No obstante lo dicho\, Rosemary Clooney\, se acercó tardíamente al jazz y grabó una par de magníficos álbumes para Columbia: "The Best Of Hollywood" con la orquesta del trompetista\, Harry James\, y "Blue Rose"\, su obra mas conseguida y un disco que pudo ser memorable con la orquesta de Duke Ellington. Es la tía sanguínea del actual actor George Clooney.  Dámaso Pérez Prado (Matanzas\, Cuba\, 11 de diciembre de 1916 - Ciudad de México\, 14 de septiembre de 1989)\, el "Rey del Mambo"\, fue un músico\, compositor y arreglista cubano.Dámaso Pérez Prado es mayormente conocido por sus aportes al género del mambo\, que tiene sus orígenes en el danzón cubano y daría pauta al surgimiento y desarrollo del chachachá.Pasado el clímax del mambo\, es llamativo que Dámaso Pérez Prado\, una vez compuesta su pieza musical "Patricia" y obtenido su éxito correspondiente\, la grabase muchas veces y con diferentes arreglos\, actitud que parece demostrar que tuvo por dicha pieza una especial predilección. Entre sus composiciones más conocidas se encuentran Qué rico el mambo y Mambo Nº 5\, ésta última después lanzada en una nueva versión en 1999 por el cantante alemán Lou Bega.

COL title VAL Lei COL performer VAL Charles Aznavour	COL video title VAL Dionne Warwick Do You Know the Way to San Jose 1968 International Smash COL description VAL Dionne Warwick's 1968 million selling Grammy winning international smash hit the Billboard Top 10 in May 1968\, Record World Top 40 at #8 and was also a UK smash at #8. The flip side "Let Me Be Lonely" also written by Bacharach and David also hit the Billboard Hot 100\, one of many double sided hits Dionne recorded on Florence Greenberg's Scepter label. Dionne charted an astonishing eight Billboard Top Twenty hits in less than 30 months: Alfie-#15 July 67; I Say A Little Prayer-Nov 67-#4; Theme From Valley of the Dolls-Feb 68-#2 (4 weeks); Do You Know the Way to San Jose-May 68-#10; Promises\, Promises-Oct 1968-#19; This Girl's In Love With You-March 1969-#7; You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling-#15-Sept 69; I'll Never Fall In Love Again-Jan 70-#6. In addition\, Warwick hit the Top 40 in the same time period with Windows of the World-Sept 67\, Who Is Gonna Love Me-July 68\, and The April Fools-July 69. In 1969 Dionne was the first African-American Female Vocalist to win in the Grammy category Best Contemporary-Pop Vocal Performance\, Female for Do You Know the Way to San Jose. "San Jose" was also used as the theme in Dodge automobile commercials in 1968 and 1969\, for the Charger and the Challenger. "Do You Know the Way to San Jose" became "Dodge Is Turning Up the Fever Now"! Another note of trivia: the background vocalists for this session were Valerie Simpson (Ashford & Simpson)\, Cissy Houston and DeeDee Warwick.  Writes Nick Tosches\, the renowned writer\, music journalist\, novelist\, biographer and poet in the January 7\, 1972 issue of the rock magazine FUSION; ".getting into Dionne Warwick is like finding buried treasure. The Bacharach/David repertoire which milady chooses to sing is so fascinatingly cynical / fatalistic / stoical / emotional / happy\, simultaneously! It's pure emotion. There is a whole lot more to emotion than some rock punk bursting his dexedrine-staved blood vessels by screaming "Baby I need you baby" into a microphone. Dionne Warwick is not a rock and roll singer. She's not a jazz singer either. Rhythm and blues? Nope. A pop singer? No way. Did you ever tongue-kiss with someone who barfed a Singapore Sling bolus into your mouth\, and then four years later you're with someone else and you feel good and you realize how beautiful it all was and then it's all melancholy/happiness\, sort of? That's the kind of singer Dionne Warwick is. She's beautiful. Dionne\, paired with Bacharach's string/horn/reed arrangements\, comes up as a lyric mezzo-sopranoid par-excellence\, melodious/expressiveness-wise. If you've never gotten into her\, you ought to. Get hep to Dionne Warwick. For your own sake." COL channel name VAL dibotis	0

COL title VAL I Want You Back COL performer VAL Shirley Scott	COL video title VAL The Charlie Daniels Band - Back In The Saddle Again.wmv COL description VAL By the Light of the Moon - Campfire Songs (1997) In the 1970s\, fiddler Charlie Daniels was one of the few almost completely country-leaning artists to make a play on the mainstream rock market. He did splendidly for a while\, and the production values he learned playing in rock-inflected settings show clearly on his first kids recording. By the Light of the Moon is most surely a country recording\, but it has all the driving rhythmic energy of an elegantly mastered rock album. The drums sound fat and still crisp\, the guitars bright. Daniels's voice\, especially during the interludes where he speaks about the music\, reveals a timeworn huskiness that will charm kids looking for a cowboy to sing to them. The songs emphasize the old\, with "John Henry" and "I'm an Old Cowhand" standing out. The latter includes Daniels playing short fiddle solos that cut a nice\, fresh path through the tune. A sonically splashy session indeed\, By the Light of the Moon has enough old-timey vibrance to merit a spot in any roots-oriented kids collection.  Song Title    1. Get Along\, Little Dogies 3:26  2.

COL title VAL Santa Baby COL performer VAL Chris Beckstrom	COL video title VAL Sly & The Family Stone - A Family Affair COL description VAL "Family Affair" was a 1971 number-one hit single recorded by Sly & the Family Stone for the Epic Records label.  It became the fourth and final number-one pop hit for the band. Rolling Stone magazine later ranked the song #138 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.  More details (from Wikipedia):  Released on November 6\, 1971\,[1] "Family Affair" was markedly different from the earlier Sly & the Family Stone hits. "Family Affair" is a somber\, Hohner Pianet electric piano based record with a rhythm box (or drum machine) providing the rhythm\, making it the first number-one hit to feature a programmed rhythm track. Sly Stone and his sister Rose  sing lead on the song. The lyrics reflect the good and bad aspects of being family\, with Sly delivering his part in a low funk-styled tone instead of his earlier gospel-based shout.  "Family Affair" was the most successful hit of Sly & the Family Stone's career\, peaking at number-one on the Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks\, while achieving the same on the Billboard R&B Singles chart for five weeks.[2]. The band's long-awaited fifth album\, There's a Riot Goin' On\, debuted at number one on the Billboard album charts during the same period. There's a Riot Goin' On was typified by a deep\, dark style of funk\, evident in "Family Affair"\, that earned the album a place as one of the most influential albums of all time.

COL title VAL Dark End of the Street COL performer VAL Frank Black	COL video title VAL Moonlight In Vermont COL description VAL Those Hoodlum Friends (The Coasters In Stereo) History of RnB Records R002 Powerful two-CD set remastered with loving care featuring outtakes\, stereo versions and album-only tracks.    Available in physical form direct from website http://HistoryofRnB.net   Download from   Amazon http://www.amazon.co.uk/Those-Hoodlum-Friends-Coasters-Stereo/dp/B00BR0QU6A/ref=dm_cd_album_lnk  iTunes https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/those-hoodlum-friends-coasters/id609884465    Stream from Spotify http://open.spotify.com/album/6IDmQkLUjCQe6poBO4izrg   The Coasters had the benefit of recording in the best studios\, backed by the best musicians and produced by the top producers of their generation\, Leiber and Stoller. Naturally\, they were required to run through as many takes of each song as was necessary to satisfy the exacting demands of their mentors. Luckily for us\, many of these alternate takes have survived. Mono was the standard recording format until the late 1960s\, but many of the big selling artists also recorded alternate versions specifically for the stereo market\, which was targeted to the discerning adult listener.     Disc One features all the alternate stereo versions of Coasters songs that were issued at the time on album and subsequently on CD. Disc Two takes you deep into the heart of Coasters sessions with composite tracks which combine studio chatter together with the finest moments from various different takes. This disc contains several outtakes which have until now been unavailable anywhere and gives an invaluable insight into the genesis of many well-loved tracks and also into the character and working practice of the Coasters and of their producers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller.     The accompanying 24-page booklet includes many rare photos and an exhaustive session discography by Claus Röhnisch. A collection for Coasters and early rock 'n' roll aficionados!

COL title VAL That Old Black Magic COL performer VAL Mary Stallings	COL video title VAL Sly & The Family Stone - A Family Affair COL description VAL "Family Affair" was a 1971 number-one hit single recorded by Sly & the Family Stone for the Epic Records label.  It became the fourth and final number-one pop hit for the band. Rolling Stone magazine later ranked the song #138 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.  More details (from Wikipedia):  Released on November 6\, 1971\,[1] "Family Affair" was markedly different from the earlier Sly & the Family Stone hits. "Family Affair" is a somber\, Hohner Pianet electric piano based record with a rhythm box (or drum machine) providing the rhythm\, making it the first number-one hit to feature a programmed rhythm track. Sly Stone and his sister Rose  sing lead on the song. The lyrics reflect the good and bad aspects of being family\, with Sly delivering his part in a low funk-styled tone instead of his earlier gospel-based shout.  "Family Affair" was the most successful hit of Sly & the Family Stone's career\, peaking at number-one on the Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks\, while achieving the same on the Billboard R&B Singles chart for five weeks.[2]. The band's long-awaited fifth album\, There's a Riot Goin' On\, debuted at number one on the Billboard album charts during the same period. There's a Riot Goin' On was typified by a deep\, dark style of funk\, evident in "Family Affair"\, that earned the album a place as one of the most influential albums of all time.

But if you stay I'll make you a day Like no day has been Or will be again We'll sail on your smile We'll ride on your touch We'll talk to the trees that I love so much  But if you go I'll understand Leave me just enough love To fill up my hand  If you go away If you go away If you go away...  If you go away As I know you will You must tell the world To stop turning 'til you return again If you ever do For what good is love Without loving you?

In 1966 Shaw's orchestra performed Themes for Secret Agents.Themes from the James Bond Thrillers Vol.3/More James Bond in Action followed the release of Casino Royale and You Only Live Twice in 1967.

Naturally\, they were required to run through as many takes of each song as was necessary to satisfy the exacting demands of their mentors. Luckily for us\, many of these alternate takes have survived. Mono was the standard recording format until the late 1960s\, but many of the big selling artists also recorded alternate versions specifically for the stereo market\, which was targeted to the discerning adult listener.     Disc One features all the alternate stereo versions of Coasters songs that were issued at the time on album and subsequently on CD. Disc Two takes you deep into the heart of Coasters sessions with composite tracks which combine studio chatter together with the finest moments from various different takes. This disc contains several outtakes which have until now been unavailable anywhere and gives an invaluable insight into the genesis of many well-loved tracks and also into the character and working practice of the Coasters and of their producers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller.     The accompanying 24-page booklet includes many rare photos and an exhaustive session discography by Claus Röhnisch. A collection for Coasters and early rock 'n' roll aficionados!

COL title VAL 'Round Midnight COL performer VAL Linda Ronstadt	COL video title VAL The Charlie Daniels Band - Back In The Saddle Again.wmv COL description VAL By the Light of the Moon - Campfire Songs (1997) In the 1970s\, fiddler Charlie Daniels was one of the few almost completely country-leaning artists to make a play on the mainstream rock market. He did splendidly for a while\, and the production values he learned playing in rock-inflected settings show clearly on his first kids recording. By the Light of the Moon is most surely a country recording\, but it has all the driving rhythmic energy of an elegantly mastered rock album. The drums sound fat and still crisp\, the guitars bright. Daniels's voice\, especially during the interludes where he speaks about the music\, reveals a timeworn huskiness that will charm kids looking for a cowboy to sing to them. The songs emphasize the old\, with "John Henry" and "I'm an Old Cowhand" standing out. The latter includes Daniels playing short fiddle solos that cut a nice\, fresh path through the tune. A sonically splashy session indeed\, By the Light of the Moon has enough old-timey vibrance to merit a spot in any roots-oriented kids collection.  Song Title    1. Get Along\, Little Dogies 3:26  2.

The first concert\, filmed at the Grugahalle in Essen on 19 October 1980\, features a stellar band of Clem Clempson (guitars)\, Billy Cobham (drums) and David Sancious (keyboards)\, a line-up that had come together for the album "I've Always Wanted To Do This" earlier in the year. The set features many songs from that album alongside Cream classics and other Jack Bruce solo tracks. The second concert is a completely solo performance with Jack Bruce at the piano which really emphasizes the quality of his voice and the brilliance of his songwriting. The two shows make a great combination and this a must have DVD for any Jack Bruce fan.

You know - everybody\, no matter who they are  And no matter how different they might be\,  Always runs across the same problem at least once  And that's the problem of love.  And maybe just once in your life\,  You're gonna fall in love with somebody so bad\,  And it's gonna be somebody that don't need you at all  Somebody that's got everything in the world there is to have  And you've got nothing.   I\, I who have nothing  I\, I who have no one  Adore you and love you so  I'm just a no one with nothing to give you but love  I love you   And then you guys\, you're gonna have to tell her something too  So you walk up to that girl and you sing\,   He\, he buys you diamonds  Bright\, sparkling diamonds  But believe me\, hear what I say  He can buy you the world but he'll never love the way  I love you   Listen here\, he can take you any place he wants  To fancy clubs and restaurants  While I can only watch you with  My nose pressed up against the window pane   If then\, just when you think that everything that you already love  Everything that you said has worth and find out that it didn't work at all  Yet when you're all alone you're gonna think about person that you loved so   Bad  Then you're gonna turn out the lights and you're gonna cry all to yourself   I\, I who have nothing  I\, I who have no one  Must watch you go dancing by  Wrapped in the arms of somebody else when darling\, it's I   Who loves you  Who loves you  Who loves you  Who loves you COL channel name VAL grease52	0

COL title VAL Guitar Man COL performer VAL Elvis Presley	COL video title VAL Leslie West - Born To Be Wild.wmv COL description VAL Leslie West - Guitarded (2005) Releasing "all covers" albums can amount to either one of two things. Either the artist doing the covering is buying time between real albums or the artist doing the covering really wants to give some attention back to his musical heroes\, who helped shape his playing early on. Over the years\, former Mountain singer/guitarist Leslie West has recorded quite a few covers\, quite a few of which are featured on a 2005 release (that sported an un-PC title)\, Guitarded. Focusing on old blues numbers and rock tracks from the late '60s\, West proves that he can still let his fingers fly all these years later. Standouts here include a fine\, bluesy take of the Beatles' obscure "Old Brown Shoe\," as well as West covering an old Mountain tune (which late singer/bassist Felix Pappalardi sang originally)\, "Theme for an Imaginary Western." But now for the bad: how many more times can you hear a cover version of the Stones' "Honey Tonk Women" (hasn't every single bar band since the early '70s played this?)\, while an overhaul of Steppenwolf's "Born to Be Wild" (another classic rock tune that certainly doesn't need to be covered for the 50 zillionth time) falls flat. It has its moments\, but overall\, Guitarded will be of interest only to Leslie West fanatics.  Track Listing:  01. Allergic (Jon Tiven/Sally Tiven/Leslie West) - 4'19 02.

Ring Of Fire  ------------------------  "Ring of Fire" or "The Ring of Fire" is a country music song popularized by Johnny Cash and co-written by June Carter (wife of Johnny Cash) and Merle Kilgore. The single appears on Cash's 1963 compilation album\, Ring of Fire: The Best of Johnny Cash. The song was originally recorded by June's sister\, Anita Carter\, on her Mercury Records album Folk Songs Old and New (1963) as "(Love's) Ring of Fire".  When the song failed to become a major hit for Anita\, Cash recorded it his own way\, adding the mariachi-style horns. This sound was later used in the song "It Ain't Me Babe"\, which was recorded around the same time. Mother Maybelle and the Carter sisters are prominently featured in the Cash recording singing harmony. Cash tinkered with a few of the original phrases in Anita Carter's version of the song:  Four years after the song was released\, Carter and Cash were married\, which Cash states helped to stop his alcohol and drug addictions. Cash's daughter Rosanne has stated\, "The song is about the transformative power of love and that's what it has always meant to me and that's what it will always mean to the Cash children.  The song was recorded on March 25\, 1963\, and became the biggest hit of Johnny Cash's career\, staying at number one on the charts for seven weeks.  Legacy  The most commercially successful cover version is by Social Distortion\, who released their punk rock version on the album Social Distortion (1990). The single reached #25 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks\, 27 years after the song was first recorded by Cash. Pop punk band Bowling for Soup would later cover the song on their live album Bowling for Soup: Live and Very Attractive.  The Eric Burdon & the Animals version\, recorded at the end of 1968\, charted in 1969 in the following countries: UK: #35\, GER: #24\, AUS: #10\, AU: #8\, NL: #4; it failed to chart in the US. In late 1974\, the Eric Burdon Band released a heavier version. In 2006\, Burdon performed the song sometimes at his concerts.  A cover of the song was released as a single by Alan Jackson on December 6\, 2010. His rendition of the song also features guest vocals from Lee Ann Womack. It peaked at #45\, becoming his first single to miss the Top 40 since "Blue Blooded Woman" also peaked at #45 in 1990.  Dwight Yoakam also recorded a version of the song\, on his debut album Guitars\, Cadillacs\, Etc.\, Etc.  The song was covered by Frank Zappa in the late 1980s\, and is offered on the 1995 The Best Band You Never Heard in Your Life. release showcasing a short-lived band lineup from a late-1988 tour. Zappa introduces the song by saying he'd met Johnny Cash that afternoon\, and that Johnny was going to come to the show and play with Zappa and his band\, but "his wife got sick." Zappa and the band proceed to play a seriously gonzo reggae version of the song\, with a caricature vocal impersonation of Johnny Cash. A euphemistic take on the song's title (meaning anal/rectal discomfort) permeates the song\, and a number of other numbers throughout the Best Band release. In the early 1980's\, the experimental/new wave band "Wall of Voodoo" (Mexican Radio) recorded a version of "Ring of Fire" that included extended guitar and synthesizer solos. This version of song can be found on the Wall of Voodoo compilation album "Grandma's House\," and can also be heard as background music in the adult film "Night Dreams." This version of the song also includes some slight rearrangement in so much as the repeating background music (layered behind the synth and lead guitar solos at the end of the song\,) borrows very heavily from the repeating incidental music in the "Flint" movies\, ("In Like Flint"\, "Our Man Flint\,") starring James Coburn.  The song is sung at the Molineux by the fans of Wolverhampton Wanderers  Use in media  "Ring of Fire" ranked #4 on CMT's 100 Greatest Songs in Country Music in 2003 and #87 on Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.  The song has also been featured in some video games: the original 1963 song was featured in Tony Hawk's Underground 2\, while a live version recorded in 1987 appeared in Guitar Hero 5 (which features a virtual avatar of Cash). The Social Distortion cover is a downloadable track for the Rock Band series (with the original song also confirmed for download in Rock Band 3) and is featured in Shaun White Snowboarding.  Blondie performed the song in the film Roadie (1980). The live recording was featured on the film soundtrack\, and on a reissue of the Blondie album Eat to the Beat.  It is heard briefly during a scene of the 2006 film Silent Hill. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

Goodnight and joy be with you all.  Oh\, if I had money enough to spend and leisure time to sit awhile There's a fair young man in this town that sorely has my heart beguiled His rosy cheeks and lovely lips\, alone he has my heart in thrall So fill to me the parting glass. Goodnight and joy be with you all.  Of all the comrades that here I've had\, they're sorry for my going away\, And of all the sweethearts that here I had\, they wish me one more day to stay\, But since it falls unto my lot that I should rise and you should not\, I will gently rise and softly call.

COL title VAL Will You Love Me Tomorrow COL performer VAL Millie Jackson	COL video title VAL Francis Alda ~ 1915 ~ Mighty Lak a Rose COL description VAL Fanny Jane Davis was born in New Zealand in 1879.  She achieved fame as much for her colorful personality as for her frequent on stage performances with Caruso at New York's Met.  In her early career she sang in Gilbert & Sullivan productions in Australia in the 1890s and left for Europe at age 22 to study under the direction of Mathilde Marchese in Paris who gave Francis her stage name.  Alda debuted at the Opera Comique in 1904\, appeared at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden in 1906 and performed at Milan's La Scala in 1907-08.  She had a 20 year "peak" in her career from 1910 to 1930 in New York during which time she made 140 recordings for the Victor Talking Machine Commpany.  She died in Venice\, Italy in 1952. Mighty "Lak a Rose was meant to mimic early African American dialect.  One definition of the title is a mother looking at her new born son and comparing him to a beautiful\, strong rose. Before making comments about racism\, please note that this record is in the US Library of Congress as an early example of American song.  Victor 64308 is a single sided 10 inch "red seal" disc recorded in 1915.  Thanks to the descendants of Gustav Groos of San Antonio\, Texas who gave me temporary use of Mr Groos' 1900-1929 record collection to transcribe and show to all persons that might have an interest in early American recordings.

Chloe by Plas Johnson\, a very popular saxophone player\,  from the 1959 Capitol stereo LP titled Mood For The Blues.   Plas John Johnson Jr. (born July 21\, 1931) is an American soul-jazz and hard bop tenor saxophonist\, probably most widely known as the tenor saxophone soloist on Henry Mancini's "The Pink Panther Theme".     Recruited by Capitol Records in the mid-1950s\, Johnson also played on innumerable records by Peggy Lee\, Nat "King" Cole\, Glen Gray\, Frank Sinatra and others. He remained a leading session player for almost twenty years\, averaging two sessions a day and playing everything from movie soundtracks to rock and roll singles\, by such artists as Ricky Nelson and Bobby Vee. He played on many of the Beach Boys' records\, and was an integral part of a number of instrumental groups that existed in name only\, such as B. Bumble and the Stingers. In the late 1950s and early 1960s he was a regular member of Henry Mancini's studio orchestra and in 1963 he recorded the Pink Panther theme. Another solo for a well-known television series was on The Odd Couple's theme music. Johnson was also used by Motown\, and played on hits by Marvin Gaye\, the Supremes and others.  Johnson can be heard on the 1963 album "Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Jerome Kern Songbook"\, recorded under the baton of the great Nelson Riddle. His sax is also heard on two of the other great Ella Fitzgerald songbooks - The Harold Arlen Songbook and The Johnny Mercer Songbook.  In 1964\, Johnson was the featured performer on "Blue Martini" ( Ava Records )\, a concept album by John Neel. It was a groundbreaking album\, with the saxophone being the lead "voice" surrounded by a full string section. This jazz/classical hybrid contains some of Johnson's best and most innovative playing\, with the standout being "Bury Me Blue".  In 1970\, he joined the studio band for "The Merv Griffin Show" and also played with a number of jazz and swing bands of the period. He continues to record and perform\, particularly at jazz festivals.  Johnson currently performs on T990 (brass) and T9937 (solid silver) tenor saxophones made by Yanagisawa. He uses a very open (140/2) Berg Larsen stainless steel mouthpiece with Rico Plasticover no. 2 reeds\, a setup that enables him to produce his very di COL channel name VAL maynardcat	0

I would join a choir\, but I don't think my bathtub can hold that many people.  "  ― Jarod Kintz  "Night Train" has a long and complicated history. The piece's opening riff was first recorded in 1940 by a small group led by Duke Ellington sideman Johnny Hodges under the title "That's the Blues\, Old Man". Ellington used the same riff as the opening and closing theme of a longer-form composition\, "Happy-Go-Lucky Local"\, that was itself one of four parts of his Deep South Suite. Forrest was part of Ellington's band when it performed this composition\, which has a long tenor saxophone break in the middle. After leaving Ellington\, Forrest recorded "Night Train" on United Records and had a major rhythm & blues hit. While "Night Train" employs the same riff as the earlier recordings\, it is used in a much earthier R&B setting. Forrest inserted his own solo over a stop-time rhythm not used in the Ellington composition. He put his own stamp on the tune\, but its relation to the earlier composition is obvious. Like Illinois Jacquet's solo on "Flying Home"\, Forrest's original saxophone solo on "Night Train" became a veritable part of the composition\, and is usually recreated in cover versions by other performers. Buddy Morrow's trombone transcription of Forrest's solo from his big-band recording of the tune is similarly incorporated into many performances. Broadcast Music\, Inc. (BMI) credits the composition to Jimmy Forrest and Oscar Washington. Xavier "Cugie" Cugat adds some ingredients of his own musical style and brings us a "latin" sounding arrangement here that really swings !  Cugat's rhythm section plays an important part in this rendition which makes the song even more danceable. From the 1964 Album "Caricatures" here's Xavier Cugat and His Orchestra with that golden blues & jazz standard : "Night Train".   Enjoy the ride ;) ! COL channel name VAL Socratess2007	0

Feinstein\, accompanied by venerable GRAMMY® Award-winning jazz pianist Alan Broadbent (Charlie Haden\, Diana Krall\, Natalie Cole)\, puts his signature styling on a selection of holiday standards. Now available digitally and in retail stores nationwide\, these sought-after recordings were previously part of a limited release and out of print for over ten years.  No stranger to spreading holiday cheer\, Feinstein’s popular annual holiday concert in New York City is touted by the New York Times to be “as much a Christmas season ritual as catching the Rockettes at Radio City Music Hall or visiting the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree\,” making A Michael Feinstein Christmas a true gem for Feinstein fans as it is the only recorded collection of yuletide songs by the singer.  Long recognized as one of the world’s finest singers and pianists\, Feinstein is also celebrated for his tireless efforts to preserve\, protect and promote the songs and songwriters that shaped the Golden Age of American music. Feinstein founded the Great American Songbook Foundation\, which strives “to bring the music of the Great American Songbook to young people today and to preserve it for future generations.” The foundation is headquartered in Carmel\, Indiana at The Center for the Performing Arts\, where the Midwest-born Feinstein serves as Artistic Director.  Over the course of his non-stop\, 30-plus year career\, Michael Feinstein has wowed millions of fans with his cabaret and concert hall performances\, earned five GRAMMY® nominations\, two EMMY® nods\, and has released nearly an album a year—the majority of which pay tribute to his heroes—Frank Sinatra\, Jimmy Webb\, the Gershwins and  most recently\, André Previn\, with 2013’s Change of Heart: The Songs of André Previn on Concord Records. The prolific performer also hosts a nationally syndicated public radio show\, Song Travels\, and hosted the PBS show Michael Feinstein’s American Songbook. Last summer\, Michael was honored to be named the Principal Pops Conductor at the Pasadena POPS in Southern California\, where he will follow in the footsteps of the great Marvin Hamlisch—certainly a position in which Michael can continue to share his limitless passion for music with the world.

COL title VAL The Prisoner's Song COL performer VAL Vernon Dalhart	COL video title VAL Sarah Vaughan - These Foolish Things COL description VAL The Lonely Hours\, Sarah Vaughan's contribution to the genre of saloon song LPs\, doesn't have a stellar selection of material — although of course nearly anything recorded by one of America's foremost jazz interpreters is worth hearing. Add to that the special treat of Benny Carter — the seminal altoist who'd been contributing charts to the hottest big bands since 1928 — occupying the arranger's chair\, and The Lonely Hours becomes a very intriguing proposition. Carter's refined arrangements and ensemble playing don't exactly reinforce the isolation of the title\, but Vaughan sounds excellent on "I'll Never Be the Same\," "These Foolish Things\," and "If I Had You\," lightly caressing the notes. For "You're Driving Me Crazy" and "What'll I Do\," she cleverly mirrors the comic frustration embodied in Carter's flügelhorn/tuba ensemble. Hopefully\, Carter wasn't responsible for the occasionally canned sound of the strings; The Lonely Hours is a solid match of vocalist and arranger in most respects\, with only the quality of the material weighing it down slightly.

COL title VAL I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate COL performer VAL Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys	COL video title VAL Original Memphis Five - I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate\, 1922 COL description VAL The Original Memphis Five – I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate\,  Fox Trot (Piron)\, Pathé Actuelle 1924 (USA)  NOTE: The Original Memphis Five was an early jazz quintet founded in 1917 by trumpeter Phil Napoleon and pianist Frank Signorelli. Jimmy Lytell was a member from 1922 to 1925 and Miff Mole as standout musicians in the group.  Jimmy Durante played piano (with Ladd's Black Aces) while both Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey were members of the Original Memphis Five. The group made many recordings between 1921 and 1931\, sometimes under different names\, including Ladd's Black Aces (from 1921 until 1924) and The Cotton Pickers. The name Original Memphis Five was first used in 1920\, and applied to various small groups of white musicians throughout the decade. Both Red Nichols and Miff Mole later led their own groups named Original Memphis Five. Phil Napoleon\, however\, would continue using the group name until 1990.   In the first two decades of the 20th century\, the social dance was passing through enormous transformations both in its form and spiritual content. From the waltz or a tango - which were the intimate au pair experience - it was developing towards a hot collective\, almost tribal dance imported from Africa and the Caribbean. "Coarse"\, "boorish"\, "vulgar" - those are only some from vast collection of insults the new dances were determined by the journals. Machicha\, shimmy - these were the first swallows of the dancefloor entertainment. Yet\, it wasn't until 1925 - when came King Charleston and took power - and the world learned what it might be a collective dance madness.   Shimmy - which in 1919 was launched exaequo by two Broadway stars: Gilda Gray and Bee Palmer - was an earlier version of the Charleston\, more elaborate with the elements of oriental dance. The name "shimmy" comes from one of the figures of Arabic belly dancing. Gilda Gray however - who was Polish (Marianna Michalska born in Cracow\, Poland) - supported the rumors - supposedly for self-promotional purposes - that name "shimmy" comes from her imperfect English\, when preparing to go on stage Gilda spoke to her dresser: - Gimmie dat' sheemiee' (chemise). For these and other reasons\, the slideshow in this film presents a small collection of lovely covers of the shimmy-sheet music from various places in the world.  For those who want to see\, how DID REALLY look the shimmy-dance\, go and see two fantastic shimmy-renditions by the Budapest Operetta artrists\, from 2012 and 2010 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBp8yqpSOgA  and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExjcIaAAMug and also a very good Russian version from 2010 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp1Hzm803q0 . All are danced to Emmerich Kalman's famous shimmy "Fräulein\, woll'n Sie Shimmy tanzen?" from operette "Bayadera". COL channel name VAL 240252	1

COL title VAL I'll Drown in My Tears COL performer VAL Sonny Thompson - Vocal by Lula Reed	COL video title VAL DAVID RUFFIN -"(IF LOVING YOU IS WRONG) I DON'T WANT TO BE RIGHT" (1973) COL description VAL David Ruffin's third and self-titled solo offering was in many ways a collaborative effort with Bobby Miller\, who produced the David Ruffin (1973) album and supplied eight of its ten tracks. There is a conspicuous dichotomy between the personas that Ruffin portrays throughout the project and the man whose fractious relationship with Motown had practically cost him his association with the label. Things had gotten so bad\, they permanently shelved what should have been Ruffin's third LP. Motown simply refused to put it out until cooler heads eventually prevailed some three decades later. He was likewise no longer afforded access to "A-list" material and support musicians either. While his previous outings had sold respectably\, they certainly were no match for the likes of Stevie Wonder\, Marvin Gaye\, or even his former bandmates in the Temptations whose "Papa Was a Rollin' Stone" had been a crossover pop chart topper months earlier. "The Rovin' Kind" gets things underway bearing an almost emblematic mid-tempo Motown groove. Ruffin's once crystalline voice now endures the sonic substantiation of chronic drug and alcohol addiction. In a perverse way\, the combination of his aging falsetto\, coupled with the rough-hewn timbre\, actually enhance his role in the ballad "Common Man\," as well as the blithe and bouncy "I'm Just a Mortal Man" with the Andantes providing the equally amicable background vocals. The update of "(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want to Be Right" -- a seductive side that Luther Ingram had considerable success with the previous year -- is personalized as Ruffin confides in the opening that he is "a man in desperation" backing it up with the plea "can't you help the situation"? His short rhythmically spoken intro continues as he owns up to his reputation as a "wild child\," begging the question whether Ruffin is actually in or out of character. The Philly-style soul of the Kenny Gamble/Leon Huff written "I Miss You" suits the heart-wrenching adaptation. The six-plus minute gritty social commentary "Blood Donors Needed (Give All You Can)" is a starkly accurate portrayal of inner-city life. Perhaps in the escapism mentality of the times\, it failed to make an impact on the singles charts. Yet\, the lack of a marketable 45 seems to have had little relevance on R&B record buyers as David Ruffin made it into the Top Five album survey -- although it did not fare nearly as well\, peaking at number 168 on the pop side. Those slipping figures are endemic indicators of the increasing lack of interest that Motown would invest in Ruffin's future endeavors. COL channel name VAL MANNY MORA	0

COL title VAL O sole mio COL performer VAL Franco Pagani	COL video title VAL Aretha Franklin - Laughing on the Outside (Crying on the Inside) Columbia Records 1963 COL description VAL "Laughing on the Outside (Crying on the Inside)" is a popular song written by Bernie Wayne\, the lyrics by Ben Raleigh. The song was published in 1946.  Aretha Sings the Blues is a 1980 compilation of previously released Aretha Franklin recordings from Aretha's early 1960s tenure with Columbia Records.  Aretha Louise Franklin (March 25\, 1942 – August 16\, 2018) was an American singer and songwriter. Franklin began her career as a child singing gospel at New Bethel Baptist Church in Detroit\, where her father\, C. L. Franklin\, was minister. In 1960\, at the age of 18\, she embarked on a secular career\, recording for Columbia Records but only achieving modest success. Following her signing to Atlantic Records in 1967\, Franklin achieved commercial acclaim and success with songs such as "Respect"\, "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman"\, "Spanish Harlem" and "Think". By the end of the 1960s she had gained the title "The Queen of Soul".   Franklin eventually recorded a total of 112 charted singles on Billboard\, including 77 Hot 100 entries\, 17 top ten pop singles\, 100 R&B entries and 20 number-one R&B singles\, becoming the most charted female artist in the chart's history.   Franklin also recorded acclaimed albums such as I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You\, Lady Soul\, Young\, Gifted and Black and Amazing Grace before experiencing problems with her record company by the mid-1970s. After her father was shot in 1979\, Franklin left Atlantic and signed with Arista Records\, finding success with her part in the 1980 film The Blues Brothers and with the albums Jump to It (1982) and Who's Zoomin' Who? (1985).   In 1998\, Franklin won international acclaim for singing the opera aria "Nessun dorma"\, at the Grammys of that year replacing Luciano Pavarotti. Later that same year\, she scored her final Top 40 recording with "A Rose Is Still a Rose".   Franklin's other popular and well known hits include "Rock Steady"\, "Jump to It"\, "Freeway of Love"\, "Who's Zoomin' Who"\, "Chain Of Fools"\, "Until You Come Back to Me (That's What I'm Gonna Do)"\, "Something He Can Feel"\, "I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)" (with George Michael)\, and a remake of The Rolling Stones song "Jumpin' Jack Flash".   Franklin has won a total of 18 Grammy Awards and is one of the best-selling musical artists of all time\, having sold over 75 million records worldwide.  Franklin has been honored throughout her career including a 1987 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\, in which she became the first female performer to be inducted. She was inducted to the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. In August 2012\, Franklin was inducted into the GMA Gospel Music Hall of Fame.  Franklin is listed in at least two all-time lists on Rolling Stone magazine\, including the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time\, and the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time.  On August 13\, 2018\, Franklin was reported to be gravely ill at her home near Detroit. She was reported to be under hospice care and surrounded by friends and family. Stevie Wonder and Jesse Jackson\, among others\, had visited her. Franklin died at home in Detroit on August 16\, aged 76. The cause was reported to be advanced pancreatic cancer.  The crowd sees me out dancing Carefree and romancing Oh\, I'm happy with my someone new  I'm laughing on the outside Crying on the inside 'Cause I'm still in love with you  They see me night and daytime Oh\, I'm having such a gay time But they don't know what I go through  I'm laughing on the outside Crying on the inside 'Cause I'm still in love with you  No one knows\, it's just a pose Pretending I'm glad we're apart And when I cry\, my eyes are dry Oh\, the tears are in my heart  So darling\, can't we make up? Ever\, ever since our breakup Make believe is all I do  I'm laughing on the outside Crying on the inside 'Cause I'm still in love with you  I'm still laughing on the outside But everyday I'm crying on the inside Because I'm still\, still in love with you COL channel name VAL RoundMidnightTV	0

COL title VAL Get Back COL performer VAL Frank Chacksfield and His Orchestra	COL video title VAL Billy Vaughn and His Orchestra - Raunchy (1957) COL description VAL Charted at #10 on Billboard Hot 100 in December 1957. This instrumental also charted at #2 on the Hot 100 for Bill Justis (#6 Country\, #1 R&B\, #11 UK) and #4 on the Hot 100 for Ernie Freeman (#11 Country\, #1 R&B). It also charted #19 in the UK for the Ken Mackintosh Orchestra in February 1958 and #118 under the Hot 100 in the US for Bill Black's Combo in June 1964.  Original Billboard review: "A strong version of the interesting blues tune that's already blossoming with sides by Bill Justis and Ernie Freeman. This can share in the loot but the flip side could be the bigger one for Vaughn." Billboard rating: 80 out of 100.   Written by Bill Justis & Sid Manker.   The other side of this single is "Sail Along Silvery Moon" which charted at #5. COL channel name VAL CatsPjamas1	0

COL title VAL Mercedes Benz COL performer VAL Mitsou	COL video title VAL The Charlie Daniels Band - Back In The Saddle Again.wmv COL description VAL By the Light of the Moon - Campfire Songs (1997) In the 1970s\, fiddler Charlie Daniels was one of the few almost completely country-leaning artists to make a play on the mainstream rock market. He did splendidly for a while\, and the production values he learned playing in rock-inflected settings show clearly on his first kids recording. By the Light of the Moon is most surely a country recording\, but it has all the driving rhythmic energy of an elegantly mastered rock album. The drums sound fat and still crisp\, the guitars bright. Daniels's voice\, especially during the interludes where he speaks about the music\, reveals a timeworn huskiness that will charm kids looking for a cowboy to sing to them. The songs emphasize the old\, with "John Henry" and "I'm an Old Cowhand" standing out. The latter includes Daniels playing short fiddle solos that cut a nice\, fresh path through the tune. A sonically splashy session indeed\, By the Light of the Moon has enough old-timey vibrance to merit a spot in any roots-oriented kids collection.  Song Title    1. Get Along\, Little Dogies 3:26  2. Cowboy Logic 4:33  3. I'm an Old Cowhand (from the Rio Grande) 3:32  4. Old Chisholm Trail 4:47  5. Sixteen Tons 2:58  6. Back in the Saddle Again 3:11  7. John Henry 3:56  8. Top Hand 4:04  9.

Arranged by James E. Bond\, Jr. Produced by Nick Venet.  Joanie\, who scored a #7 US hit with “Johnny Get Angry” in the summer of 1962\, didn’t return to Hot-100 after “When The Boys Get Together” charted in October of the same year.  Some great records followed on Warners\, however\, including the northern soul favorite\, “Don’t Pity Me” in 1965. By 1967\, Joanie was with Columbia\, where she released a number of Bacharach-David on 45; “Alfie”\, “It Doesn’t Matter Anymore” and “Take A Broken Heart”.   The following year\, Joanie had moved to Capitol but still retained an affinity for Bacharach-David songs by releasing “Trains And Boats And Planes”.  Other great versions of this Bacharach-David classic: Billy J Kramer & The Dakotas (1965\, US #47) and Dionne Warwick (1966\, US #22). COL channel name VAL 45rpmMike	0

COL title VAL Dear Prudence COL performer VAL Phish	COL video title VAL Staccatos - You ain't going nowhere COL description VAL The Staccatos are a South African band formed in November 1961 by Brian Le Gassick. The original line-up consisted of Brian Le Gassick – lead vocals\, guitar\, John Leach – lead guitar\, Willie van der Walt – bass and Ian Miller – drums. In 1962 Leach and van der Walt were replaced by Richard Crouse – guitar\, Jimmy Routledge – bass and Billy Andrews – vocals\, harmonica (Billy later became one half of the duo the “Dream Merchants” with Billy Forrest). In 1964 the Staccatos won the Transvaal Merseyside Contest\, which included a recording contract with EMI. They supported Peter and Gordon on their tour of South Africa in 1965.  In 1966 Steve Lonsdale took over the lead vocals\, and Richard Crouse married Wanda Arletti who joined the group for a tour of Zambia. In 1967 Eddie Boyle – bass\, and Ronnie Cline – organ\, joined the group. In 1968 Billy Forrest approached the group to record “Cry to me” for the film “Katrina”. This song became their biggest hit\, reaching number 1 on the South African Top 20 in 1969 and charting for a massive 38 weeks\, earning them a double gold disc.  In 1969 John Elliot – sax\, joined the group and in 1970 Ivor Black – drums and Peter Vee – lead vocals (Steve Lonsdale left for America).  This song is off the album “Hear And Now” released in 1968. It was written by Bob Dylan in 1967\, but only released in September 1971 on the album "Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Vol II". COL channel name VAL keurspel (Leon Rossouw)	0

A year of steady touring through the US and Europe has allowed the group to create a seamless set\, mixing songs from their critically-acclaimed debut studio album\, I’m Still Here\, with a couple covers of classic soul songs from their native Minneapolis\,  and re-imagined bits from Led Zeppelin and James Brown. Recorded in their hometown of Minneapolis at the Dakota Jazz Club over two nights and four performances\, Sonny Knight and the Lakers aim to bring a new focus on the art of the live record. Hoping to add to the rich history of live albums rather than producing something merely derivative\, they set out to reconstruct the ephemeral experience of a live concert and earn a permanent place on your record shelf".

Jimmy Lytell was a member from 1922 to 1925 and Miff Mole as standout musicians in the group.  Jimmy Durante played piano (with Ladd's Black Aces) while both Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey were members of the Original Memphis Five. The group made many recordings between 1921 and 1931\, sometimes under different names\, including Ladd's Black Aces (from 1921 until 1924) and The Cotton Pickers. The name Original Memphis Five was first used in 1920\, and applied to various small groups of white musicians throughout the decade. Both Red Nichols and Miff Mole later led their own groups named Original Memphis Five. Phil Napoleon\, however\, would continue using the group name until 1990.   In the first two decades of the 20th century\, the social dance was passing through enormous transformations both in its form and spiritual content. From the waltz or a tango - which were the intimate au pair experience - it was developing towards a hot collective\, almost tribal dance imported from Africa and the Caribbean. "Coarse"\, "boorish"\, "vulgar" - those are only some from vast collection of insults the new dances were determined by the journals. Machicha\, shimmy - these were the first swallows of the dancefloor entertainment. Yet\, it wasn't until 1925 - when came King Charleston and took power - and the world learned what it might be a collective dance madness.   Shimmy - which in 1919 was launched exaequo by two Broadway stars: Gilda Gray and Bee Palmer - was an earlier version of the Charleston\, more elaborate with the elements of oriental dance. The name "shimmy" comes from one of the figures of Arabic belly dancing. Gilda Gray however - who was Polish (Marianna Michalska born in Cracow\, Poland) - supported the rumors - supposedly for self-promotional purposes - that name "shimmy" comes from her imperfect English\, when preparing to go on stage Gilda spoke to her dresser: - Gimmie dat' sheemiee' (chemise). For these and other reasons\, the slideshow in this film presents a small collection of lovely covers of the shimmy-sheet music from various places in the world.  For those who want to see\, how DID REALLY look the shimmy-dance\, go and see two fantastic shimmy-renditions by the Budapest Operetta artrists\, from 2012 and 2010 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBp8yqpSOgA  and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExjcIaAAMug and also a very good Russian version from 2010 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp1Hzm803q0 .

The first concert\, filmed at the Grugahalle in Essen on 19 October 1980\, features a stellar band of Clem Clempson (guitars)\, Billy Cobham (drums) and David Sancious (keyboards)\, a line-up that had come together for the album "I've Always Wanted To Do This" earlier in the year. The set features many songs from that album alongside Cream classics and other Jack Bruce solo tracks. The second concert is a completely solo performance with Jack Bruce at the piano which really emphasizes the quality of his voice and the brilliance of his songwriting. The two shows make a great combination and this a must have DVD for any Jack Bruce fan.

Jessie Belvin "Goodnight My Love" 1956  This is a Mint- Copy of this great all-time classic\, please enjoy!  The all-time classic "Mr. Easy" Jessie Belvin   While not nearly as well remembered by the general public as either Sam Cooke or Otis Redding\, singer Jesse Belvin was in many regards a performer of equal stature whose career was also cut far too short by tragedy. At the time of his death\, Belvin was moving in the much the same direction as Cooke (he was even on the same record label\, although signed earlier)\, and was scoring and writing hits long before Redding ever cut a record. Jesse Lorenzo Belvin was born in San Antonio\, TX\, in 1932. When he was five\, his family relocated to Los Angeles\, and by age seven he was singing in church. He discovered R&B in his early teens\, and in 1950 joined jazz saxophonist Big Jay McNeely's backing vocal quartet Three Dots and a Dash. Belvin's falsetto was placed up front in his debut release\, 1950's "All the Wine Is Gone"; the response was so strong that on the group's next record\, his name was placed directly under McNeely's on the B-side\, "Sad Story." In 1952\, Belvin and bandmate Marvin Phillips signed to Specialty. They cut four singles: the first three — "Baby Don't Go\," "One Little Blessing\," and "Love of My Life" — were credited to Jesse Belvin\, and all failed to chart. The last\, "Dream Girl\," which featured Belvin on piano and vocals with Phillips on saxophone\, was credited to Jesse & Marvin\, and got to number two on the R&B charts in 1953.   It was with Modern that he cut his most enduring record. "Goodnight My Love" had been written by producer George Mottola ten years earlier\, but he had never been able to finish it; Belvin provided the lines for the bridge that completed the song\, but asked for 400 dollars in lieu of co-authorship credit. Mottola didn't have it\, but a colleague\, John Marascalco\, did\, and put up the money\, receiving co-authorship credit in the bargain.  The song reached number seven on the R&B charts in 1956; curiously\, the pianist on the recording was an 11-year-old session player making his recording debut named BARRY WHITE\, who would emerge as a giant in his own right about two decades later. More important at the time\, "Goodnight My Love" became the outro theme to Alan Freed's rock & roll radio show\, heard by millions of young listeners every night. Belvin cut ten singles for Modern\, of which "Goodnight My Love" was far and away the most successful. In 1958\, he was again on the move\, recording for Knight\, Class\, and Jamie Records under his own name\, as well as for the Aladdin label in association with the Sharptones.  His biggest success that year\, however\, came through a group called the Shields\, which had been formed by George Mottola to record on his own Tender label. Adding his voice to the mix\, Belvin joined the group\, which also included Frankie Ervin on lead\, Johnny "Guitar" Watson on bass\, baritone Tommy "Buster" Williams\, "Handsome" Mel Williams on second tenor\, Ernie Freeman on piano\, Irving Ashby on bass\, Rene Hall guitar\, and Davis Williams drums. The Shields' only record with Belvin was "You Cheated\," which had already been cut by a white group called the Slades; the Shields' version was the more successful\, reaching number 15 on the pop charts in the summer of 1958.  In late 1959\, with the encouragement of his wife and the support of producer Dick Pierce and arranger/conductor Marty Paich\, Belvin went into the studio for three recording dates that yielded a dozen songs\, among them intensely soulful covers of standards like "Blues in the Night\," "In the Still of the Night\," and "Makin' Whoopee." The band included Art Pepper on the sax and clarinet and Jack Sheldon on the trumpet\, and the playing was extraordinary all the way around.  Alas\, Belvin never heard the finished album\, Mr. Easy; on February 6\, 1960\, shortly after finishing a performance in Little Rock\, AR\, on a bill with Sam Cooke\, Jackie Wilson\, and Marv Johnson\, Belvin and his wife were killed in a head-on auto collision. Mr. Easy was released later in 1960\, his final testament and an enduring legacy.  This Is such a sad\, sad thing. God Bless you Jessie Belvin\, your life ended too soon\, but your soul & your music will still live on\, as long as we keep listening. R.I.P.

L'auteur de L'écume des jours a su trouver les mots qui sonnent avec grâce. La direction musicale de Laurent De Wild est un "Voyage au Paradis".  Libération -- 2009 -- Bruno Pfeiffer -- Diane chante Vian tel que -- Un météore a explosé la surface tranquille de la lune : son dernier disque "Docteur Boris et Mister Vian". Le travail enduit de baume les oreilles\, puis le reste de la carcasse. C'est tout simplement extra... Un régal. Vian n'aurait sans doute pas hésité à applaudir « Rue de la flemme ». Quel concentré de swing relâché! Quel modèle de grande chanson (tour de force de la traduction)! Pourquoi  citer seulement  le savoureux « Voyage au Paradis » ? Les onze valent le coup. Le disque passe comme un remède à l'imbécillité de la période actuelle... La profondeur légère de l'interprétation s'offre comme un cadeau. Les chorus de Laurent de Wilde\, huit ou seize mesures maxi\, ne goinfrent pas la mise en place. La complicité de l'ensemble se ressent du respect flagrant que se portent les artistes. Le prochain qui me classe Diane Tell dans la variété\, je l'enjoins : jazzons les idées préconçues.

COL title VAL Let's Get Together COL performer VAL The Carolyn Hester Coalition	COL video title VAL BUZZY LINHART - Let's Get Together (1971) COL description VAL From the 1971 album THE TIME TO LIVE IS NOW. Buzzy Linhart's first of two albums for Kama Sutra\, three if you include the band Music's on the Buddah-distributed Eleuthera Records\, 1971's The Time to Live Is Now has the songwriter playing with different styles and sounds in a setting that is not as refined as the Eddie Kramer co-produced Music album or Barry Beckett and Roger Hawkins' production of 1974's Pussycats Can Go Far. But don't blame the artist for that. In an exclusive interview for the All Media Guide conducted February 28th\, 2002\, Linhart revealed some of the secrets of The Time To Live Is Now: Bill Takas and Luther Rix\, the bass player and drummer\, are "world class jazz and classical musicians." Bill Takas spent nine years on the Tonight Show\, and they co-founded Ten Wheel Drive (with Genya Ravan; see the Construction #1 LP). "We had been performing eight-to-ten months as a trio\, sometimes with sax...it was supposed to be more [produced] like 'Pussycats' (Pussycats Can Go Far)...but [record exec] Neil Bogart played this for a group of 30-something pros for Buddah/Kama Sutra\, and they got up out of their chairs and danced to it." That resulted in the late Neil Bogart deciding he wanted to release the roughs -- the rough vocals\, the rough mix\, even with a 32\,000 dollar budget\, which was pretty good at that point in time. They called this "rock-folk\," rock with a jazz tinge as opposed to "jazz rock" that was Blood\, Sweat & Tears. Even in its raw form\, it is great stuff. Linhart lifts lines from here and there. Four lines from the Beatles' 1968 hit "Lady Madonna" are taken almost verbatim in the title track -- "Who buys the money\, when you pay the rent" -- while the strange "Cheat Cheat Lied" is fused with Percy Mayfield's "Hit the Road Jack\," Linhart lifting a melody and line from Blind Faith's "Presence of the Lord." On the following album\, Buzzy (also called "The Black Album" as his 1969 outing on Phillips was also titled Buzzy)\, he's more blatantly lifting "What the World Needs Now Is Love" for his "Rollin' On" title. When he goes into Chester Powers' 1963 composition "Let's Get Together\," you think he's absconding with lyrics and melody again\, but it's actually a very cool cover of the Youngbloods' "Get Together\," which hit for them in 1967 and 1969. It is charming\, as is the first appearance of "Friends\," the Barry Manilow-produced hit for Bette Midler in 1973\, re-cut by Buzzy on Pussycats Can Go Far and the only appearance here of friend Moogy Klingman\, in the capacity of co-writer. Most of the material is by Linhart\, "Good Face" being co-written with future Music bandmemberDoug Rodrigues\, while drummer and co-producer Luther Rix pens and sings "Comin' Home." The group covers Jordan Kaplan's "There's No Need" with the legendary Ken Ascher on piano\, and Jeannie Linhart does a vocal harmony on "The Love's Still Growing\," but other than that\, it's the three-piece unit producing and performing on this Kama Sutra debut album. Todd Rundgren would come onboard to mix "The Black Album\," 1972's Buzzy\, which would replace Takas with Danny Trifan on bass\, and add Jeff "Skunk" Baxter on guitar\, but The Time to Live Is Now remains an important\, albeit raw\, document of a major talent emerging from the early '70s.  -Allmusic COL channel name VAL plusgloss	1

She said that's that. I don't wanna chitter-chat. Turn it down a little bit or turn it down flat.  Pump it up when you don't really need it. Pump it up until you can feel it.  Down in the pleasure centre\, hell bent or heaven sent\, listen to the propaganda\, listen to the latest slander. There's nothing underhand that she wouldn't understand.  Pump it up until you can feel it. Pump it up when you don't really need it.  She's been a bad girl. She's like a chemical. Though you try to stop it\, she's like a narcotic. You wanna torture her. You wanna talk to her. All the things you bought for her\, putting up your temp'rature.  Pump it up until you can feel it. Pump it up when you don't really need it.  Out in the fashion show\, down in the bargain bin\, you put your passion out under the pressure pin. Fall into submission\, hit-and-run transmission. No use wishing now for any other sin.

Pubblicata nel 1938\, la canzone fu inserita nel musical di Broadway "This Way" \,in cui venne  eseguita dal cantante Tamara Drasin\, che aveva qualche anno prima cantato "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes". Il brano è uno standard jazz\, ed è statoinciso da numerosi artisti nel corso degli anni. Il tema musicale ha potere emotivo\, ed è stato molto amato durante la seconda guerra mondiale\, quando divenne un inno per coloro che prestavano servizio all'estero (dai soldati britannici e  americani). La versione più ricordata è quella di Billie Holiday (1944) e altrettanto nota è quella di Bing Crosby dello stesso anno\, dal film omonimo con  Ginger Rogers and Joseph Cotten. Mina la propone nel suo album "12 American Songbook" del 2012.

It was released on 1 July 1977 as the third single and was later featured on their only album\, Never Mind the Bollocks\, Here's the Sex Pistols\, released that same year. The song marked the band's (then) only appearance on the British music show Top of the Pops\, until 1996 when the original line-up performed the song (after the live version was released that year) as well as "New York" on the same showing. The song is infamous for vocalist John Lydon's phrasing of the word "vacant"\, emphasising the last syllable making it sound like the vulgar word "cunt". According to Glen Matlock the riff was inspired by "S.O.S." by ABBA after hearing it on the radio. The B-side is a cover of The Stooges' "No Fun" which they played on the spot without a proper rehearsal. No Fun was taken from demo sessions recorded by producer Dave Goodman.  The band made a video of Pretty Vacant for Top Of The Pops (as well as God Save The Queen) on 11 & 12 July 1977 at the studios of ITN in Wells St\, London. They were thrown out after throwing cans of lager at the cameramen on the 11th but came back on the 12th to finish the recording.  NME magazine made it their Single of the Year in 1977. In March 2005\, Q magazine placed the song at number 26 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks.  The album was reissued as a 2CD set in 1992. A live version of the track from Filthy Lucre Live was released as a single in 1996\, and a 7" picture disc was released in 2012.  Covers and samples  Joey Ramone used the lead riff in his cover of "What a Wonderful World".  South African pop group Shikisha released a cover version of the song in 1996.  The French band Les Négresses Vertes as well as grime MC Lady Sovereign have both covered "Pretty Vacant" and performed live versions of the song. Lady Sovereign's version is featured in the popular TV show\, The O.C. and the cover version is featured on one of the six The O.C. soundtracks called Music from The O.C.: Mix 6 -- Covering Our Tracks.  Joan Jett released a cover version on single.  In 1996 Black Grape released cover version (very similiar to an original) on their single "Fat Neck".  An Irish language version of the song\, entitled "Folamh go Deas" (a literal translation)\, was performed by Irish band Na Magairlí in 1981.  The group The Ukrainians perform a Ukrainian language version of this song on their EP Anarchy In The UK and album Respublika. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

Included in the album ‘Bringing It All Back Home’. The Byrds recorded a version of the song and they released it that same year reaching #1 on both the US and the UK singles charts. The Byrds version was so influential that is recognized that it initiated the folk-rock sub-genre. Since the 60’s\, multiple artists including Stevie Wonder\, Judy Collins\, William Shatner and even Bob Sinclar have covered the song. The song appears twice on Rolling Stone’s list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All time. Bob Dylan’s version at #107 and The Byrds’ at #79. 80s RE:COVERED is an ambitious project that brings back to the studio\, the artists and producers who masterminded the most iconic hits of the decade\, this time to record a classic song from any other era\, produced in an 80’s style\, carefully chosen by the artist for this album. Every track is an exclusive and previously unreleased cover version!  • Kim Carnes\, passionately delivers the classic Rolling Stones number ”Under My thumb”. • Heaven 17 takes a unique spin on Elton John “Rocket Man” • ABC delivers the most touching rendition on Radiohead “High and Dry” • Wang Chung drives on to an angular version of Blur “Girls And Boys”. • Kim Wilde brilliant version of “Love Will Keep Us Together “ from Captain & Tennille  will definitely bring the 80's rushing back to you. • Belinda Carlisle\, emotionally delivers in her unique style\, a splendid cover of Credence “Have you ever seen the rain”. • Johnny Hates Jazz takes Mr. Tambourine Man from Bob Dylan on a dreamlike outing. • Samantha Fox shows an amazing vocal interpretation of Donna Summer “Hot Stuff”. • Black delivers a poignant and wonderful rendition on Chris Isaak “Wicked Game”. • China Crisis vocal melodies shine on the evergreen Carole King “It's Too Late”.   • Curiosity Killed The Cat adds their unique emotional warmth to the Doobie Brothers classic “Long Train Runnin'” • Go West delivers a great upbeat danceable version of Killers classic “Human”   Need we say more?

COL title VAL Some Other Time COL performer VAL Cassandra Wilson	COL video title VAL Xavier Cugat and His Orchestra -  Night Train COL description VAL " I only sing in the shower. I would join a choir\, but I don't think my bathtub can hold that many people.  "  ― Jarod Kintz  "Night Train" has a long and complicated history. The piece's opening riff was first recorded in 1940 by a small group led by Duke Ellington sideman Johnny Hodges under the title "That's the Blues\, Old Man". Ellington used the same riff as the opening and closing theme of a longer-form composition\, "Happy-Go-Lucky Local"\, that was itself one of four parts of his Deep South Suite. Forrest was part of Ellington's band when it performed this composition\, which has a long tenor saxophone break in the middle. After leaving Ellington\, Forrest recorded "Night Train" on United Records and had a major rhythm & blues hit. While "Night Train" employs the same riff as the earlier recordings\, it is used in a much earthier R&B setting. Forrest inserted his own solo over a stop-time rhythm not used in the Ellington composition. He put his own stamp on the tune\, but its relation to the earlier composition is obvious. Like Illinois Jacquet's solo on "Flying Home"\, Forrest's original saxophone solo on "Night Train" became a veritable part of the composition\, and is usually recreated in cover versions by other performers. Buddy Morrow's trombone transcription of Forrest's solo from his big-band recording of the tune is similarly incorporated into many performances. Broadcast Music\, Inc. (BMI) credits the composition to Jimmy Forrest and Oscar Washington. Xavier "Cugie" Cugat adds some ingredients of his own musical style and brings us a "latin" sounding arrangement here that really swings !  Cugat's rhythm section plays an important part in this rendition which makes the song even more danceable. From the 1964 Album "Caricatures" here's Xavier Cugat and His Orchestra with that golden blues & jazz standard : "Night Train".   Enjoy the ride ;) ! COL channel name VAL Socratess2007	0

Goodnight and joy be with you all.  Oh\, if I had money enough to spend and leisure time to sit awhile There's a fair young man in this town that sorely has my heart beguiled His rosy cheeks and lovely lips\, alone he has my heart in thrall So fill to me the parting glass. Goodnight and joy be with you all.  Of all the comrades that here I've had\, they're sorry for my going away\, And of all the sweethearts that here I had\, they wish me one more day to stay\, But since it falls unto my lot that I should rise and you should not\, I will gently rise and softly call. Goodnight and joy be with you all. COL channel name VAL 92mystique	0

She was signed to a long-term contract with the soft-drink company to sing all television and radio commercials\, do all magazine and billboard advertising representing them in every capacity\, sometimes sharing the spotlight with American Bandstand's Dick Clark.

Later\, she became the regular female vocalist on the popular 60's American live rock n roll TV show "Shindig" and she appeared in singing and acting roles in many iconic TV shows like Batman\, The Monkees\, Gomer Pyle\, The Mothers-In-Law\, Red Skelton\, Milton Berle and various game shows.

It was also ranked #320 on the Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.  Although Hawkins' version did not make any charts\, several later cover versions have done so. Nina Simone's version reached # 23 in the US Billboard R&B chart in 1965; it also reached # 49 in the UK singles chart that year\, and # 28 when it was reissued in 1969. The version by The Alan Price Set reached # 9 in the UK in 1966\, and # 80 on the Billboard Hot 100. Creedence Clearwater Revival's version reached # 58 on the US Hot 100 in 1968. In the UK\, Bryan Ferry's version reached # 18 in 1993\, and the version by Sonique reached # 36 in 1998 and # 5 on reissue in 2000. The song has been recorded by numerous other artists. The song version by Jeff Beck featuring Joss Stone\, was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal at 53rd Grammy Awards.  Covers and samples  Shane MacGowan and Friends cover  Shane MacGowan\, Nick Cave\, Bobby Gillespie\, Chrissie Hynde\, Mick Jones and a guitar-wielding Johnny Depp joined forces to release their take on "I Put A Spell On You" in aid of Concern Worldwide's work in Haiti. Moved by the plight of the people of Haiti following the devastating 2010 earthquake\, McGowan and his long term girlfriend Victoria Clarke quickly assembled a group of friends and set about recording a version of the song. "I Put A Spell On You" was released on March 8\, 2010\, via download only.  "I Put a Spell on You" has been covered very many times\, perhaps most famously by Nina Simone in 1965\, Alan Price in 1966\, and Bette Midler in the 1993 movie Hocus Pocus. Other artists to record the song include:  Casey Abrams Howlin' Pelle Almqvist The Animals Natacha Atlas Audience Jimmy Barnes Batmobile Jeff Beck and Joss Stone Tab Benoit The Birthday Party Arthur Brown Eric Burdon performed it live at his show in Lugano in 2006. C.A. Quintet Cameo Caterina Caselli Italian singer (cover "Puoi farmi piangere"\, 1966) Champion with guest vocalist Betty Bonifassi Ray Charles Joe Cocker Creedence Clearwater Revival (who also performed it at Woodstock) Tim Curry Dionysos Julien Doré Eels Estelle Bryan Ferry Jools Holland with Mica Paris and David Gilmour Diamanda Galás The Guards (1968) Buddy Guy (featuring Carlos Santana) The Heavy The Kills Jarboe Logan Kendell (feat.

Bonnie Tyler  Most of the covers treat the song seriously; few attempt to duplicate Hawkins's bravura performance. Arthur Brown comes close.  In 1967\, the arrangement was used once more for Frank Sinatra's "The World We Knew (Over and Over)".  Also\, it has been sampled on tracks by The Notorious B.I.G. ("Kick In The Door")\, The Beatnuts ("Se Acabo")\, LL Cool J and The Heavy ("Sixteen"). Producers Cookin' Soul reworked the sample used by The Notorious B.I.G\, incorporating more elements of the original song and changing the tempo\, and released a song featuring Styles P of The LOX.  The song has been used as the exit music for the annual Halloween fireworks show HalloWishes at Walt Disney World in Florida. It can also be heard at the end of Halloween Screams at Disneyland and Disney's Nightmare in the Sky at Hong Kong Disneyland.  The title of the song was borrowed to name one of the quests in the role-playing game Fallout New Vegas\, as one of the numerous references and allusions to the music of the 1940s\, 1950s\, and 1960s in that game.  The song also functions as an important motif in the classic 1984 independent film by Jim Jarmusch Stranger than Paradise. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	1

COL title VAL Before the Next Teardrop Falls COL performer VAL Sammi Smith	COL video title VAL Someday Sweetheart By Chet Atkins & Les Paul COL description VAL Two of the greatest guitarist ever !!  Chet Atkins was an American guitarist and record producer who helped create the music style known as the Nashville sound.  While mostly associated with country music\, he also recorded and performed most other genres\, including jazz and classical.   He received 14 Grammy Awards\, the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award\, and 9 CMA Instrumentalist of the Year awards.  Atkins was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.  Les Paul was an American jazz\, popular and country guitarist\, songwriter and inventor.  He was a pioneer in the development of the solid-body electric guitar which "made the sound of rock and roll possible".  He recorded with his wife Mary Ford in the 1950s\, and they sold millions of records with 16 top-10 hits.  Among his many honors\, Paul is one of a handful of artists with a permanent\, stand-alone exhibit in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.  While not the first to use the technique\, his experiments with overdubbing were the first to attract widespread attention.  His innovations extended into his playing style\, including licks\, trills\, chording sequences\, fretting techniques and timing.  This selection is from the album "Chester & Lester" which reached #11 in 1976 and #27 again in 1978.  "Chester & Lester" won the Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance of 1976.

COL title VAL Baby\, What You Want Me to Do COL performer VAL Lou Rawls	COL video title VAL Bees Make Honey - Bloodshot Eyes COL description VAL Album: Music Every Night(1973). Bees Make Honey was one of the most influential band in the early Pub rock movement in the UK. Formed late in 1971 in north London by Barry Richardson\, Ruan O’Lochlainn\, Deke O’Brien and Mick Molloy\, former members of Irish showband The Alpine Seven\, and American drummer Bob “Cee” Siebenberg\, who would later rise to fame in Supertramp. While touring heavily on the emerging Pub rock circuit\, Bees Make Honey signed with record label EMI to record its debut album "Music Every Night". By the time the album was released\, the band was already beginning to break up. Frequent line-up changes preceded the dissolution of the band in 1974. Richardson went onto his own Barry Richardson Band. Demick and Finlayson subsequently resurfaced in Meal Ticket and Byrne moved onto Ace. Ruan O'Lochlainn formed Riff Raff with a young Biilly Bragg. Produced by manager Robinson - this is probably one of the best of Pub Rock albums. Largely written by Richardson  and O'Brien\, exemplified by tracks such as "Kentucky Chicken Fry" and "Booterstown" the album's full of taunt and enthusiastic rockers. Imminently likeable\, to be honest there are only a few missteps including the mildly country-flavored title track. Curiously the set didn't see an American release.

COL title VAL O sole mio COL performer VAL Franco Pagani	COL video title VAL Teddy Randazzo - Kiddio (Alan Freed's Mr. Rock and Roll) COL description VAL Teddy Randazzo was never quite as visible as other New York-spawned rock 'n' roll talent of the 1950's -- to name a few\, Dion was more of a star and for a lot longer\, and the various members of Jay & The Americans enjoyed hits right to the outset of the 1970's. But Randazzo had his day in the sun as a singer\, and he also wrote hundreds of songs\, and saw many dozens of recordings of the best of his work. Born in Brooklyn in 1937\, he was lucky enough to grow up in a musical family\, and by 15 was a good enough accordion player to turn professional\, as a member of the group the Three Chuckles\, who were in the market for a new keyboardman and singer -- the singing took a little time to develop\, with help from his decade-older fellow group members Tommy Romano and Russ Gilberto\, but when the group started recording\, it was the sides that Randazzo sang on that initially hit\, and by 1955\, at 17\, he was the frontman for the group. They had a number one hit with "And The Angels Sing"\, which had a rocking beat and brought them to the attention of deejay Alan Freed\, who put the group into his first jukebox movie\, Rock\, Rock\, Rock (shot in New York\, in the Bronx\, actually)\, but also gave Randazzo a solo spot.  When the smoke cleared from the movie\, Randazzo had decided to go solo. He continued recording for Vik Records\, a unit of RCA Victor\, and enjoyed a minor success in 1958 with "Little Serenade"\, and made an appearance in Freed's next movie\, Mister Rock And Roll\, as well as in the 20th Century-Fox CinemaScope color production The Girl Can't Help It\, among other movies. By 1960\, he'd moved to ABC-Paramount\, where he had another minor hit with "The Way Of A Clown"\, and in 1963 he had another small hit with "Big Wide World" on the Colpix label. But it was mostly as a songwriter and producer that Randazzo busied himself and made his real success in the music business; he wrote some 650 songs over the ensuing decades\, and saw them recorded by the likes of Frank Sinatra and Dionne Warwick. "Pretty Blue Eyes"\, authored with Bob Weinstein\, was a number one hit for Steve Lawrence. But it was with Little Anthony & The Imperials that he had his longest success -- in addition to producing the group\, he authored "Going Out Of My Head"\, "I'm On The Outside Looking In"\, and "Hurt So Bad" (later covered by Linda Ronstadt)\, among other hits.  Randazzo became less visible as the 1960's wore on\, and in the 1970's was largely forgotten by all except oldies fans. He remained active as a songwriter and behind-the-scenes\, and did the occasional live performance to keep his hand in\, but by then he was earning a good income from his annual royalties. He busied himself in local production in both Florida and Hawaii\, especially the latter\, and reportedly enjoyed a very happy second marriage -- his son from his first marriage\, Teddy Randazzo Jr.\, has also had a successful music career. Randazzo died in his sleep in 2003. ~ Bruce Eder\, All Music Guide  PLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels\, Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

COL title VAL I've Got You Under My Skin COL performer VAL Ray Noble and His Orchestra	COL video title VAL Gene Vincent - For your Precious Love (Town Hall Party - 1958) COL description VAL Gene Vincent only had one really big hit\, "Be-Bop-a-Lula\," which epitomized rockabilly at its prime in 1956 with its sharp guitar breaks\, spare snare drums\, fluttering echo\, and Vincent's breathless\, sexy vocals. Yet his place as one of the great early rock & roll singers is secure\, backed up by a wealth of fine smaller hits and non-hits that rate among the best rockabilly of all time. The leather-clad\, limping\, greasy-haired singer was also one of rock's original bad boys\, lionized by romanticists of past and present generations attracted to his primitive\, sometimes savage style and indomitable spirit. Vincent was bucking the odds by entering professional music in the first place. As a 20-year-old in the Navy\, he suffered a severe motorcycle accident that almost resulted in the amputation of his leg\, and left him with a permanent limp and considerable chronic pain for the rest of his life. After the accident he began to concentrate on building a musical career\, playing with country bands around the Norfolk\, VA\, area. Demos cut at a local radio station\, fronting a band assembled around Gene by his management\, landed Gene Vincent & the Blue Caps a contract at Capitol\, which hoped they'd found competition for Elvis Presley. Indeed it had\, as by this time Vincent had plunged into all-out rockabilly\, capable of both fast-paced exuberance and whispery\, almost sensitive ballads. The Blue Caps were one of the greatest rock bands of the '50s\, anchored at first by the stunning silvery\, faster-than-light guitar leads of Cliff Gallup. The slap-back echo of "Be-Bop-a-Lula\," combined with Gene's swooping vocals\, led many to mistake the singer for Elvis when the record first hit the airwaves in mid-1956\, on its way to the Top Ten. The Elvis comparison wasn't entirely fair; Vincent had a gentler\, less melodramatic style\, capable of both whipping up a storm or winding down to a hush. Brilliant follow-ups like "Race With the Devil\," "Bluejean Bop\," and "B-I-Bickey\, Bi\, Bo-Bo-Go" failed to click in nearly as big a way\, although these too are emblematic of rockabilly at its most exuberant and powerful. By the end of 1956\, the Blue Caps were beginning to undergo the first of constant personnel changes that would continue throughout the '50s\, the most crucial loss being the departure of Gallup. The 35 or so tracks he cut with the band -- many of which showed up only on albums or b-sides -- were unquestionably Vincent's greatest work\, as his subsequent recordings would never again capture their pristine clarity and uninhibited spontaneity. Vincent had his second and final Top Twenty hit in 1957 with "Lotta Lovin'\," which reflected his increasingly tamer approach to production and vocals\, the wildness and live atmosphere toned down in favor of poppier material\, more subdued guitars\, and conventional-sounding backup singers. He recorded often for Capitol throughout the rest of the '50s\, and it's unfair to dismiss those sides out of hand; they were respectable\, occasionally exciting rockabilly\, only a marked disappointment in comparison with his earliest work. His act was captured for posterity in one of the best scenes of one of the first Hollywood films to feature rock & roll stars\, The Girl Can't Help It. Live\, Vincent continued to rock the house with reckless intensity and showmanship\, and he became particularly popular overseas. A 1960 tour of Britain\, though\, brought tragedy when his friend Eddie Cochran\, who shared the bill on Vincent's U.K. shows\, died in a car accident that he was also involved in\, though Vincent survived. By the early '60s\, his recordings had become much more sporadic and lower in quality\, and his chief audience was in Europe\, particularly in England (where he lived for a while) and France. His Capitol contract expired in 1963\, and he spent the rest of his life recording for several other labels\, none of which got him close to that comeback hit. Vincent never stopped trying to resurrect his career\, appearing at a 1969 Toronto rock festival on the same bill as John Lennon\, though his medical\, drinking\, and marital problems were making his life a mess\, and diminishing his stage presence as well. He died at the age of 36 from a ruptured stomach ulcer\, one of rock's first mythic figures. ~ Richie Unterberger\, Rovi  PLEASE NOTE:  I divided my uploads among multiple channels\,  Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.
