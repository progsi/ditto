COL title VAL My Heart Would Know COL performer VAL The Osborne Brothers	COL video title VAL Tramp\, Tramp\, Tramp\, the Boys Are Marching COL description VAL A song by George Root\, detailing the life of a Union prisoner in the Civil War.  In the prison cell I sit\, Thinking Mother dear of you\, And our bright and happy home so far away\, And the tears they fill my eyes Spite of all that I can do Though I try to cheer my comrades and be gay.  Chorus: Tramp! tramp! tramp! The boys are marching Cheer up comrades\, They will come. And beneath the starry flag We shall breathe the air again Of the free land in our own beloved home.  In the battle front we stood When their fiercest charge they made\, And they swept us off a hundred men or more; But before we reached their lines They were beaten back\, dismayed\, And we heard the cry of vict'ry o'er and o'er.  So within the prison cell We are waiting for the day That shall come to open wide the iron door; And the hollow eye grows bright And the poor heart almost gay As we think of seing home and friends once more.

It was released on the band's fifth full-length studio album\, Document\, and also as a 7" vinyl single in 1987. The song was their first hit single\, reaching #9 in the US Billboard Hot 100\, #14 in Canada\, and later reached #16 in the UK singles chart on its UK release (1991).  The song was included in Activision's Guitar Hero World Tour and is in Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades.  The accompanying video's director was artist Robert Longo.  The director of photography was Alton Brown\, who later became a Food Network chef.  In March 2005\, Q magazine placed "The One I Love" at number 57 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks.  The song is included on R.E.M. Live.  Lyrics and meaning  Many listeners who misunderstand the song's meaning have made the song a popular radio dedication to loved ones\, relying on the main lyric\, "This one goes out to the one I love."  However\, they missed an ensuing line: "A simple prop to occupy my time"; the song was not particularly a love song.  Stipe related in 1987 to Rolling Stone\, "I've always left myself pretty open to interpretation. It's probably better that they just think it's a love song at this point."  However\, in an interview in the January 1988 issue of Musician magazine he said that the song was "incredibly violent" and "It's very clear that it's about using people over and over again".  The song contains only three verses\, which are all near identical\, with small variations each repeat of the verse. (For example "A simple prop to occupy my time"\, "Another prop has occupied my time"). The chorus consists of just the word "fire"\, repeated (with the backing vocal of "She's coming down on her own now/Coming down on her own"\, sung by Mike Mills).  Cover versions  Bush Sufjan Stevens Massacre and many more. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

COL title VAL Save Tonight COL performer VAL Booost	COL video title VAL Frankie Laine - I'm Gonna Be Strong (1963) COL description VAL The original version of this song\, which became a Top 10 hit for Gene Pitney in 1964. Later recorded by Blue Angel (with Cyndi Lauper on lead) in 1980. Frankie's single did not chart nationally in Billboard \, but charted locally in the Top 40 of the WENE 1430 AM radio survey chart in Endicott\, New York\, in November 1963 and the Top 70 in Philadelphia\, Pennsylvania. Original Billboard review: "Frankie Laine has a strong side here somewhat in the same groove as his last single which saw chart action.

COL title VAL I'm Glad for Your Sake (But I'm Sorry for Mine) COL performer VAL Joey Long	COL video title VAL LURLEAN HUNTER  Vocal Jazz Swing. Steppin' Out With My Baby \, I Feel COL description VAL Lurlean Hunter  Singer Lurlean Hunter made five albums on her own during the second half of the '50s\, starting out as a Lonesome Gal on RCA and winding up still feeling Blue & Sentimental for Atlantic. She was discovered in Chicago where she had been singing in many clubs\, including a collaboration with drummer Red Saunders that held forth at the Club DeLisa. Hunter's move to New York City in 1955 was prompted by RCA's interest in recording her. The singer's recording career actually began before she left the Windy City at the behest of indie jazz labels\, some of them quite short-lived -- such as Seymour\, with a catalog topping out at four releases. The press described Hunter as a "blues thrush" in announcing her interpretations of three numbers actually written by the label's owner\, producer and record store owner Seymour Schwartz. The latter promotional blurb inevitably told some truth about Hunter's stylistic traits\, if not her relation to winged fauna. Her recordings were more about rhythm & blues and pop than jazz\, yet were done in an era when such sessions often involved fine mainstream jazz players in the accompaniment. The 1956Night Life\, for example\, featured pianist Hank Jones and tenor saxophonist Al Cohn. Blue & Sentimental -- with arrangements by the progressive Jimmy Giuffre -- was reissued in 2000 as a split CD also including an album by fellow singer Betty Bennett\, a former wife of pianist André Previn.Hunter's final recordings were done in 1964\, at which point she was still well under 40 years old. She is known to have died young\, although details of this tragedy are murky. In one version of the story she was knocked off by a mobster lover\, yet whether anybody was really that mean to Lurlean cannot be completely confirmed.

Her style was a hybrid of Brill Building-style New York pop\, jazz\, gospel\, rhythm and blues\, show tunes\, rock and soul.  She was best known\, and enjoyed her greatest commercial success\, as a composer and lyricist rather than as a performer. Between 1968 and 1970 a number of other singers had significant hits with her songs: The 5th Dimension with "Blowing Away"\, "Wedding Bell Blues"\, "Stoned Soul Picnic"\, "Sweet Blindness"\, "Save The Country" and "Black Patch"; Blood\, Sweat & Tears and Peter\, Paul & Mary with "And When I Die"; Three Dog Night with "Eli's Coming"; and Barbra Streisand with "Stoney End"\, "Time and Love"\, and "Hands off the Man (Flim Flam Man)". Nyro's best-selling single was her recording of Carole King and Gerry Goffin's "Up on the Roof."   Lyrics:  Loving you so I was too blind to see you letting me go But now that you've set me free It's gonna take a miracle Yes\, it's gonna take a miracle To make me love someone new Cause I'm crazy for you  Oh oh\, didn't you know It wouldn't be so easy lettin' you go I could have told you that it's gonna take a miracle  oh-uh Yes\, it's gonna take a miracle To make me love someone new Cause I'm crazy for you  Oh\, tho' I know I can't forget? about you or come so? will show you how much You're turning me around\, destroying me I'll never be the same anymore  You must realize You took your love and left me Quite by surprise You can be sure that now it's gonna take a miracle Yes\, it's gonna take a miracle To make me love someone new Cause I'm crazy for you COL channel name VAL Mr.Lotsopa	0

COL title VAL Ride Your Pony COL performer VAL Lee Dorsey	COL video title VAL The Newbeats -_I'm Blue - (The Gong-Gong)_1964 Hickory.wmv COL description VAL Texan Larry Henley first performed with the Dean and Marc Combo in 1962. Business links with Nashville-based Hickory Records owner Wesley Rose rapidly led to solo releases by Larry Henley and also\, Dean and Marc.  In June 1964\, Larry\, Dean and Marc got together and cut an unusual\, falsetto-driven demo of the Everly Brothers' "Bye Bye Love." The song's composer\, Bouldleaux Bryant\, heard the dazzling demo and immediately convinced Wesley Rose to sign the trio to a separate\, (third!) recording contract. Fred Foster\, owner of Monument Records\, suggested the "Newbeats" name.  Holland Picture Sleeve - Bye Bye Love was never released on 45 in the USA  "Bye Bye Love\," "Break Away (From That Boy)" (later a #34 hit in Cash Box) and the Chevrolet Corvair tune "Tough Little Buggy" were duly recorded on June 28\, 1964. At the last minute Rose's brother-in-law suggested a song called "Bread And Butter." Dean Mathis created a new\, authoritative arrangement on the spot\, showcasing Larry Henley's scorching\, gospel-influenced falsetto.  When released\, "Bread And Butter" was buried on the 'B' side of "Tough Little Buggy." But DJs at Detroit's WKNR radio flipped the single and "Bread And Butter" blasted onto the WKNR survey the week of July 16\, 1964\, soon peaking at #1.  Nationally "Bread And Butter" shot to #2 and attained Gold sales.  The Newbeats' jaw-dropping national TV debut took place Wednesday\, September 30\, 1964 on ABC-TV's 'Shindig.'  An appearance on 'American Bandstand' came next. The group then stormed Europe via Holland's 'Grand Gala du Disque 1964\,' a widely seen\, four hour television spectacular.   Billboard September 12\, 1964  In addition to "A Patent On Love" (originally intended for Joey "Midnight Mary" Powers) and "Pink Dally Rue" (later recorded by Jimmy Elledge and Robin Wilson)\, the 'Bread & Butter' album included "Thou Shalt Not Steal\," penned by longtime Hickory confederate John D. Loudermilk ("Norman\," "Talk Back Trembling Lips"). Dick and Deedee recognized the potential of the album cut and soon lodged a version of "Thou Shalt Not Steal" at #13 on the charts (Warner single 5482). Another Loudermilk tune\, the #16 "Everything's Alright\," became the Newbeats' follow-up to "Bread And Butter."  From January 22 through February 13\, 1965\, the Newbeats toured Australia and New Zealand with the Rolling Stones\, Roy Orbison and Rolf Harris. During the tour\, Larry Henley became very close to Mick Jagger and the two even planned an album project. Hickory owner Wesley Rose managed tour headliner Roy Orbison. The Newbeats later recorded Orbison's "Oh\, Pretty Woman" and "Lookin' For Love."  "(The Bees Are For The Birds) The Birds Are For The Bees\," was written by the composers of "Bread And Butter\," Larry Parks and Jay Turnbow\, with help from Bob Finnicum. While "Bread And Butter" had referred to sex in sympathetic gastronomic terms\, the refreshingly naïve "Birds Are For The Bees" found Larry Henley (27)\, Dean Mathis (28) and Marc Mathis (25) innocently claiming\, "Grown-ups tell me the birds and the bees do other things than live in trees" and concluding\, to the astonishment of angst-ridden teen listeners\, "I don't care if they can fly it's got nothing to do with you and I."  Issued with two different front covers\, the April 1965 album 'Big Beat Sounds' showcased the Newbeats' most recent single sides. The aforementioned Larry Parks\, Jay Turnbow and Bob Finnicum contributed three additional quirky tunes to the album. 'Big Beat Sounds' also contained valuable material such as Goffin and King's lead-off cut "I Can't Hear You No More" and Keith Colley and Nancie Mantz's closer "Human Kindness."  Colley and Mantz had penned tunes for Rick Nelson ("That's All She Wrote")\, Bobby Bare ("Talk Me Some Sense") and Skeeter Davis ("Ladder Of Success"). Nanci Mantz later co-wrote several songs for the Electric Prunes\, including "I Had Too Much To Dream (Last Night)."  The driving "Little Child" was released as a single in the summer of 1965. Oddly\, it did not drive the national charts wild. But the group's publicity blitz continued unabated with appearances on ABC-TV's 'Where The Action Is' on July 20 and August 25\, 1965.  The Newbeats scored a major comeback with the September 1965 single\, "Run\, Baby Run." The #12 hit boasted exquisite vocal harmonies and a stomping Motown beat. And "Run\, Baby Run" had legs; in 1971 it went Top Ten in England. Roy Orbison and the Tremelos even cut versions of the influential tune.  November 1965 saw 'Run\, Baby Run\,' the Newbeats' third and final Hickory album. Remakes of the Isley Brothers' "This Old Heart" and the Supremes' "Come See About Me" boldly demonstrated the influence of Motown soul while covers of "Help" and "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction" recognized the Beatles and Rolling Stones.

Gaby Moreno	COL video title VAL Charlie Parker: Dexterity COL description VAL Charles "Charlie" Parker\, Jr. (August 29\, 1920 -- March 12\, 1955)\, also known as "Yardbird" and "Bird"\, was an American jazz saxophonist and composer. Parker acquired the nickname "Yardbird" early in his career and the shortened form\, "Bird"\, which continued to be used for the rest of his life\, inspired the titles of a number of Parker compositions\, such as "Yardbird Suite"\, "Ornithology"\, "Bird Gets the Worm"\, and "Bird of Paradise." Parker was a highly influential jazz soloist and a leading figure in the development of bebop\, a form of jazz characterized by fast tempos\, virtuosic technique\, and improvisation. Parker introduced revolutionary harmonic ideas\, including rapid passing chords\, new variants of altered chords\, and chord substitutions. His tone ranged from clean and penetrating to sweet and somber. Many Parker recordings demonstrate virtuosic technique and complex melodic lines\, sometimes combining jazz with other musical genres\, including blues\, Latin\, and classical. Parker was an icon for the hipster subculture and later the Beat Generation\, personifying the jazz musician as an uncompromising artist and intellectual\, rather than an entertainer... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Parker   A link to this wonderful artist's personal website: http://www.cmgww.com/music/parker/home.html   Please Enjoy!

The Cat Came Back COL description VAL Now old Mr. Johnson had troubles of his own\, He had a yellow cat that wouldn't leave his home\, He tried and he tried to get that cat away\, Gave it to a man going far away.  But the cat came back\, the very next day\, The cat came back\, they thought he was a goner\, But the cat came back\, just wouldn't stay away.  Now the man around the corner swore he'd kill the cat on sight\, He loaded up his shotgun with nails and dynamites\, He waited and he waited for the cat to come around\, Ninety-seven pieces of the man is all they found.  But the cat came back\, the very next day\, The cat came back\, they thought he was a goner\, But the cat came back\, just wouldn't stay away.  Gave it to a little boy with a dollar note\, Told him for to take it up the river in a boat\, They tied a rope around its neck it must've weighed a pound\, Now they drag the river for the little boy it's drowned.  But the cat came back\, the very next day\, The cat came back\, they thought he was a goner\, But the cat came back\, just wouldn't stay away.  Gave it to man going up in a balloon\, Told him for to take it to the man on the Moon\, The balloon came down about 90 miles away\, Where he is now\, I dare not say.  But the cat came back\, the very next day\, The cat came back\, they thought he was a goner\, But the cat came back\, just wouldn't stay away.  They gave it to a man going way out west\, Told him for to take it to the one he loved the best\, First\, the train hit the curve\, then it jumped the rail\, Not a soul was left behind to tell the gruesome tale.  But the cat came back\, the very next day\, The cat came back\, they thought he was a goner\, But the cat came back\, just wouldn't stay away\, away\, away\, away.  Away across the ocean he did send the cat at last\, Vessel out alone today taking water fast\, People all began to pray the boat began to toss\, A great big gust of wind came by and every soul was lost.  But the cat came back\, the very next day\, The cat came back\, they thought he was a goner\, But the cat came back\, just wouldn't stay away.  On a telegraph wire\, sparrows sitting in a bunch\, The cat was feeling hungry\, thought she'd like them for a lunch\, Climb softly up the pole\, when she reached the top\, Put her foot in the electric wire\, which tied her in a knot.  But the cat came back\, the very next day\, The cat came back\, they thought he was a goner\, But the cat came back\, just wouldn't stay away.  Now the cat was a possessor of a family of a own\, With seven little kittens and along came a cyclone\, Blew the houses all apart and tossed the cat around\, The air was full of kittens and not a one was found.  But the cat came back\, the very next day\, The cat came back\, they thought she was a goner\, But the cat came back\, just wouldn't stay away\, away\, away\, away\, Just wouldn't stay away.

COL title VAL My Immortal COL performer VAL Julia Westlin	COL video title VAL Shanley Del - Day After Day (Non-LP Track) COL description VAL Here's a much-sought-after Non-LP track from New Zealand/Aussie artist\, Shanley Del.  It was the 3rd track on her 2001 CD Single\, released in Australia by rooArt Records\, cat. # 74321848392. The other two tracks\, "Sleep" and "All I Want" were also on her album "The Other Side"\, but this track was an orphan...to my knowledge\, this single is the only place it was ever issued.  It is a gentle\, acoustic-pop remake of the Badfinger classic.  Prior to this release\, Shanley was considered a country artist\, but\, this album had much more of a Pop flavour\, which I guess accounts for the album title\, "The Other Side". As part of the new image\, she also dropped the 'Del" from her name...on this release\, she is simply called "Shanley".  *** If you like my channel\, why not SUBSCRIBE?

COL title VAL Ce n'est pas une vie COL performer VAL Les Terribles	COL video title VAL Leslie West - Politician.wmv COL description VAL Leslie West - Got Blooze (2005) Guitar hero Leslie West has issued countless albums over the years\, mostly either as a member of Mountain or as a solo artist. But he has never set out to record an album comprised entirely of classic blues rockers. Then 2005's Got Blooze came along. While this sort of thing has been done by countless fellow veteran classic rock acts of late (the best-known of the bunch being Aerosmith's Honkin' on Bobo)\, it turns out to be custom-made for a player like West. Throughout the 12-track set\, West keeps things raw and gritty\, as evidenced by such standouts as the extraordinary "Third Degree" and a cover of the oft-overlooked Cream gem\, "Politician." West also surrounds himself with a fantastic rhythm section\, comprised of Vanilla Fudge's Tim Bogert on bass and session ace Aynsley Dunbar on drums (turns out the pair pulled double duty\, as they also backed ex-Ozzy Osbourne guitarist Jake E. Lee on an additional album full of covers\, Retraced).

He was featured on the RCA Radiotron Varieties on WEAF\, New York\, and other programs and sometimes sang duets with contralto Welcome Lewis and soprano Margaret Daum. While he was known mainly as a tenor\, some of the published radio guides identified him as a baritone. He performed on radio with the William Wirges Orchestra and with Zoel Parenteau's Orchestra. He recorded as a vocalist for several record labels and orchestras between 1927 and 1937 including Enoch Light (1927)\, Veo's Hotel McAlpin Orchestra (1928-29). He recorded several sides for Russ Carton's High Steppers Orchestra on the Crown label and in 1932 he made a series of recordings as Harold Van Emburgh and his Orchestra which also featured his singing. Between 1934 and 1937 he was a vocalist with Jolly Coburn and His Orchestra for Victor Records.  "Home" was first recorded by composer and band leader\, Peter Van Steeden and his Orchestra on the Victor label. His collaborators were the father and son songwriters\, Harry and Jeff Clarkson. It soon became Van Steeden's theme song. It has been very popular song for many years sometimes with the alternate title\, "When Shadows Fall". It has been sung by Andrews Sisters in the 1944 film \, "Moonlight and Cactus". In 1950 was recorded by Nat King Cole.  There was an instrumental version by the Ventures in 1960. Paul McCartney recorded it in 2012.  Many others have performed this song\, including\, Ruth Etting\, Louis Armstrong\, Rudy Vallee\, The Mills Brothers and Sam Cooke. COL channel name VAL bsgs98	1

COL title VAL Baby\, Let Me Hold Your Hand COL performer VAL Professor Longhair	COL video title VAL Macabre - Morbid Campfire Songs - 4. The Cat Came Back COL description VAL Now old Mr. Johnson had troubles of his own\, He had a yellow cat that wouldn't leave his home\, He tried and he tried to get that cat away\, Gave it to a man going far away.  But the cat came back\, the very next day\, The cat came back\, they thought he was a goner\, But the cat came back\, just wouldn't stay away.  Now the man around the corner swore he'd kill the cat on sight\, He loaded up his shotgun with nails and dynamites\, He waited and he waited for the cat to come around\, Ninety-seven pieces of the man is all they found.  But the cat came back\, the very next day\, The cat came back\, they thought he was a goner\, But the cat came back\, just wouldn't stay away.  Gave it to a little boy with a dollar note\, Told him for to take it up the river in a boat\, They tied a rope around its neck it must've weighed a pound\, Now they drag the river for the little boy it's drowned.  But the cat came back\, the very next day\, The cat came back\, they thought he was a goner\, But the cat came back\, just wouldn't stay away.  Gave it to man going up in a balloon\, Told him for to take it to the man on the Moon\, The balloon came down about 90 miles away\, Where he is now\, I dare not say.  But the cat came back\, the very next day\, The cat came back\, they thought he was a goner\, But the cat came back\, just wouldn't stay away.  They gave it to a man going way out west\, Told him for to take it to the one he loved the best\, First\, the train hit the curve\, then it jumped the rail\, Not a soul was left behind to tell the gruesome tale.  But the cat came back\, the very next day\, The cat came back\, they thought he was a goner\, But the cat came back\, just wouldn't stay away\, away\, away\, away.  Away across the ocean he did send the cat at last\, Vessel out alone today taking water fast\, People all began to pray the boat began to toss\, A great big gust of wind came by and every soul was lost.  But the cat came back\, the very next day\, The cat came back\, they thought he was a goner\, But the cat came back\, just wouldn't stay away.  On a telegraph wire\, sparrows sitting in a bunch\, The cat was feeling hungry\, thought she'd like them for a lunch\, Climb softly up the pole\, when she reached the top\, Put her foot in the electric wire\, which tied her in a knot.  But the cat came back\, the very next day\, The cat came back\, they thought he was a goner\, But the cat came back\, just wouldn't stay away.  Now the cat was a possessor of a family of a own\, With seven little kittens and along came a cyclone\, Blew the houses all apart and tossed the cat around\, The air was full of kittens and not a one was found.  But the cat came back\, the very next day\, The cat came back\, they thought she was a goner\, But the cat came back\, just wouldn't stay away\, away\, away\, away\, Just wouldn't stay away.

Suceda lo que suceda\, me quedaré aquí contigo. Lleva esto en los buenos tiempos\, velos pasar en los malos tiempos. Lo que sea que toque\, es lo que voy hacer.  Déjalos que digan que estamos locos\, qué van a saber ellos. Pon tus manos a mi alrededor\, bebé\, jamás permitas que se vaya. Deja que el mundo alrededor nuestro\, simplemente se venga abajo.

COL title VAL Hello Stranger COL performer VAL Fire & Rain	COL video title VAL Hello Stranger - The Supremes & The Four Tops COL description VAL Here is another outstanding cover from the third duet album from The Supremes & The Four Tops entitled "Dynamite" from 1971.  Aside from Barbara Lewis' 1963 original\, I think this version is the best of all the covers ever done of the song. It is musical perfection.  Written by: Barbara Lewis Produced by: Bobby Taylor and Frank Wilson Track recorded: May 3\, 1971 Additional overdubs\, strings and horn sessions recorded in Los Angeles: Dates unknown Levi Stubbs lead vocal recorded: June 5\, 1971 & August 17\, 1971 Four Tops background vocals recorded: June 9\, 1971 Jean Terrell lead vocal recorded: June 10\, 1971 Supremes background vocals recorded: June 24\, 1971  This version is the best song on the entire LP and one of the best duets the groups did together over the three albums. Motown was foolish not to release this as a single. It screams hit and would have been one had Motown promoted it\, but at the time The Supremes and The Four Tops were no longer Motown's top priority. Nonetheless\, it still remains an incredible cover.  ****No copyright infringement intended**** COL channel name VAL MotownConnoisseur30	1

COL title VAL With My Eyes Wide Open\, I'm Dreaming COL performer VAL Isham Jones and His Orchestra	COL video title VAL 'With my eyes wide open I'm dreaming'--Patti Page 'Quartet' (1949) COL description VAL Recorded in November 1949\, this is a classic example of 'multiple' recording\, as opposed to multitrack recording.  At the time this record was made there were no multitrack tape recorders.  In fact\, the studio this was recorded at (most likely Reeves in New York City) had yet to acquire tape equipment; hence\, this recording was made by first recording part of the music on one lacquer disc\, then playing this disc back through a mixer while another part was played or sung live along with the playback\, the mix of these parts being then recorded onto a second lacquer disc.  This was done four times (original recording plus three overdubs) to produce the four vocal parts heard on this record.   Les Paul was the first to produce successful 'multiples' (as he called them)\, both technically and artistically\, and what his label Capitol nicknamed 'The New Sound' spawned a brief fad where other performers tried to mimic his recording technique on their records\, with varying degrees of success.  This record was one of the better ones\, and Patti Page had several hits with this type of sound. COL channel name VAL PerisphereRec	1

Tindley was born in 1851 and died in 1936. He wrote this number in 1905 as "We"ll Understand It Better By and By." He might have recorded the number himself\, but this can't be confirmed. Tindley also wrote the song "I'll Overcome Some Day\," which later became know as "We Shall Overcome." Furthermore\, he wrote the gospel number "Stand By Me." Many sources imply that this is the song with which Ben E. King had a hit in the 1960s\, but that was a different number. However\, Elvis also recorded Tindley's "Stand By Me" for his own "How Great Thou Art" gospel collection. Brothers Frank and James McCravy from Laurens\, South Carolina\, recorded the number as "We'll Understand It Better Bye and Bye" (note the added "e"s on the words "By") in New York in February 1925\, for release on Okeh 40319. This was the McCravy's first recording session\, but they went on to record hundreds of tracks\, often using different names\, such as The Lonesome Pine Twins\, The Austin Brothers\, Al and Joe Blackburn\, Cox and Campbell\, and The Mack Brothers. They ended their recording career in 1935\, by which time they had recorded "We'll Understand It Better Bye and Bye" on at least two more occasions.

COL title VAL Tara's Theme COL performer VAL The Ventures	COL video title VAL 'With my eyes wide open I'm dreaming'--Patti Page 'Quartet' (1949) COL description VAL Recorded in November 1949\, this is a classic example of 'multiple' recording\, as opposed to multitrack recording.  At the time this record was made there were no multitrack tape recorders.  In fact\, the studio this was recorded at (most likely Reeves in New York City) had yet to acquire tape equipment; hence\, this recording was made by first recording part of the music on one lacquer disc\, then playing this disc back through a mixer while another part was played or sung live along with the playback\, the mix of these parts being then recorded onto a second lacquer disc.  This was done four times (original recording plus three overdubs) to produce the four vocal parts heard on this record.   Les Paul was the first to produce successful 'multiples' (as he called them)\, both technically and artistically\, and what his label Capitol nicknamed 'The New Sound' spawned a brief fad where other performers tried to mimic his recording technique on their records\, with varying degrees of success.  This record was one of the better ones\, and Patti Page had several hits with this type of sound. COL channel name VAL PerisphereRec	0

He's underneath the window\, she's singing\, "Hey la\, my boyfriend's back. You shouldn't come around here singing up to people like that... Anyway\, what you gonna do about it?"  ROMEO: Juliet\, the dice was loaded from the start And I bet when you exploded into my heart And I forget I forget the movie song. When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong\, Juliet?  Come up on different streets\, they're both the streets of shame. Both dirty\, both mean\, yes\, in the dream it was just the same And I dreamed your dream for you and now your dream is real. How can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals?  When you can fall for chains of silver\,  You can fall for chains of gold\, You can fall for pretty strangers  And the promises they hold. You promised me everything\, you promised me thick and thin\, yeah! Now you just say\, "Oh Romeo? Yeah\, you know I used to have a scene with him".  Juliet\, when we made love\, you used to cry. You said\, "I love you like the stars above\, I'll love you 'til I die". There's a place for us\, you know the movie song. When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong\, Juliet?  I can't do the talk\, like the talk on TV And I can't do a love song\, like the way it's meant to be. I can't do everything\, but I'll do anything for you. I can't do anything\, 'cept be in love with you! And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be. All I do is keep the beat... and bad company. Now all I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme\, Juliet\, I'd do the stars with you any time!  Juliet\, when we made love you used to cry. You said\, "I love you like the stars above\, I'll love you 'til I die". There's a place for us\, you know the movie song. When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong\, Juliet?

COL title VAL Jørgen Hattemaker COL performer VAL Alf Prøysen med Willy Andresens ensemble	COL video title VAL Uriah Heep - Lady in Black COL description VAL http://www.discogs.com/artist/Uriah+Heep http://www.myspace.com/uriaheep  Uriah Heep's by-the-books progressive heavy metal made the British band one of the most popular hard rock groups of the early '70s. Formed by vocalist David Byron and guitarist Mick Box in the late '60s\, the group went through an astonishing number of members over the next two decades — nearly 30 different musicians passed through the band over the years. Byron and Box were members of the mid-'60s rock band called the Stalkers; once that band broke up\, the duo formed another group called Spice. Spice would eventually turn into Uriah Heep in the late '60s\, once Ken Hensley (guitar\, keyboards\, vocals) and bassist Paul Newton joined the pair. Former Spice drummer Alex Napier was the band's drummer for a brief time; he was quickly replaced by Nigel Olsson. Uriah Heep released their debut album Very 'eavy...Very 'umble (called Uriah Heep in the U.S.) in 1970. After its release\, Keith Baker became the group's drummer; he recorded Salisbury\, the group's second album\, before deciding he couldn't keep up with the band's extensive touring and was replaced by Ian Clarke. Salisbury\, featuring a 16-minute title track recorded with a 26-piece orchestra\, showcased the band's more progressive tendencies. Later that year\, Ian Clarke was replaced by Lee Kerslake and Mark Clarke replaced Newton; Mark Clarke quickly left the band and Gary Thain became the group's bassist. This lineup of Uriah Heep was its most stable and popular; beginning with 1972's Demons and Wizards\, they released five albums between 1972 and 1975. After 1975\, the band's popularity began to slip. Byron left the band in 1977 and was replaced by John Lawton\, yet the group's fortunes kept declining right into the early '80s. However\, Uriah Heep soldiered on\, continuing to release albums into the '90s and 2000s. The album roster included Different World (1994)\, Sea of Light (1995)\, Sonic Origami (1998)\, and Spellbinder (1999). COL channel name VAL TheDeZyx	0

Link below COL description VAL https://youtu.be/gVrCs58PNUU This is a much better HD copy of the music\, plus Stay a Little Longer.  Westenr Swing music from the 1940s.  This has Noel Boggs on Steel\, which means after the war probably 1946. Alex Beshear on trumpet plays it without a mute.  That was quite unusual for him.  Also Tommy sings it.  When Bob made the Okey 78\, the vocalist was Danny Alguire\, who also played trumpet.  Tommy had joined the army when that session took play. So here we get to hear the way he would have done it.  Just wish the quality was better.  Notice the accordian?  Bob never used one in his recordings\, and I have to wonder where Noel plugged in his steel guitar.  Behind a tree?  Hot session\, though.

This album features the likes of Clive Langer\, Ian Broudie\, James Eller and Lee "Kix" Thompson of Madness. Bette Bright (real name Anne Martin) married Graham "Suggs" McPherson (no introduction necessary) and retired from music to start a family. Recently\, however\, she has re-emerged along with Deaf School\, playing several reunion and tribute gigs. Oh and any eagle-eyes among us will have spotted a red-wigged Bette in the Sex Pistols movie Rock 'N' Roll Swindle (check the scene where Steve Jones...soils the gold record).

COL title VAL From the Morning COL performer VAL Andrea Corr	COL video title VAL John Fogerty - Have Thine Own Way\, Lord.wmv COL description VAL The Blue Ridge Rangers Is the first solo album by John Fogerty\, the former lead singer and lead guitarist of Creedence Clearwater Revival. Upon its initial release by Fantasy Records in 1973\, the album was credited to "The Blue Ridge Rangers" with no mention of Fogerty on the cover. Fogerty chose to do this in order to distance himself from his Creedence legacy. The LP was later reissued and credited to John Fogerty with a different cover design. The CD reissue restores the original silhouette cover photo and credits the album to Fogerty. The album is made up entirely of traditional and country covers\, and features Fogerty playing all the instruments. The album peaked at #47 on the charts. Two singles from the album became hits: "Jambalaya" which peaked at #16\, and "Hearts of Stone" which peaked at #37. In 2009\, Fogerty released a sequel to this album\, entitled The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again.  Track listing Side one 1. "Blue Ridge Mountain Blues" (Traditional) -- 2:29 2.

ROMEO: Juliet\, the dice was loaded from the start And I bet when you exploded into my heart And I forget I forget the movie song. When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong\, Juliet?  Come up on different streets\, they're both the streets of shame. Both dirty\, both mean\, yes\, in the dream it was just the same And I dreamed your dream for you and now your dream is real. How can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals?  When you can fall for chains of silver\,  You can fall for chains of gold\, You can fall for pretty strangers  And the promises they hold. You promised me everything\, you promised me thick and thin\, yeah! Now you just say\, "Oh Romeo? Yeah\, you know I used to have a scene with him".  Juliet\, when we made love\, you used to cry. You said\, "I love you like the stars above\, I'll love you 'til I die". There's a place for us\, you know the movie song. When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong\, Juliet?  I can't do the talk\, like the talk on TV And I can't do a love song\, like the way it's meant to be. I can't do everything\, but I'll do anything for you. I can't do anything\, 'cept be in love with you! And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be. All I do is keep the beat... and bad company. Now all I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme\, Juliet\, I'd do the stars with you any time!  Juliet\, when we made love you used to cry.

I haven't posted anything just to show you "what I can pull out of the crate." These are all songs that I know\, love and listen to every day. So\, if you're with that special someone\, press play and let the music get you in the mood. If you're missing that special someone\, then I hope this takes you where you want to be... At least for a while. And if you don't have a special someone\, it is my desire that these songs of love bring you HOPE!!! God has someone for you. I know it. His Word says that "God sets the solitary in families!" Did you hear that? God will give you a family!!! Glory to God. I pray that you are blessed day in and day out!

This one was uploaded originally in Mar 20\, 2011 - 6\,231views)  ------------------------  "Sunday Girl" is a 1978 song written and recorded by the American group Blondie. The track was a no. 1 hit in the UK Singles Chart for three weeks in May 1979\, but despite this was not released as a single in the United States.  Song information  The song was written by Chris Stein and was the fourth single to be taken from the album\, Parallel Lines\, in the UK and most other parts of the world. The single had an unusual release in Australia\, with some dispute among fans as to whether it reached no. 1 there or failed to chart. This is because of its initial release as the lead single from Parallel Lines\, due to its being reminiscent of "In The Flesh"\, Blondie's first hit in Australia. "Sunday Girl" failed to chart\, however\, and was later re-released as a double A-side with "Heart of Glass"\, on the back of its UK success. As a result\, it was eclipsed by the disco track\, and is rarely recognised as having charted in its own right.  A French-language version of the track was released in the UK on the "Sunday Girl" 12" single; in France and the Netherlands\, it was the B-side of the 7". It also appears on the cassette release of Eat to the Beat. For Blondie's first greatest hits album The Best of Blondie in 1981\, producer Mike Chapman created a special mix which incorporated one verse sung in French. The bilingual version appears on the 2002 compilation Greatest Hits.  In 2010 a remake of this song was made by the English performer Florrie. It had slightly different lyrics and was used for a Nina Ricci perfume commercial. The song was covered in 2013 by the band She & Him on the album Volume 3.  In 2013 Blondie themselves re-recorded the song and offered it to be included in the CBGB's film soundtrack. This version was included on their 2014 compilation album Greatest Hits Deluxe Redux. The compilation was part of a 2-disc set called Blondie 4(0) Ever which included their 10th studio album Ghosts of Download and marked the 40th anniversary of the forming of the band.

COL description VAL (1928 Version Written by Bascom Lamar Lunsford...1939 Version Written by Scott Wiseman)   Lunsford was not only a folklorist but also a lawyer\, who defended clients in criminal cases involving moonshining during the 1920s in North Carolina. He wrote a ballad based on this experience and recorded it in 1928. In 1935\, his friend Scotty Wiseman added the modern chorus and replaced verses about a man appearing in court with verses about making moonshine. Two years later Lunsford sold the song to Wiseman for $25 so he could buy a train ticket back to North Carolina from the National Folk Festival in Chicago. Wiseman copyrighted the song and made sure 50% of the royalties earned were given to Lunsford until his death.

Thus Bessie Jones's dramatic dialogue between Death and the reluctant sinner might just as well have its roots in an African tradition as in the popular religious poems and dramas of medieval Europe in which death was so frequently personified. Chorus O Death in the mornin'\, (3 times) Spare me over another year. Well\, Death walked up into the sinner's gaze\, Says\, "B'lieve you have waited now a little too late\, Your fever now is one hundred and two\, Have a narrow chance if you ever pull through." (Chorus) He cried\, "O Death\," Cryin'\, "O Death in the mornin'\, O Death\, Death\, spare me over in another year. Hey\, what is this I see\, Cold\, icy hands all over me? You say\, "I am Death\, no one can excel\, I span the doors of Death and Hell." (Chorus) 11 "No\, you heard God's people sing and pray\, You would not heed\, you just walked away\, You would not even bend your knee\, Now you got to come and go with me. (Chorus) "Well\, I'm gon' fix your feet so you cannot walk\, 'M fix your tongue where you cannot talk\, Close your eyes and you cannot see\, And you got to come and go with me." (Chorus) "Well\, Death\, consider my age\, And do not take me in this stage\, Because all of my wealth is at your command\, If you'll just move your cold\, icy hand." (Chorus) He cried\, "No no\, O Death in the mornin'\, No no\, Lord\, spare me over in another year."  - Alan Lomax COL channel name VAL TheBWJohnson	0

COL title VAL One Dance COL performer VAL Conor Maynard feat. Harper	COL video title VAL Bob Luman - Early in The Morning (1958) COL description VAL Bob Luman on His 4th appearence on Town Hall Party at 1958.  ---ABOUT THE SONG--- "Early In The Morning" [US #24 - 1958] was a song written and recorded by Bobby Darin for Brunswick Records\, but as Darin was still under contract to Atlantic Records' subsidiary\, Atco\, the song was released by "The Ding Dongs". New York deejays liked the record and Atco soon discovered the deception. Brunswick was forced to turn over the masters to Atco which released the record under the name "The Rinky Dinks".  --- ABOUT THE ARTIST--- Bob Luman recieved his early musical influence in Nacogdoches\, Texas\, as his father was an amateur fiddle\, guitar and harmonica player.  In 1956\, he won a talent contest which earned him an appearance on the Louisiana Hayride. For the Hayride\, Luman formed a backup band called the Shadows. In 1957\, the band signed with Imperial Records\, where they recorded "All Night Long" and "Amarillo Blues".That same year\, the band appeared for the first time on the Town Hall Party in Los Angeles\, and appeared in the movie Carnival Rock. In 1958\, dropped by Imperial Records\, Luman signed with Capitol Records\, where he released "Try Me" and "I Know My Baby Cares." Capitol Records wanted Luman to change his name\, which he refused to do\, so he left the record label and signed with Warner Bros. Records\, recording "Class of '59" and "Loretta". In 1960\, Luman was drafted into the United States Army. It was while still in the Army that Warner Bros. Records released Luman's best-known crossover hit\, "Let's Think About Living\," a novelty song that hit #7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and #9 on the Billboard country music chart. After leaving the Army in 1962\, Luman moved to Nashville\, where he married. In 1965\, he joined the Grand Ole Opry. Luman toured frequently in the 60s and 70s\, and became popular in Las Vegas\, with an act which combined country and rockabilly. He signed with Epic Records in 1968\, and had several hits with them\, including "Still Loving You" and "Lonely Women Make Good Lovers" -his biggest country hit\, hitting #4 on the country chart. Luman's other country hits included "Ain't Got Time To Be Unhappy" (1968)\, "Ballad of Two Brothers" (with Autry Inman\, 1968)\, "When You Say Love" (1972)\, "Neither One Of Us (Wants To Be The First To Say Goodbye)" (1973)\, "Proud Of You Baby" (1975)\, and "The Pay Phone" (1977). Luman died in Nashville of pneumonia in 1978\, at the age of forty-one. After his death\, Bear Family Records released several compilations of his songs\, including More of the Rocker\, Still Rockin' and Carnival Rock. Luman is a member of both the Rockabilly Hall of Fame and the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame.  source: www.wikipedia.org COL channel name VAL AugieBurr	0

COL title VAL I've Got Work to Do COL performer VAL Maceo Parker	COL video title VAL Walker Brothers :::: Pretty Girls Everywhere. COL description VAL The Walker Brothers were an American pop group of the 1960s and 1970s\, comprising Scott Engel (eventually known professionally as Scott Walker)\, John Walker (born John Maus\, but using the name Walker since his teens)\, and Gary Leeds (eventually known as Gary Walker). After moving to Britain in 1965\, they had a number of top ten albums and singles there\, including the No. 1 chart hits "Make It Easy on Yourself" and "The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine (Anymore)\," both of which also made the US top 20.  Formed in 1964\, they adopted the 'Walker Brothers' name even though the members are all unrelated as a show business touch—"simply because we liked it." They provided a unique counterpoint to the British Invasion in that they were a group from the United States that achieved much more success in the United Kingdom than in their home country\, during the period when the popularity of British bands such as The Beatles dominated the US.

The Cat Came Back COL description VAL Now old Mr. Johnson had troubles of his own\, He had a yellow cat that wouldn't leave his home\, He tried and he tried to get that cat away\, Gave it to a man going far away.  But the cat came back\, the very next day\, The cat came back\, they thought he was a goner\, But the cat came back\, just wouldn't stay away.  Now the man around the corner swore he'd kill the cat on sight\, He loaded up his shotgun with nails and dynamites\, He waited and he waited for the cat to come around\, Ninety-seven pieces of the man is all they found.  But the cat came back\, the very next day\, The cat came back\, they thought he was a goner\, But the cat came back\, just wouldn't stay away.  Gave it to a little boy with a dollar note\, Told him for to take it up the river in a boat\, They tied a rope around its neck it must've weighed a pound\, Now they drag the river for the little boy it's drowned.  But the cat came back\, the very next day\, The cat came back\, they thought he was a goner\, But the cat came back\, just wouldn't stay away.  Gave it to man going up in a balloon\, Told him for to take it to the man on the Moon\, The balloon came down about 90 miles away\, Where he is now\, I dare not say.  But the cat came back\, the very next day\, The cat came back\, they thought he was a goner\, But the cat came back\, just wouldn't stay away.  They gave it to a man going way out west\, Told him for to take it to the one he loved the best\, First\, the train hit the curve\, then it jumped the rail\, Not a soul was left behind to tell the gruesome tale.  But the cat came back\, the very next day\, The cat came back\, they thought he was a goner\, But the cat came back\, just wouldn't stay away\, away\, away\, away.  Away across the ocean he did send the cat at last\, Vessel out alone today taking water fast\, People all began to pray the boat began to toss\, A great big gust of wind came by and every soul was lost.  But the cat came back\, the very next day\, The cat came back\, they thought he was a goner\, But the cat came back\, just wouldn't stay away.  On a telegraph wire\, sparrows sitting in a bunch\, The cat was feeling hungry\, thought she'd like them for a lunch\, Climb softly up the pole\, when she reached the top\, Put her foot in the electric wire\, which tied her in a knot.  But the cat came back\, the very next day\, The cat came back\, they thought he was a goner\, But the cat came back\, just wouldn't stay away.  Now the cat was a possessor of a family of a own\, With seven little kittens and along came a cyclone\, Blew the houses all apart and tossed the cat around\, The air was full of kittens and not a one was found.  But the cat came back\, the very next day\, The cat came back\, they thought she was a goner\, But the cat came back\, just wouldn't stay away\, away\, away\, away\, Just wouldn't stay away.

COL title VAL Never Let Me Go COL performer VAL The Van Dykes [1]	COL video title VAL Leslie West - Politician.wmv COL description VAL Leslie West - Got Blooze (2005) Guitar hero Leslie West has issued countless albums over the years\, mostly either as a member of Mountain or as a solo artist. But he has never set out to record an album comprised entirely of classic blues rockers. Then 2005's Got Blooze came along. While this sort of thing has been done by countless fellow veteran classic rock acts of late (the best-known of the bunch being Aerosmith's Honkin' on Bobo)\, it turns out to be custom-made for a player like West. Throughout the 12-track set\, West keeps things raw and gritty\, as evidenced by such standouts as the extraordinary "Third Degree" and a cover of the oft-overlooked Cream gem\, "Politician." West also surrounds himself with a fantastic rhythm section\, comprised of Vanilla Fudge's Tim Bogert on bass and session ace Aynsley Dunbar on drums (turns out the pair pulled double duty\, as they also backed ex-Ozzy Osbourne guitarist Jake E. Lee on an additional album full of covers\, Retraced). While we probably could have done without the umpteenth cover of "Baby Please Don't Go" (AC/DC\, Aerosmith\, Ted Nugent\, and countless others have played it over the years)\, overall\, Got Blooze is a welcome return for West\, and easily his strongest\, most focused work in quite some time.

COL title VAL Let It Go COL performer VAL James Bay	COL video title VAL John Fogerty - Have Thine Own Way\, Lord.wmv COL description VAL The Blue Ridge Rangers Is the first solo album by John Fogerty\, the former lead singer and lead guitarist of Creedence Clearwater Revival. Upon its initial release by Fantasy Records in 1973\, the album was credited to "The Blue Ridge Rangers" with no mention of Fogerty on the cover. Fogerty chose to do this in order to distance himself from his Creedence legacy. The LP was later reissued and credited to John Fogerty with a different cover design. The CD reissue restores the original silhouette cover photo and credits the album to Fogerty. The album is made up entirely of traditional and country covers\, and features Fogerty playing all the instruments. The album peaked at #47 on the charts. Two singles from the album became hits: "Jambalaya" which peaked at #16\, and "Hearts of Stone" which peaked at #37. In 2009\, Fogerty released a sequel to this album\, entitled The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again.  Track listing Side one 1. "Blue Ridge Mountain Blues" (Traditional) -- 2:29 2. "Somewhere Listening (For My Name)" (Archie Brownlee) -- 2:37 3. "You're the Reason" (Fred Henley\, Terry Fell\, Mildred Imes\, Bobby Edwards) - 3:12 4. "Jambalaya (On the Bayou)" (Hank Williams) -- 3:15 5. "She Thinks I Still Care" (Dickey Lee Lipscomb\, Steve Duffy) -- 2:57 6. "California Blues (Blue Yodel #4)" (Jimmie Rodgers) -- 3:04 7.

This album features the likes of Clive Langer\, Ian Broudie\, James Eller and Lee "Kix" Thompson of Madness. Bette Bright (real name Anne Martin) married Graham "Suggs" McPherson (no introduction necessary) and retired from music to start a family. Recently\, however\, she has re-emerged along with Deaf School\, playing several reunion and tribute gigs. Oh and any eagle-eyes among us will have spotted a red-wigged Bette in the Sex Pistols movie Rock 'N' Roll Swindle (check the scene where Steve Jones...soils the gold record).

COL title VAL Vehicle COL performer VAL The Links	COL video title VAL "Warren Smith ~ Rock 'n' Roll Ruby" - Sun 239 1956 COL description VAL Warren Smith - Rock n Roll Ruby on Sun 239. Hope You ENJOY!!! Warren Smith (February 7\, 1932 -- January 30\, 1980) was an American rockabilly and country music singer and guitarist. Smith was born in Humphreys County\, Mississippi to Iola and Willie Warren Smith\, who divorced when he was young. He was raised by his maternal grandparents in Louise\, Mississippi where they had a small farm and dry goods store. Smith took up the guitar to while away his evenings while in the United States Air Force stationed in San Antonio\, Texas. By the time of his discharge from the service\, he had decided to make a career of music. He moved to West Memphis\, Arkansas and auditioned\, successfully\, to play the Cotton Club\, a local hot spot. Steel guitarist Stan Kessler\, who was playing at that nightclub with the Snearly Ranch Boys\, immediately spotted Smith's potential and took him to Sun Records to audition for Sam Phillips\, with the Snearly Ranch Boys providing backup. Phillips liked what he heard\, and decided that "Rock & Roll Ruby"\, a song credited to Johnny Cash\, would be Smith's first record. (Smith later claimed that "Rock & Roll Ruby" was actually written by George Jones and sold to Cash for $40.) Smith recorded it on February 5\, 1956. Phillips\, who was hedging his bets over whether rock and roll would maintain its popularity\, released that record with a country crooner\, aptly named "I'd Rather Be Safe Than Sorry"\, on the flip side. By May 26\, "Rock & Roll Ruby" had hit No. 1 on the local pop charts. Smith's first record for Sun went on to outsell the first Sun releases by Elvis Presley\, Johnny Cash and Carl Perkins. In August 1956\, Smith went back to the Sun Records studio to record his second release\, "Ubangi Stomp". This infectious rocker had an incorrect lyric including an African chief with the syntax of a movie Indian. For the B side\, Smith recorded the classic ballad "Black Jack David". This song\, which originated in early 18th-century Britain and survived in various forms in the mountains of the American south\, may be the oldest song ever recorded by a rock and roll performer. Although a resounding artistic success\, it did not sell as well as Smith's debut. In 1957\, Smith recorded "So Long\, I'm Gone"\, a song written by Roy Orbison\, and it did become Smith's biggest hit at Sun\, peaking at No. 74 nationally (Billboard). But Sun had no cash to promote it at the same time as Sam Phillips put every dollar Sun had behind Jerry Lee Lewis' "Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin On". Although Smith continued to make rockabilly records for Sun\, including a cover version of Slim Harpo's "Got Love If Your Want It" (recorded in October 1957)\, these records did not do well commercially. Toward the end of 1958\, Smith\, seeing his future in country music\, cut a final record for Sun\, a cover version of Don Gibson's "Sweet Sweet Girl". In spite of a review in Billboard calling it "ultra commercial"\, this record also failed to sell. Like other artists such as Sonny Burgess\, Hayden Thompson\, Billy Lee Riley and Ray Harris\, chart success largely eluded him. Smith then decided to leave Sun Records.

Her style was a hybrid of Brill Building-style New York pop\, jazz\, gospel\, rhythm and blues\, show tunes\, rock and soul.  She was best known\, and enjoyed her greatest commercial success\, as a composer and lyricist rather than as a performer. Between 1968 and 1970 a number of other singers had significant hits with her songs: The 5th Dimension with "Blowing Away"\, "Wedding Bell Blues"\, "Stoned Soul Picnic"\, "Sweet Blindness"\, "Save The Country" and "Black Patch"; Blood\, Sweat & Tears and Peter\, Paul & Mary with "And When I Die"; Three Dog Night with "Eli's Coming"; and Barbra Streisand with "Stoney End"\, "Time and Love"\, and "Hands off the Man (Flim Flam Man)". Nyro's best-selling single was her recording of Carole King and Gerry Goffin's "Up on the Roof."   Lyrics:  Loving you so I was too blind to see you letting me go But now that you've set me free It's gonna take a miracle Yes\, it's gonna take a miracle To make me love someone new Cause I'm crazy for you  Oh oh\, didn't you know It wouldn't be so easy lettin' you go I could have told you that it's gonna take a miracle  oh-uh Yes\, it's gonna take a miracle To make me love someone new Cause I'm crazy for you  Oh\, tho' I know I can't forget? about you or come so? will show you how much You're turning me around\, destroying me I'll never be the same anymore  You must realize You took your love and left me Quite by surprise You can be sure that now it's gonna take a miracle Yes\, it's gonna take a miracle To make me love someone new Cause I'm crazy for you COL channel name VAL Mr.Lotsopa	0

In the prison cell I sit\, Thinking Mother dear of you\, And our bright and happy home so far away\, And the tears they fill my eyes Spite of all that I can do Though I try to cheer my comrades and be gay.  Chorus: Tramp! tramp! tramp! The boys are marching Cheer up comrades\, They will come. And beneath the starry flag We shall breathe the air again Of the free land in our own beloved home.  In the battle front we stood When their fiercest charge they made\, And they swept us off a hundred men or more; But before we reached their lines They were beaten back\, dismayed\, And we heard the cry of vict'ry o'er and o'er.  So within the prison cell We are waiting for the day That shall come to open wide the iron door; And the hollow eye grows bright And the poor heart almost gay As we think of seing home and friends once more.

COL title VAL Sospesa ad un filo COL performer VAL I Corvi	COL video title VAL Leslie West - Politician.wmv COL description VAL Leslie West - Got Blooze (2005) Guitar hero Leslie West has issued countless albums over the years\, mostly either as a member of Mountain or as a solo artist. But he has never set out to record an album comprised entirely of classic blues rockers. Then 2005's Got Blooze came along. While this sort of thing has been done by countless fellow veteran classic rock acts of late (the best-known of the bunch being Aerosmith's Honkin' on Bobo)\, it turns out to be custom-made for a player like West. Throughout the 12-track set\, West keeps things raw and gritty\, as evidenced by such standouts as the extraordinary "Third Degree" and a cover of the oft-overlooked Cream gem\, "Politician." West also surrounds himself with a fantastic rhythm section\, comprised of Vanilla Fudge's Tim Bogert on bass and session ace Aynsley Dunbar on drums (turns out the pair pulled double duty\, as they also backed ex-Ozzy Osbourne guitarist Jake E. Lee on an additional album full of covers\, Retraced). While we probably could have done without the umpteenth cover of "Baby Please Don't Go" (AC/DC\, Aerosmith\, Ted Nugent\, and countless others have played it over the years)\, overall\, Got Blooze is a welcome return for West\, and easily his strongest\, most focused work in quite some time.

COL title VAL Norge i rødt\, hvitt og blått COL performer VAL Jens Book-Jenssen m/ Carsten Kloumans kor og orkester	COL video title VAL Uriah Heep - Lady in Black COL description VAL http://www.discogs.com/artist/Uriah+Heep http://www.myspace.com/uriaheep  Uriah Heep's by-the-books progressive heavy metal made the British band one of the most popular hard rock groups of the early '70s. Formed by vocalist David Byron and guitarist Mick Box in the late '60s\, the group went through an astonishing number of members over the next two decades — nearly 30 different musicians passed through the band over the years. Byron and Box were members of the mid-'60s rock band called the Stalkers; once that band broke up\, the duo formed another group called Spice. Spice would eventually turn into Uriah Heep in the late '60s\, once Ken Hensley (guitar\, keyboards\, vocals) and bassist Paul Newton joined the pair. Former Spice drummer Alex Napier was the band's drummer for a brief time; he was quickly replaced by Nigel Olsson. Uriah Heep released their debut album Very 'eavy...Very 'umble (called Uriah Heep in the U.S.) in 1970. After its release\, Keith Baker became the group's drummer; he recorded Salisbury\, the group's second album\, before deciding he couldn't keep up with the band's extensive touring and was replaced by Ian Clarke. Salisbury\, featuring a 16-minute title track recorded with a 26-piece orchestra\, showcased the band's more progressive tendencies. Later that year\, Ian Clarke was replaced by Lee Kerslake and Mark Clarke replaced Newton; Mark Clarke quickly left the band and Gary Thain became the group's bassist. This lineup of Uriah Heep was its most stable and popular; beginning with 1972's Demons and Wizards\, they released five albums between 1972 and 1975. After 1975\, the band's popularity began to slip. Byron left the band in 1977 and was replaced by John Lawton\, yet the group's fortunes kept declining right into the early '80s. However\, Uriah Heep soldiered on\, continuing to release albums into the '90s and 2000s. The album roster included Different World (1994)\, Sea of Light (1995)\, Sonic Origami (1998)\, and Spellbinder (1999). COL channel name VAL TheDeZyx	0

I lay there in the sun And felt it caressing my face As I fell asleep And dreamed. I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie And that I was the star of the movie. This really blew my mind\, The fact that me\, An overfed\, long-haired\, leaping gnome\, Should be the star of a Hollywood movie. Hmm\, but there I was. I was taken to a place\, The hall of the mountain king. I stood high upon a mountain top\, Naked to the world\, In front of every kind of girl. There was long ones\, tall ones\, short ones\, brown ones\, Black ones\, round ones\, big ones\, crazy ones. Out of the middle Came a lady. She whispered in my ear Something crazy. She said\, Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl." I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back As she disappeared\, But soon she returned. In her hand was a bottle of wine\, In the other\, a glass. She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass And raised it to her lips And\, just before she drank it\, She said\, Take the wine\, take that girl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl." Take that pearl\, yeah. It's on girl\, all you gotta do is spill that wine\, spill that wine. Let me feel\, let me feel fine\, yeah\, yeah. Spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, take that pearl.

Dette er en sang som jeg liker veldig godt og som betyr veldig mye for meg. ___________________________________  Ja fysst så vil je nevne min stilling og min stæinn\, je står og svarver hatter i Salomo sitt læinn. Sjøl bær je navnet Jørgen\, så skilnaden er stor\, men både je og Salomo kom nakne tel vår jord.  Refr.:  Sola skin på deg så skuggen fell på meg men graset er grønt for æille.  Når liljene på marken i fager blomstring står\, og alle himlens fugler sin glade trille slår\, je nynne såmmå strofa i hattemakergrenn\, og morgendagen\, Salomo\, hva vet vel vi om den?  Refr.  Har Salomo sitt måltid med vin og fylte fat\, je sug på harde skorper og kæille det for mat\, men det vi gir ifrå øss di vi i lønndom går blir gras til hyrdens hvite lam og Sarons sorte får.  Refr.  Når dronningen av Saba gjør Salomo visitt\, je ser a "Lea Lettvint" og hu har tenkt seg hit. Om leiet blir forskjellig frå silkeseng tel strå\, vi går mot såmmå paradis og hører harper slå.  Refr.  Når sola synk og dale bak slottets tårn og tind\, så kjæm den mørke natta med drøm og tankespinn\, der blir je sjøl Kong Salomo og hæin blir kænskje den som står og svarver hatter uti hattemakergrenn.

I lay there in the sun And felt it caressing my face As I fell asleep And dreamed. I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie And that I was the star of the movie. This really blew my mind\, The fact that me\, An overfed\, long-haired\, leaping gnome\, Should be the star of a Hollywood movie. Hmm\, but there I was. I was taken to a place\, The hall of the mountain king. I stood high upon a mountain top\, Naked to the world\, In front of every kind of girl. There was long ones\, tall ones\, short ones\, brown ones\, Black ones\, round ones\, big ones\, crazy ones. Out of the middle Came a lady. She whispered in my ear Something crazy. She said\, Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl." I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back As she disappeared\, But soon she returned. In her hand was a bottle of wine\, In the other\, a glass. She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass And raised it to her lips And\, just before she drank it\, She said\, Take the wine\, take that girl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl." Take that pearl\, yeah. It's on girl\, all you gotta do is spill that wine\, spill that wine. Let me feel\, let me feel fine\, yeah\, yeah. Spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, take that pearl.

COL title VAL I Never Go Around Mirrors COL performer VAL Keith Whitley	COL video title VAL The Newbeats -_I'm Blue - (The Gong-Gong)_1964 Hickory.wmv COL description VAL Texan Larry Henley first performed with the Dean and Marc Combo in 1962. Business links with Nashville-based Hickory Records owner Wesley Rose rapidly led to solo releases by Larry Henley and also\, Dean and Marc.  In June 1964\, Larry\, Dean and Marc got together and cut an unusual\, falsetto-driven demo of the Everly Brothers' "Bye Bye Love." The song's composer\, Bouldleaux Bryant\, heard the dazzling demo and immediately convinced Wesley Rose to sign the trio to a separate\, (third!) recording contract. Fred Foster\, owner of Monument Records\, suggested the "Newbeats" name.  Holland Picture Sleeve - Bye Bye Love was never released on 45 in the USA  "Bye Bye Love\," "Break Away (From That Boy)" (later a #34 hit in Cash Box) and the Chevrolet Corvair tune "Tough Little Buggy" were duly recorded on June 28\, 1964. At the last minute Rose's brother-in-law suggested a song called "Bread And Butter." Dean Mathis created a new\, authoritative arrangement on the spot\, showcasing Larry Henley's scorching\, gospel-influenced falsetto.  When released\, "Bread And Butter" was buried on the 'B' side of "Tough Little Buggy." But DJs at Detroit's WKNR radio flipped the single and "Bread And Butter" blasted onto the WKNR survey the week of July 16\, 1964\, soon peaking at #1.  Nationally "Bread And Butter" shot to #2 and attained Gold sales.  The Newbeats' jaw-dropping national TV debut took place Wednesday\, September 30\, 1964 on ABC-TV's 'Shindig.'  An appearance on 'American Bandstand' came next. The group then stormed Europe via Holland's 'Grand Gala du Disque 1964\,' a widely seen\, four hour television spectacular.   Billboard September 12\, 1964  In addition to "A Patent On Love" (originally intended for Joey "Midnight Mary" Powers) and "Pink Dally Rue" (later recorded by Jimmy Elledge and Robin Wilson)\, the 'Bread & Butter' album included "Thou Shalt Not Steal\," penned by longtime Hickory confederate John D. Loudermilk ("Norman\," "Talk Back Trembling Lips"). Dick and Deedee recognized the potential of the album cut and soon lodged a version of "Thou Shalt Not Steal" at #13 on the charts (Warner single 5482). Another Loudermilk tune\, the #16 "Everything's Alright\," became the Newbeats' follow-up to "Bread And Butter."  From January 22 through February 13\, 1965\, the Newbeats toured Australia and New Zealand with the Rolling Stones\, Roy Orbison and Rolf Harris. During the tour\, Larry Henley became very close to Mick Jagger and the two even planned an album project. Hickory owner Wesley Rose managed tour headliner Roy Orbison. The Newbeats later recorded Orbison's "Oh\, Pretty Woman" and "Lookin' For Love."  "(The Bees Are For The Birds) The Birds Are For The Bees\," was written by the composers of "Bread And Butter\," Larry Parks and Jay Turnbow\, with help from Bob Finnicum. While "Bread And Butter" had referred to sex in sympathetic gastronomic terms\, the refreshingly naïve "Birds Are For The Bees" found Larry Henley (27)\, Dean Mathis (28) and Marc Mathis (25) innocently claiming\, "Grown-ups tell me the birds and the bees do other things than live in trees" and concluding\, to the astonishment of angst-ridden teen listeners\, "I don't care if they can fly it's got nothing to do with you and I."  Issued with two different front covers\, the April 1965 album 'Big Beat Sounds' showcased the Newbeats' most recent single sides. The aforementioned Larry Parks\, Jay Turnbow and Bob Finnicum contributed three additional quirky tunes to the album. 'Big Beat Sounds' also contained valuable material such as Goffin and King's lead-off cut "I Can't Hear You No More" and Keith Colley and Nancie Mantz's closer "Human Kindness."  Colley and Mantz had penned tunes for Rick Nelson ("That's All She Wrote")\, Bobby Bare ("Talk Me Some Sense") and Skeeter Davis ("Ladder Of Success"). Nanci Mantz later co-wrote several songs for the Electric Prunes\, including "I Had Too Much To Dream (Last Night)."  The driving "Little Child" was released as a single in the summer of 1965. Oddly\, it did not drive the national charts wild. But the group's publicity blitz continued unabated with appearances on ABC-TV's 'Where The Action Is' on July 20 and August 25\, 1965.  The Newbeats scored a major comeback with the September 1965 single\, "Run\, Baby Run." The #12 hit boasted exquisite vocal harmonies and a stomping Motown beat. And "Run\, Baby Run" had legs; in 1971 it went Top Ten in England. Roy Orbison and the Tremelos even cut versions of the influential tune.  November 1965 saw 'Run\, Baby Run\,' the Newbeats' third and final Hickory album. Remakes of the Isley Brothers' "This Old Heart" and the Supremes' "Come See About Me" boldly demonstrated the influence of Motown soul while covers of "Help" and "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction" recognized the Beatles and Rolling Stones.

COL title VAL Come Closer to Me COL performer VAL Jane Morgan	COL video title VAL Macabre - Morbid Campfire Songs - 4. The Cat Came Back COL description VAL Now old Mr. Johnson had troubles of his own\, He had a yellow cat that wouldn't leave his home\, He tried and he tried to get that cat away\, Gave it to a man going far away.  But the cat came back\, the very next day\, The cat came back\, they thought he was a goner\, But the cat came back\, just wouldn't stay away.  Now the man around the corner swore he'd kill the cat on sight\, He loaded up his shotgun with nails and dynamites\, He waited and he waited for the cat to come around\, Ninety-seven pieces of the man is all they found.  But the cat came back\, the very next day\, The cat came back\, they thought he was a goner\, But the cat came back\, just wouldn't stay away.  Gave it to a little boy with a dollar note\, Told him for to take it up the river in a boat\, They tied a rope around its neck it must've weighed a pound\, Now they drag the river for the little boy it's drowned.  But the cat came back\, the very next day\, The cat came back\, they thought he was a goner\, But the cat came back\, just wouldn't stay away.  Gave it to man going up in a balloon\, Told him for to take it to the man on the Moon\, The balloon came down about 90 miles away\, Where he is now\, I dare not say.  But the cat came back\, the very next day\, The cat came back\, they thought he was a goner\, But the cat came back\, just wouldn't stay away.  They gave it to a man going way out west\, Told him for to take it to the one he loved the best\, First\, the train hit the curve\, then it jumped the rail\, Not a soul was left behind to tell the gruesome tale.  But the cat came back\, the very next day\, The cat came back\, they thought he was a goner\, But the cat came back\, just wouldn't stay away\, away\, away\, away.  Away across the ocean he did send the cat at last\, Vessel out alone today taking water fast\, People all began to pray the boat began to toss\, A great big gust of wind came by and every soul was lost.  But the cat came back\, the very next day\, The cat came back\, they thought he was a goner\, But the cat came back\, just wouldn't stay away.  On a telegraph wire\, sparrows sitting in a bunch\, The cat was feeling hungry\, thought she'd like them for a lunch\, Climb softly up the pole\, when she reached the top\, Put her foot in the electric wire\, which tied her in a knot.  But the cat came back\, the very next day\, The cat came back\, they thought he was a goner\, But the cat came back\, just wouldn't stay away.  Now the cat was a possessor of a family of a own\, With seven little kittens and along came a cyclone\, Blew the houses all apart and tossed the cat around\, The air was full of kittens and not a one was found.  But the cat came back\, the very next day\, The cat came back\, they thought she was a goner\, But the cat came back\, just wouldn't stay away\, away\, away\, away\, Just wouldn't stay away.

Lyrics:  Southern nights Have you ever felt a southern night? Free as a breeze Not to mention the trees Whistling tunes that you know and love so  Southern nights Just as good even when closed your eyes I apologize to anyone who can truly say That he has found a better way  Feel so good Feel so good It's frigth'ning Wish I could\, Stop this world from fighting. La da da da da da la da da da da da da da da  Southern skies Have you ever noticed southern skies? It's precious beauty lies just beyond the eye. It goes running through your soul Like the stories told of old  Old man He and his dog that walked the old land Ev'ry flower touched his cold hand As he slowly walked by Weeping willows Would cry for joy Joy  Mysteries Like this and many others in the trees Blow in the night In the southern skies.  Southern nights They feel so good it's fright'ning... Wish I could stop this world from fighting La da da da da da la da da da da da COL channel name VAL Fernando Vieira	0
COL title VAL Aie confiance COL performer VAL Roger Carel	COL video title VAL Hello Stranger - The Supremes & The Four Tops COL description VAL Here is another outstanding cover from the third duet album from The Supremes & The Four Tops entitled "Dynamite" from 1971.  Aside from Barbara Lewis' 1963 original\, I think this version is the best of all the covers ever done of the song. It is musical perfection.  Written by: Barbara Lewis Produced by: Bobby Taylor and Frank Wilson Track recorded: May 3\, 1971 Additional overdubs\, strings and horn sessions recorded in Los Angeles: Dates unknown Levi Stubbs lead vocal recorded: June 5\, 1971 & August 17\, 1971 Four Tops background vocals recorded: June 9\, 1971 Jean Terrell lead vocal recorded: June 10\, 1971 Supremes background vocals recorded: June 24\, 1971  This version is the best song on the entire LP and one of the best duets the groups did together over the three albums. Motown was foolish not to release this as a single. It screams hit and would have been one had Motown promoted it\, but at the time The Supremes and The Four Tops were no longer Motown's top priority. Nonetheless\, it still remains an incredible cover.  ****No copyright infringement intended**** COL channel name VAL MotownConnoisseur30	0

COL title VAL Bessie's Blues COL performer VAL The Baron Von Ohlen Quartet	COL video title VAL "Warren Smith ~ Rock 'n' Roll Ruby" - Sun 239 1956 COL description VAL Warren Smith - Rock n Roll Ruby on Sun 239. Hope You ENJOY!!! Warren Smith (February 7\, 1932 -- January 30\, 1980) was an American rockabilly and country music singer and guitarist. Smith was born in Humphreys County\, Mississippi to Iola and Willie Warren Smith\, who divorced when he was young. He was raised by his maternal grandparents in Louise\, Mississippi where they had a small farm and dry goods store. Smith took up the guitar to while away his evenings while in the United States Air Force stationed in San Antonio\, Texas. By the time of his discharge from the service\, he had decided to make a career of music. He moved to West Memphis\, Arkansas and auditioned\, successfully\, to play the Cotton Club\, a local hot spot. Steel guitarist Stan Kessler\, who was playing at that nightclub with the Snearly Ranch Boys\, immediately spotted Smith's potential and took him to Sun Records to audition for Sam Phillips\, with the Snearly Ranch Boys providing backup. Phillips liked what he heard\, and decided that "Rock & Roll Ruby"\, a song credited to Johnny Cash\, would be Smith's first record. (Smith later claimed that "Rock & Roll Ruby" was actually written by George Jones and sold to Cash for $40.) Smith recorded it on February 5\, 1956. Phillips\, who was hedging his bets over whether rock and roll would maintain its popularity\, released that record with a country crooner\, aptly named "I'd Rather Be Safe Than Sorry"\, on the flip side. By May 26\, "Rock & Roll Ruby" had hit No. 1 on the local pop charts. Smith's first record for Sun went on to outsell the first Sun releases by Elvis Presley\, Johnny Cash and Carl Perkins. In August 1956\, Smith went back to the Sun Records studio to record his second release\, "Ubangi Stomp". This infectious rocker had an incorrect lyric including an African chief with the syntax of a movie Indian. For the B side\, Smith recorded the classic ballad "Black Jack David". This song\, which originated in early 18th-century Britain and survived in various forms in the mountains of the American south\, may be the oldest song ever recorded by a rock and roll performer. Although a resounding artistic success\, it did not sell as well as Smith's debut. In 1957\, Smith recorded "So Long\, I'm Gone"\, a song written by Roy Orbison\, and it did become Smith's biggest hit at Sun\, peaking at No. 74 nationally (Billboard). But Sun had no cash to promote it at the same time as Sam Phillips put every dollar Sun had behind Jerry Lee Lewis' "Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin On". Although Smith continued to make rockabilly records for Sun\, including a cover version of Slim Harpo's "Got Love If Your Want It" (recorded in October 1957)\, these records did not do well commercially. Toward the end of 1958\, Smith\, seeing his future in country music\, cut a final record for Sun\, a cover version of Don Gibson's "Sweet Sweet Girl". In spite of a review in Billboard calling it "ultra commercial"\, this record also failed to sell. Like other artists such as Sonny Burgess\, Hayden Thompson\, Billy Lee Riley and Ray Harris\, chart success largely eluded him. Smith then decided to leave Sun Records.

Tindley was born in 1851 and died in 1936. He wrote this number in 1905 as "We"ll Understand It Better By and By." He might have recorded the number himself\, but this can't be confirmed. Tindley also wrote the song "I'll Overcome Some Day\," which later became know as "We Shall Overcome." Furthermore\, he wrote the gospel number "Stand By Me." Many sources imply that this is the song with which Ben E. King had a hit in the 1960s\, but that was a different number. However\, Elvis also recorded Tindley's "Stand By Me" for his own "How Great Thou Art" gospel collection. Brothers Frank and James McCravy from Laurens\, South Carolina\, recorded the number as "We'll Understand It Better Bye and Bye" (note the added "e"s on the words "By") in New York in February 1925\, for release on Okeh 40319. This was the McCravy's first recording session\, but they went on to record hundreds of tracks\, often using different names\, such as The Lonesome Pine Twins\, The Austin Brothers\, Al and Joe Blackburn\, Cox and Campbell\, and The Mack Brothers. They ended their recording career in 1935\, by which time they had recorded "We'll Understand It Better Bye and Bye" on at least two more occasions.

COL title VAL The Secret o' Life COL performer VAL Nancy LaMott	COL video title VAL Drop Down Mama - "Sleepy" John Estes. COL description VAL Here's a record I bought in the 1950's when going through my 'duffel coat\, roll-neck sweater\, corduroy trousers and sandals' phase. (A real "mouldy fig"\, as the sharp suited 'modern' jazz fans called us 'trad' fans.) It is one of the recordings sponsored by "The Jazz Appreciation Society" and features Sleepy John in typical form and accompanied by Hammie Nixon on harmonica. Born John Adam Estes\, to a sharecropper family in Ripley Tennessee on the 25th. Jan. 1904\, his life was complicated from the start. One of a family of ten\, at the age of six he lost his right eye in a baseball accident. As his father was a guitarist\, he grew up with similar interests and made himself cigar-box guitars to play from the early days. He went totally blind in 1950\, and had gained the sobriquet "sleepy" from a chronic blood pressure disorder which led to fits of narcolepsy\, which caused him to drop off to sleep without warning\, sometimes standing up! He was "rediscovered" during the blues revival in 1962\, after a long and varied career through the 1920's and 30's. He died on the 5th. June 1977 COL channel name VAL Clive Dellino	0

Aside from Barbara Lewis' 1963 original\, I think this version is the best of all the covers ever done of the song. It is musical perfection.  Written by: Barbara Lewis Produced by: Bobby Taylor and Frank Wilson Track recorded: May 3\, 1971 Additional overdubs\, strings and horn sessions recorded in Los Angeles: Dates unknown Levi Stubbs lead vocal recorded: June 5\, 1971 & August 17\, 1971 Four Tops background vocals recorded: June 9\, 1971 Jean Terrell lead vocal recorded: June 10\, 1971 Supremes background vocals recorded: June 24\, 1971  This version is the best song on the entire LP and one of the best duets the groups did together over the three albums. Motown was foolish not to release this as a single. It screams hit and would have been one had Motown promoted it\, but at the time The Supremes and The Four Tops were no longer Motown's top priority. Nonetheless\, it still remains an incredible cover.  ****No copyright infringement intended**** COL channel name VAL MotownConnoisseur30	0

COL title VAL Sabbath Bloody Sabbath COL performer VAL Iron Horse [1]	COL video title VAL Bessie Jones and Georgia Sea Island Singers - O Death COL description VAL In voudun there are gods and demigods of death and of the cemetery who come to the dancing ground and possess some of their worshipers; now vehicles through which the deities can communicate with mortals\, the possessed advise\, gossip\, eat\, dance\, and socialize with the congregants. Thus Bessie Jones's dramatic dialogue between Death and the reluctant sinner might just as well have its roots in an African tradition as in the popular religious poems and dramas of medieval Europe in which death was so frequently personified. Chorus O Death in the mornin'\, (3 times) Spare me over another year. Well\, Death walked up into the sinner's gaze\, Says\, "B'lieve you have waited now a little too late\, Your fever now is one hundred and two\, Have a narrow chance if you ever pull through." (Chorus) He cried\, "O Death\," Cryin'\, "O Death in the mornin'\, O Death\, Death\, spare me over in another year. Hey\, what is this I see\, Cold\, icy hands all over me? You say\, "I am Death\, no one can excel\, I span the doors of Death and Hell." (Chorus) 11 "No\, you heard God's people sing and pray\, You would not heed\, you just walked away\, You would not even bend your knee\, Now you got to come and go with me. (Chorus) "Well\, I'm gon' fix your feet so you cannot walk\, 'M fix your tongue where you cannot talk\, Close your eyes and you cannot see\, And you got to come and go with me." (Chorus) "Well\, Death\, consider my age\, And do not take me in this stage\, Because all of my wealth is at your command\, If you'll just move your cold\, icy hand." (Chorus) He cried\, "No no\, O Death in the mornin'\, No no\, Lord\, spare me over in another year."  - Alan Lomax COL channel name VAL TheBWJohnson	0

Fools Fall In Love  ------------------------  "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" is a song by American punk rock band Green Day. It was released as the second single from their seventh album\, American Idiot. The song was written by Green Day\, with lyrics by lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong. The single peaked at number two in the United States\, making it Green Day's most successful song.  Influences and covers  Noel Gallagher of Oasis criticized Green Day in late 2006\, saying\, "They should have the decency to wait until I am dead [before stealing my songs]. I\, at least\, pay the people I steal from that courtesy"\, referencing the fact that "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" uses the same chord progression as Oasis's hit single "Wonderwall". Gallagher's reaction may have partly been due to the emergence of "Boulevard of Broken Songs"\, a popular mash-up mixed by San Francisco DJ and producer Party Ben in late 2004. The mix consisted of elements from "Boulevard of Broken Dreams"\, "Wonderwall"\, Travis' "Writing to Reach You" and Eminem's "Sing for the Moment"\, which itself has samples from Aerosmith's "Dream On" (another remix by Party Ben featured this\, "Wonderwall" and Kanye West's "Flashing Lights"). This song was covered by Japanese-American singer Hikaru Utada acoustically with a guitar during an internet broadcast in December 2005; a video of it can be found. "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" is sung first and then fades into "Passion" (After the Battle version) from the Kingdom Hearts II original soundtrack. "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" is also featured in the movie trailer of Lords of Dogtown (2005)\, starring Heath Ledger\, Emile Hirsch and John Robinson. Billie Joe Armstrong wrote the song while he was in his son Joey's bedroom.[citation needed] In the 2005 VH1 Storytellers program featuring Green Day\, Billie Joe Armstrong stated that the title of the song was "nicked" from the famous Gottfried Helnwein painting of the same title\, which features James Dean. Four earlier songs also have the same title: an old Harry Warren song\, a Hanoi Rocks song\, a Marianne Faithfull song\, and song by Brian Setzer from his 1986 album The Knife Feels Like Justice Lyrics from the song bear some resemblance to the Pinhead Gunpowder song "I Walk Alone"\, a band in which Billie Joe Armstrong also sings. It appeared on their 1997 album\, Goodbye Ellston Avenue. The song also shares some lyrics with the Whitesnake song "Here I Go Again"\, the words "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" can be found in the lyrics of the Elvis Costello song "Brilliant Mistake"\, the Allman Brothers Band song "End of the Line"\, the Deadsy song "The Key to Gramercy Park"\, and The Ataris song "Road Signs and Rock Songs". The phrase "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" also appears in punk/new wave band Blondie's 1982 minor UK-hit single Island of Lost Souls. A live version of the song can be found on Bullet in a Bible\, a live album of Green Day performing at the Milton Keynes National Bowl. Bluegrass band Cornbread Red did a cover of the song on a tribute album to Green Day Pickin' on Green Day\, while the German choir Gregorian did a cover\, on their Masters of Chant Chapter V album\, in the style of a Gregorian Chant. Mark Mallman covered this song on his MP3-only compilation release Outtakes Vol 1. The song is also featured in Green Day's musical American Idiot\, sung on the cast recording by John Gallagher Jr.\, Rebecca Naomi Jones\, and the rest of the company.

The english lyrics (well known by the classic Leonard Cohen cover) were written by Hy Zaret.  Bertrand Cantat of Noir Desir provides some french vocals...  LYRICS When they poured across the border I was cautioned to surrender\, this I could not do; I took my gun and vanished.  I have changed my name so often\, I've lost my wife and children but I have many friends\, and some of them are with me.  An old woman gave us shelter\, Kept us hidden in the garret\, then the soldiers came; she died without a whisper.  There were three of us this morning I'm the only one this evening but I must go on; the frontiers are my prison.  Oh\, the wind\, the wind is blowing\, through the graves the wind is blowing\, freedom soon will come; then we'll come from the shadows.  Les Allemands étaient chez moi\, ils me dirent\, "Résigne toi\," mais je n'ai pas peur; j'ai repris mon âme.  (The Germans were at my home They said\, "Sign yourself\," But I am not afraid I have retaken my soul.)  J'ai changé cent fois de nom\, j'ai perdu femme et enfants mais j'ai tant d'amis; j'ai la France entière.  (I've changed names a hundred times I have lost wife and children But I have so many friends I have all of France)  Un vieil homme dans un grenier pour la nuit nous a caché\, les Allemands l'ont pris; il est mort sans surprise.  (An old man\, in an attic Hid us for the night The Germans captured him He died without surprise.)  Oh\, the wind\, the wind is blowing\, through the graves the wind is blowing\, freedom soon will come; then we'll come from the shadows. COL channel name VAL TinderNikos	0

COL title VAL Boulevard of Broken Dreams COL performer VAL Boppin' B	COL video title VAL Bull Doze Blues COL description VAL One of Henry Thomas' most renowned recording which was covered to great acclaim in the 1960's by Blues Rock band Canned Heat. Henry Thomas was more a Songster than a Blues musician who played his own reworks of traditionals and standards alike with the unique touch of the Quills which he plays along with the Guitar in a style which appears to be completely individual for Thomas as a Musician.  Lyrics from Weeniepedia  Bull Doze Blues - Henry Thomas  I'm going away\, babe\, and it won't be long I'm going away and it won't be long I'm going away and it won't be long  Just as sure as that train leaves out of that Mobile yard Just as sure as that train leaves out of that Mobile yard Just as sure as that train leaves out of that Mobile yard  Come shake your hand\, tell your papa goodbye Come shake your hand\, tell your papa goodbye Come shake your hand\, tell your papa goodbye  I'm going back to Tennessee I'm going back to Memphis\, Tennessee I'm going back\, Memphis\, Tennessee  I'm going where I never get bulldozed I'm going where I never get the bulldoze I'm going where I never get bulldozed  If you don't believe I'm sinking\, look what a hole I'm in If you don't believe I'm sinking\, look what a hole I'm in If you don't believe I'm sinking\, look what a fool I've been.

COL title VAL Better Off with the Blues COL performer VAL Zora Young	COL video title VAL Affirmation - Jose Feliciano Original 1975 (also by Nujabes Counting Stars cover by George Benson) COL description VAL https://www.facebook.com/Jose-Feliciano-Fan-Area-1387556718159682  Affirmation Instrumental by Jose Feliciano recorded in his 1975 RCA album "Just Wann Rock'n'Roll"  FINALLY in CD !!!  in a new FANTASTIC COMPILATION for Jose Feliciano called "NO JIVE"...  (don't confuse  with many other compilations\, they has another 1996 re-recorded version)  NO JIVE is ABSOLUTELY THE BEST COMPILATION ABOUT JOSE FELICIANO 2 CD with his hit and many rarities never released before and many intrumentals  The song is also famous in the cover by George Benson in his hit album "Breezin" from 1976 and recently sampled by DJ Nujabes in Counting Stars part of the Samurai Champloo line up as "Shino's Theme" Video isn't of the.... Vinyl Version!!  here the story "How George Benson covered Affirmation by Jose Feliciano" by his producer LiPuma  A review by '70s for Breezin LP  Though Side One of Breezin' had the hits\, Side Two was a creamy\, seamless masterpiece unto itself. It unfolded with "Affirmation\," a song composed by Jose Feliciano\, the international superstar singer/guitarist/composer who had recorded it on his album\, Just Wanna Rock 'N' Roll (RCA)\, from the fall of '75. "Affirmation" was the sole instrumental on that Feliciano LP\, providing the blind Puerto Rican wunderkind a golden opportunity to showcase his skills on acoustic Spanish guitar\, electric rhythm guitar (with a wah-wah effect)\, electric bass\, congas and as a string arranger! LiPuma was enchanted with the melody of Feliciano's relatively brief (3:33) recording. When material was being prepared for Breezin'\, he presented it to Benson\, who liked it immediately. The band worked up an arrangement that loosened and elongated the vibe of the original. Like Feliciano's version\, George begins "Affirmation" alone\, caressing an introduction of choice notes and a smooth rendering of its signature run down the frets. But when the rhythm section eases in\, led by MacDonald's congas\, the groove is more relaxed and funky in a way that is quite different from Feliciano's more insistent arrangement\, which throbbed with forthright Latin pride. Where Feliciano had his rhythm section drop out for the soaring bridge\, Benson's band rides it like the wind\, drummer Mason liberating the rhythm by opening up on his cymbals. Benson tickles the strings with a tasty solo that leads into the killer breakdown section\, with Upchurch dipping into his effects bag. And then\, in what has to be one of the all-time classiest hand-offs in music\, Benson makes way for Dalto's wistful electric piano (complete with soulful little comps) before Benson takes it home\, getting in a few final signature licks. Benson's "Affirmation" is seven minutes of masterful musical heaven. http://www.fantasticfeliciano.too.it/ COL channel name VAL Thevolumex	0

It was the 3rd track on her 2001 CD Single\, released in Australia by rooArt Records\, cat. # 74321848392. The other two tracks\, "Sleep" and "All I Want" were also on her album "The Other Side"\, but this track was an orphan...to my knowledge\, this single is the only place it was ever issued.  It is a gentle\, acoustic-pop remake of the Badfinger classic.  Prior to this release\, Shanley was considered a country artist\, but\, this album had much more of a Pop flavour\, which I guess accounts for the album title\, "The Other Side". As part of the new image\, she also dropped the 'Del" from her name...on this release\, she is simply called "Shanley".  *** If you like my channel\, why not SUBSCRIBE?

Mastered at Project One Mastering.  ------------------------  "The One I Love" is a song by American rock band R.E.M.. It was released on the band's fifth full-length studio album\, Document\, and also as a 7" vinyl single in 1987. The song was their first hit single\, reaching #9 in the US Billboard Hot 100\, #14 in Canada\, and later reached #16 in the UK singles chart on its UK release (1991).  The song was included in Activision's Guitar Hero World Tour and is in Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades.  The accompanying video's director was artist Robert Longo.  The director of photography was Alton Brown\, who later became a Food Network chef.  In March 2005\, Q magazine placed "The One I Love" at number 57 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks.  The song is included on R.E.M. Live.  Lyrics and meaning  Many listeners who misunderstand the song's meaning have made the song a popular radio dedication to loved ones\, relying on the main lyric\, "This one goes out to the one I love."  However\, they missed an ensuing line: "A simple prop to occupy my time"; the song was not particularly a love song.  Stipe related in 1987 to Rolling Stone\, "I've always left myself pretty open to interpretation. It's probably better that they just think it's a love song at this point."  However\, in an interview in the January 1988 issue of Musician magazine he said that the song was "incredibly violent" and "It's very clear that it's about using people over and over again".  The song contains only three verses\, which are all near identical\, with small variations each repeat of the verse. (For example "A simple prop to occupy my time"\, "Another prop has occupied my time"). The chorus consists of just the word "fire"\, repeated (with the backing vocal of "She's coming down on her own now/Coming down on her own"\, sung by Mike Mills).  Cover versions  Bush Sufjan Stevens Massacre and many more. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

COL title VAL Joan of Arc COL performer VAL Anna Calvi	COL video title VAL Joan of Arc (Leonard Cohen) - Allison Crowe w. lyrics COL description VAL On her debut album "secrets" Allison Crowe covers this Leonard Cohen song. Her voice and piano is accompanied by Jo Lundstrom (Rosehip Jam\, Black Velvet Band) on accordion. Crowe engineered the recording\, with production by Rainer Willeke (of Victoria\, B.C.'s Raindog Studios).  http://music.allisoncrowe.com/track/joan-of-arc  The photo of Allison Crowe is by Billie Woods.  MOJO magazine's December '08 issue paid tribute to "Rock's Greatest Poet" Leonard Cohen with a celebration of his "deep and moving music". Of Allison Crowe's contribution of "Joan of Arc" to its 'All Star Tribute"\, (featuring Judy Collins\, Nick Cave\, Katie Melua\, Martha Wainwright\, Dion and others)\, a cover-mount CD titled "Cohen Covered"\, MOJO says: "Once famously described by the Vancouver Courier as possessing a style akin to 'Elton John meets Edith Piaf'\, the Canadian singer-songwriter Allison Crowe is renowned for her ability to blend control and melodrama. Certainly she does so on this spirited cover of Cohen's 'Songs of Love and Hate' classic\, a track which also powerfully showcases her considerable talent as a fine interpreter of song."  "Any album that features a track from Leonard Cohen is certainly heading in the right direction. But when it is covered so beautifully\, it makes you realise what an amazing lyricist Leonard Cohen is. Joan of Arc is the Cohen song covered on this album and it's certainly in my top 10 of Cohen covers. It's also my favorite track on (Secrets)" ~ Colin Meeks\, indielaunchpad.com (USA)  Joan of Arc  Words & Music by Leonard Cohen As performed by Allison Crowe  Now the flames they followed Joan of Arc as she came riding through the dark; no moon to keep her armour bright\, no man to get her through this dark and smoky night.   She said\, "I'm tired of the war\, I want the kind of work I had before\, A wedding dress or something white to wear upon my swollen appetite."  Well\, I'm glad to hear you talk this way\, I've watched you riding every day and there is something in me that yearns to win such a cold\, such a lonesome heroine.  "And who are you?" she sternly spoke to the one beneath the smoke. "Why\, I'm fire\," he replied\, "And I love your solitude\, I love your pride."  "Well\, then\, fire make your body cold\, I'm going to give you mine to hold." And saying this she climbed inside to be his one\, to be his only bride.  Then deep into his fiery heart he took the dust of Joan of Arc\, and high above all these wedding guests he hung the ashes of her lovely wedding dress.  It was deep into his fiery heart he took the dust of Joan of Arc\, and then she clearly understood if he was fire\, oh\, she must be wood.  I saw her wince\, I saw her cry\, I saw the glory in her eye. Myself I long for love and light\, but must it come so cruel\,  must it be so bright? COL channel name VAL Allison Crowe	1

COL title VAL Romeo and Juliet COL performer VAL Joe Goldmark	COL video title VAL Staccatos - Just like Romeo and Juliet COL description VAL The Staccatos are a South African band formed in November 1961 by Brian Le Gassick. The original line-up consisted of Brian le Gassick – lead vocals\, guitar\, John Leach – lead guitar\, Willie van der Walt – bass and Ian Miller – drums. In 1962 Leach and van der Walt were replaced by Richard Crouse – guitar\, Jimmy Routledge – bass and Billy Andrews – vocals\, harmonica (Billy later became one half of the duo the “Dream Merchants” with Billy Forrest). In 1964 the Staccatos won the Transvaal Merseyside Contest\, which included a recording contract with EMI. They supported Peter and Gordon on their tour of South Africa in 1965.  In 1966 Steve Lonsdale took over the lead vocals\, and Richard Crouse married Wanda Arletti who joined the group for a tour of Zambia. In 1967 Eddie Boyle – bass\, and Ronnie Cline – organ\, joined the group. In 1968 Billy Forrest approached the group to record “Cry to me” for the film “Katrina”. This song became their biggest hit\, reaching number 1 on the South African Top 20 in 1969 and charting for a massive 38 weeks\, earning them a double gold disc.  In 1969 John Elliot – sax\, joined the group and in 1970 Ivor Black – drums and Peter Vee – lead vocals (Steve Lonsdale left for America).  This song is off the album “Come Back Silly Girl” released in 1965.  On this album the line-up was: Ian Miller (drums and group leader)\, Richard Crouse (lead guitar)\, Billy Andrews (lead vocals and harmonica)\, Jimmy Ryan (bass) and Brian le Gassick (rhythm guitar).

COL title VAL Ain't That Loving COL performer VAL Dennis Brown	COL video title VAL LUTHER INGRAM-ain't hat loving you(for more reason than one) COL description VAL Born Luther Thomas Ingram in Jackson\, Tennessee\, his early interest in music led to him making his first record in 1965 at the age of 28. His first three recordings failed to chart but that changed when he signed for KoKo Records in the late 1960s\, and his first hit "My Honey And Me" peaked at #55 on the Hot 100 on 14 February 1970. Many of his songs appeared in the pop and R&B charts\, even though Koko was only a small label\, owned by his manager and record producer\, Johnny Baylor. Koko and Baylor were closely associated with the Memphis based Stax Records label during the height of its commercial success.   Ingram is best known for the hit\, "(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want to Be Right"\, written by Homer Banks\, Carl Hampton and Raymond Jackson. The song reached number one on Billboard 's R&B chart and peaked at number three on that publication's Hot 100 chart in the summer of 1972. The track stayed in the Hot 100 for 18 weeks\, ultimately selling a reported four million copies.[1] The song was later successfully covered by Millie Jackson and Barbara Mandrell; it has also been recorded by Bobby "Blue" Bland\, Rod Stewart and Isaac Hayes.   Other popular tracks for Ingram included "Ain't That Loving You (For More Reasons Than One)"\, "Let's Steal Away To The Hideaway" and "I'll Be Your Shelter." He also co-authored "Respect Yourself"\, a million seller for the Staples Singers in 1971.[1] The acetate demo version of Ingram's\, "Exus Trek"\, became a sought after Northern soul track.[2] With the Stax connections\, Ingram recorded at the Memphis label's studios\, as well as other southern-based studios such as Muscle Shoals. He was opening act for Isaac Hayes for some years\, and often used Hayes' Movement band and female backing group for his 1970s recordings. He recorded into the 1980s\, and whilst only managing lower R&B chart hits\, he remained a popular stage draw.   Ingram died on March 19\, 2007\, at a Belleville\, Illinois\, hospital of heart failure. According to his wife Jacqui Ingram\, he had suffered for years from diabetes\, kidney disease and partial blindness COL channel name VAL pieroangelo2	1

Mae'r term 'hen ferchetan' yn golygu dynes sydd heb briodi. Traditional Welsh folk song. The term 'hen ferchetan' means a woman who has never married.

But none of the village boys\,  ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, wanted to marry Lisa fach yr Hendre\,  ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  An old maid keeps on trying\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. Wore satin lace and make up\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  But if there's someone for everyone somewhere\, ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, there is no one for Lisa fach yr Hendre\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.

The original line-up consisted of Brian le Gassick – lead vocals\, guitar\, John Leach – lead guitar\, Willie van der Walt – bass and Ian Miller – drums.

In 1969 John Elliot – sax\, joined the group and in 1970 Ivor Black – drums and Peter Vee – lead vocals (Steve Lonsdale left for America).

COL title VAL Mambo No. 5 COL performer VAL Brute Force Steel Band of Antigua	COL video title VAL NYSF Threepenny Opera - 07 - Liebeslied (Look at the Moon over Soho) COL description VAL This is an LP transfer of the 1976 New York Shakespeare Festival's revival production of "The Threepenny Opera."  This recording should not be confused with the original 1954 New York production recording\, nor the 1994 Donmar Warehouse production recording in England.  Unlike Marc Blitzstein's version which ran during the 1950's for six years and featured the incomparable Lotte Lenya\, this translation is less sanitized and more in keeping with the seedy and sexual nature of the original german play.    From the liner notes to the album - "the successful Blitzstein version was an adaptation rather than a translation\, and in comparing it to the original\, we were surprised at the extent to which his treatment vitiated the political and sexual thrust which gives the work its relentless power.  Blitzstein sweetened and cleaned up Brecht's unsparing lyrics\, partially in deference to stage censorship...but in doing so he in many instances changed Brecht's meanings around entirely\, and throughout he softened the impact of Brecht's biting ferocity.  He also attempted to make the lyrics more 'singable' by fitting them into conventional musical patterns\, and in this he succeeded admirably."  The translation used for this revival was prepared by Ralph Maheim and John Willett; the full text can be found in their edition of Brecht's Collected Plays\, Volume 2.  A hardcover edition was also published in conjunction with the revival.  This revival was directed by conceptual theater artist Richard Foreman\, and starred Raul Julia and Ellen Greene\, both of whom were nominated for Tony Awards.  It was produced by Joseph Papp and the New York Shakespeare Festival at the Vivian Beaumont Theatre at Lincoln Center.  Additional information regarding the production\, including cast list\, can be found at the Internet Broadway Database's listing for this revival at http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=3835 ...  As of June 2007\, this cast album has not been released or reissued on CD; it was originally made available in 1976 on LP\, and this is an LP transfer.  As such\, the quality is not CD quality  - there will occasionally be noise\, popping\, or hissing.

Classic Folk sheds new light on the success of the urban intellectual-driven movement that made rural white and African-American artists and their music favorites of audiences everywhere. This recording features classic performances by classic artists doing some of their classic songs during the great folksong revival of the 1940s through 1960s. It features some of the great performances from the vaults of Folkways Records. Compiled and annotated by Jeff Place.

COL title VAL Early in the Morning COL performer VAL Buddy Holly	COL video title VAL Bob Luman - Early in The Morning (1958) COL description VAL Bob Luman on His 4th appearence on Town Hall Party at 1958.  ---ABOUT THE SONG--- "Early In The Morning" [US #24 - 1958] was a song written and recorded by Bobby Darin for Brunswick Records\, but as Darin was still under contract to Atlantic Records' subsidiary\, Atco\, the song was released by "The Ding Dongs". New York deejays liked the record and Atco soon discovered the deception. Brunswick was forced to turn over the masters to Atco which released the record under the name "The Rinky Dinks".  --- ABOUT THE ARTIST--- Bob Luman recieved his early musical influence in Nacogdoches\, Texas\, as his father was an amateur fiddle\, guitar and harmonica player.  In 1956\, he won a talent contest which earned him an appearance on the Louisiana Hayride. For the Hayride\, Luman formed a backup band called the Shadows. In 1957\, the band signed with Imperial Records\, where they recorded "All Night Long" and "Amarillo Blues".That same year\, the band appeared for the first time on the Town Hall Party in Los Angeles\, and appeared in the movie Carnival Rock. In 1958\, dropped by Imperial Records\, Luman signed with Capitol Records\, where he released "Try Me" and "I Know My Baby Cares." Capitol Records wanted Luman to change his name\, which he refused to do\, so he left the record label and signed with Warner Bros. Records\, recording "Class of '59" and "Loretta". In 1960\, Luman was drafted into the United States Army. It was while still in the Army that Warner Bros. Records released Luman's best-known crossover hit\, "Let's Think About Living\," a novelty song that hit #7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and #9 on the Billboard country music chart. After leaving the Army in 1962\, Luman moved to Nashville\, where he married. In 1965\, he joined the Grand Ole Opry. Luman toured frequently in the 60s and 70s\, and became popular in Las Vegas\, with an act which combined country and rockabilly. He signed with Epic Records in 1968\, and had several hits with them\, including "Still Loving You" and "Lonely Women Make Good Lovers" -his biggest country hit\, hitting #4 on the country chart. Luman's other country hits included "Ain't Got Time To Be Unhappy" (1968)\, "Ballad of Two Brothers" (with Autry Inman\, 1968)\, "When You Say Love" (1972)\, "Neither One Of Us (Wants To Be The First To Say Goodbye)" (1973)\, "Proud Of You Baby" (1975)\, and "The Pay Phone" (1977). Luman died in Nashville of pneumonia in 1978\, at the age of forty-one. After his death\, Bear Family Records released several compilations of his songs\, including More of the Rocker\, Still Rockin' and Carnival Rock. Luman is a member of both the Rockabilly Hall of Fame and the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame.  source: www.wikipedia.org COL channel name VAL AugieBurr	1

Smart Dog Videos London (UK). Sacred Cowboys are an Australian post-punk and rock band formed by mainstay Garry Gray\, as lead singer-songwriter\, in 1982. The line-up has changed as the group splintered and reformed several times\, being active from 1982 to 1985\, 1987 to 1991\, 1994 to 1997 and 2006 to 2008. The August 2006 line-up was Gray with Stephan Fidock on drums; Penny Ikinger on guitar; Spencer P. Jones on guitar; Nick Rischbieth on bass guitar; and Ash Wednesday on keyboards. Past members include: Johnny Crash (aka Janis Friedenfelds) on drums and Mark Ferrie on bass guitar\, who were both ex-Models; Terry Doolan on guitar; Andrew Picouleau on bass guitar; and Ian Forrest on keyboards.  The group have issued six albums: Sacred Cowboys (1984)\, We Love You ... Of Course We Do (1985)\, Trouble from Providence (August 1988)\, Things to Come (July 1996)\, Cold Harvest (January 2007) and 1982–85: Nailed to the Cross (February 2008). Australian musicologist\, Ian McFarlane\, described them as "one of the most confrontational live outfits" with their music as "mixed post-punk moodiness and country raunch over a mutant swamp-blues backbeat".

COL title VAL Brick House COL performer VAL The Commodores	COL video title VAL LURLEAN HUNTER  Vocal Jazz Swing. Steppin' Out With My Baby \, I Feel COL description VAL Lurlean Hunter  Singer Lurlean Hunter made five albums on her own during the second half of the '50s\, starting out as a Lonesome Gal on RCA and winding up still feeling Blue & Sentimental for Atlantic. She was discovered in Chicago where she had been singing in many clubs\, including a collaboration with drummer Red Saunders that held forth at the Club DeLisa. Hunter's move to New York City in 1955 was prompted by RCA's interest in recording her. The singer's recording career actually began before she left the Windy City at the behest of indie jazz labels\, some of them quite short-lived -- such as Seymour\, with a catalog topping out at four releases. The press described Hunter as a "blues thrush" in announcing her interpretations of three numbers actually written by the label's owner\, producer and record store owner Seymour Schwartz. The latter promotional blurb inevitably told some truth about Hunter's stylistic traits\, if not her relation to winged fauna. Her recordings were more about rhythm & blues and pop than jazz\, yet were done in an era when such sessions often involved fine mainstream jazz players in the accompaniment. The 1956Night Life\, for example\, featured pianist Hank Jones and tenor saxophonist Al Cohn. Blue & Sentimental -- with arrangements by the progressive Jimmy Giuffre -- was reissued in 2000 as a split CD also including an album by fellow singer Betty Bennett\, a former wife of pianist André Previn.Hunter's final recordings were done in 1964\, at which point she was still well under 40 years old. She is known to have died young\, although details of this tragedy are murky. In one version of the story she was knocked off by a mobster lover\, yet whether anybody was really that mean to Lurlean cannot be completely confirmed.

Mae'r term 'hen ferchetan' yn golygu dynes sydd heb briodi. Traditional Welsh folk song. The term 'hen ferchetan' means a woman who has never married.  The translation 'old maid' doesn't mean that the maid in question is actually old of age :-)  Geiriau: Hen ferchetan wedi colli'i chariad\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. Cael un arall\, dyna oedd ei bwriad\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Ond nid oedd un o lancie'r pentre\, ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, am briodi Lisa fach yr Hendre\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Hen ferchetan sydd yn dal i drio\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. Gwisgo lase sidan ac ymbincio\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Ond os oes brân i frân yn rhywle\, ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, nid oes neb i Lisa fach yr Hendre\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Hen ferchetan bron â thorri'i chalon\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. Mynd i'r llan mae pawb o'r hen gariadon\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Bydd tatws newydd ar bren 'fale\, ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, cyn briodith Lisa fach yr Hendre\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Hen ferchetan aeth i Ffair y Bala\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. Gweld Siôn Prys yn fachgen digon smala\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Gair a ddywedodd wrth fynd adre'\, ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, gododd calon Lisa fach yr Hendre\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Gododd calon Lisa fach yr Hendre\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  English Translation Lyrics: An old maid lost her lover\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. To get another\, that was her intention\,  ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  But none of the village boys\,  ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, wanted to marry Lisa fach yr Hendre\,  ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  An old maid keeps on trying\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. Wore satin lace and make up\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  But if there's someone for everyone somewhere\, ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, there is no one for Lisa fach yr Hendre\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  The old maid's heart is almost broken\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. All of her old lovers have married\,  ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  There'll be new potatoes on apple trees\, ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, before Lisa fach yr Hendre will marry\,  ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  The old maid went to Fair in Bala\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. Saw Siôn Prys an attractive lad\,  ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  A word he spoke as he went home\, ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, lifted Lisa fach yr Hendre's heavy heart \, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Lifted Lisa fach yr Hendre's heavy heart \, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. COL channel name VAL DistantDreamer93	1

COL title VAL Johnny Too Bad COL performer VAL The Nighthawks [2]	COL video title VAL The Easy Riders -- South Coast COL description VAL The Easy Riders were an American folk music band\, that operated from 1956 to 1959\, consisting of Terry Gilkyson\, Richard Dehr\, and Frank Miller. Their career was guided by Mitch Miller\, who had them under contract for Columbia Records. Their greatest hit\, in early 1957\, was the song "Marianne". The group also composed some tunes for the 1958 cinemiracle-documentaryWindjammer\, such as "Kari Waits for Me" and "Sugar Cane". One of Gilkyson's songs was a number one hit for Frankie Laine\, "The Cry of the Wild Goose". Gilkyson wrote many tunes for Laine\, and he and The Easy Riders were also featured on Frankie's 1957 hit\, "Love Is a Golden Ring"\, having also penned the number for Laine.  Many songs of the group became better known through the interpretation of other singers\, such as the Kingston Trio\, Gale Storm\, Harry Belafonte\, Doris Day\, Burl Ives and the The Brothers Four. Their song "Memories Are Made of This" became a top hit through the interpretation by Dean Martin. After the Easy Riders made a single with the 1927 song "Tell The Captain"\, the Beach Boys adapted it and made of it their hit "Sloop John B". Gilkyson left the group in the early 1960s to work for Disney studios and wrote the Oscar-nominated "The Bear Necessities" for Disney's The Jungle Book.

(don't confuse  with many other compilations\, they has another 1996 re-recorded version)  NO JIVE is ABSOLUTELY THE BEST COMPILATION ABOUT JOSE FELICIANO 2 CD with his hit and many rarities never released before and many intrumentals  The song is also famous in the cover by George Benson in his hit album "Breezin" from 1976 and recently sampled by DJ Nujabes in Counting Stars part of the Samurai Champloo line up as "Shino's Theme" Video isn't of the.... Vinyl Version!!  here the story "How George Benson covered Affirmation by Jose Feliciano" by his producer LiPuma  A review by '70s for Breezin LP  Though Side One of Breezin' had the hits\, Side Two was a creamy\, seamless masterpiece unto itself. It unfolded with "Affirmation\," a song composed by Jose Feliciano\, the international superstar singer/guitarist/composer who had recorded it on his album\, Just Wanna Rock 'N' Roll (RCA)\, from the fall of '75. "Affirmation" was the sole instrumental on that Feliciano LP\, providing the blind Puerto Rican wunderkind a golden opportunity to showcase his skills on acoustic Spanish guitar\, electric rhythm guitar (with a wah-wah effect)\, electric bass\, congas and as a string arranger! LiPuma was enchanted with the melody of Feliciano's relatively brief (3:33) recording. When material was being prepared for Breezin'\, he presented it to Benson\, who liked it immediately. The band worked up an arrangement that loosened and elongated the vibe of the original. Like Feliciano's version\, George begins "Affirmation" alone\, caressing an introduction of choice notes and a smooth rendering of its signature run down the frets. But when the rhythm section eases in\, led by MacDonald's congas\, the groove is more relaxed and funky in a way that is quite different from Feliciano's more insistent arrangement\, which throbbed with forthright Latin pride. Where Feliciano had his rhythm section drop out for the soaring bridge\, Benson's band rides it like the wind\, drummer Mason liberating the rhythm by opening up on his cymbals. Benson tickles the strings with a tasty solo that leads into the killer breakdown section\, with Upchurch dipping into his effects bag. And then\, in what has to be one of the all-time classiest hand-offs in music\, Benson makes way for Dalto's wistful electric piano (complete with soulful little comps) before Benson takes it home\, getting in a few final signature licks. Benson's "Affirmation" is seven minutes of masterful musical heaven. http://www.fantasticfeliciano.too.it/ COL channel name VAL Thevolumex	0

COL title VAL My Love COL performer VAL Petula Clark	COL video title VAL Little Birdie - Vernon Dalhart COL description VAL Recorded on September 19\, 1925 under the pseudonym of Al Craver. Dalhart was born in Jefferson\, Texas. He took his stage name from two towns\, Vernon and Dalhart in Texas\, between which he punched cattle in the 1890s. Dalhart's father\, Robert Marion Slaughter was killed by his brother-in-law\, Bob Castleberry\, when Vernon was age 10. When Vernon was 12 or 13\, the family moved from Jefferson to Dallas\, Texas. Vernon\, who already could play the jaw harp and harmonica\, received vocal training at the Dallas Conservatory of Music. He married Sadie Lee Moore-Livingston in 1901 and had two children\, a son and a daughter. Around 1910 the family moved to New York City. He found employment in a piano warehouse and took occasional singing jobs. One of his first roles was in Giacomo Puccini's opera Girl of the Golden West; following this he played the part of Ralph Rackstraw in a production of HMS Pinafore. He also played the part of Lieutenant Pinkerton in Madame Butterfly.  He saw an advertisement in the local newspaper for singers and applied\, and was auditioned by Thomas Alva Edison; he would thereafter make numerous records for Edison Records. From 1916 until 1923\, using numerous pseudonyms\, he made over 400 recordings of light classical music and early dance band vocals for various record labels. He was already an established singer when he made his first country music recordings which cemented his place in music history. Dalhart's 1924 recording of "The Wreck of the Old 97"—a classic American railroad ballad about the September 27\, 1903 derailment of Southern Railway Fast Mail train No. 97 near Danville\, Virginia—for the Victor Talking Machine Company\, became a runaway hit\, alerting the national record companies to the existence of a sizable market for country-style vocals. It became the first Southern song to become a national success. The double-sided single eventually sold more than seven million copies\, a colossal number for a mid-1920s recording. It was the best-selling single to its time\, and was the biggest-selling non-holiday record in the first 70 years of recorded music. Research by Billboard statistician Joel Whitburn determined "The Prisoner's Song" to have been a No. 1 hit for 12 weeks in 1925-26. In 1998\, "The Prisoner's Song" was honored with a Grammy Hall of Fame Award and the Recording Industry Association of America named it one of the Songs of the Century. It was the desire of the Victor Talking Machine Company to duplicate the sales success of 'Wreck/Prisoner' that led them to contract with Ralph S. Peer to go to the southern mountains in the Summer of 1927 to facilitate 'The Bristol Sessions'\, arguably the single-most important recording event in the history of country music\, where Jimmie Rodgers and the original Carter Family were first discovered\, and after which\, Peer's royalty model would become the standard of the entire recorded music industry. He recorded under a host of pseudonyms given to him by recording managers. On Grey Gull Records he often used the pseudonym Vel Veteran\, which was however also used by other singers\, including Arthur Fields (Fields also used the pseudonym "Mr. X"). It is thought that Dalhart had the most recordings of any person in history. To some\, Dalhart's Southern accent seemed artificial. In a 1918 interview Dalhart said\, "When you are born and brought up in the South your only trouble is to talk any other way...the sure 'nough Southerner talks almost like a Negro\, even when he's white. I've broken myself of the habit\, more or less\, in ordinary conversation\, but it still comes pretty easy." While some country music purists always viewed Dalhart with some suspicion because of his light opera background and a vocal style that was closer to pop than country\, he was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970\, into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1981 and into the Gennett Records Walk of Fame in 2007. Dalhart died in Bridgeport\, Connecticut in 1948 and is interred there in the Mountain Grove Cemetery. COL channel name VAL althazarr's good time oldies	0

Pepper\,  was of Native American descent\, from the Plains tribes of the Kaw and the Cree. He came from a family of "road men"\, the peyote priests of the Native American Church. He was also a jazz saxophonist\, playing primarily tenor sax (but also soprano sax and flute).  encouraged by friends Ornette Coleman and Don Cherry\, Pepper began experimenting with mixing Native American music and jazz\, with interesting results. "Witchi Tai To" is a prime example of that blending\, taking a peyote song he'd learned from his grandfather and putting it in a jazz setting. COL channel name VAL mojavemoog	0
COL title VAL Ain't No Way COL performer VAL Glee Cast	COL video title VAL Nine Below Zero - Sonny Boy Williamson (Trumpet) COL description VAL Recorded on December 4\, 1951. Williamson's first recording session took place in 1951 for Lillian McMurry of Jackson\, Mississippi's Trumpet Records\, three years after the death of John Lee Williamson\, which for the first time allowed some legitimacy to Miller's carefully worded claim to being "the one and only Sonny Boy Williamson". McMurry later erected Williamson's headstone\, near Tutwiler\, Mississippi\, in 1977. Checker Records When Trumpet went bankrupt in 1955\, Sonny Boy's recording contract was yielded to its creditors\, who sold it to Chess Records in Chicago\, Illinois. Sonny Boy had begun developing a following in Chicago beginning in 1953\, when he appeared there as a member of Elmore James's band. It was during his Chess years that he enjoyed his greatest success and acclaim\, recording about 70 songs for Chess subsidiary Checker Records from 1955 to 1964. Sonny Boy's first LP record was titled Down and Out Blues and was released by Checker Records in 1959. Ace Records One single\, "Boppin' With Sonny" b/w "No Nights By Myself" was released with Ace Records in 1955.

It was also used as the B-side of their 1967 single "All You Need Is Love". New mixes of the song were made available on the compilation albums Magical Mystery Tour and Yellow Submarine Songtrack.  Composition  Two song fragments were combined to create "Baby\, You're a Rich Man". The verses from "One of the Beautiful People" by John Lennon were combined with Paul McCartney's previously unaccompanied "Baby\, you're a rich man ..." chorus. Two songs were combined in a similar fashion to make "A Day in the Life"\, and "I've Got a Feeling".  Recording  The song was recorded and mixed (in mono) on 11 May 1967 at Olympic Sound Studios. The music featured an unusual oboe-like sound which was created with a clavioline (an early forerunner of the synthesiser) and a spin-echo (feed back delay) effect which was used to fill from the end of one line of the verse to the start of the next.  Personnel  Per Lewisohn & MacDonald:  John Lennon -- double-tracked vocal\, clavioline\, piano Paul McCartney -- harmony vocal\, piano\, bass George Harrison -- harmony vocal\, guitar\, handclaps Ringo Starr -- drums\, tambourine\, maracas\, handclaps Brian Jones -- oboe Eddie Kramer -- vibraphone George Martin -- producer Keith Grant -- engineer  Mick Jagger was also present and his name appears on a session tape box\, possibly indicating that he provided backing vocals near the end of the song.

Now that you know who you are What do you want to be? And have you travelled very far? Far as the eye can see. How does it feel to be One of the beautiful people? How often have you been there? Often enough to know. What did you see\, when you were there? Nothing that doesn't show. Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man too. You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo. What a thing to do. Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man too. How does it feel to be One of the beautiful people? Tuned to a natural E Happy to be that way. Now that you've found another key What are you going to play? Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man too. You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo. What a thing to do. Baby you're a rich man...

I lay there in the sun And felt it caressing my face As I fell asleep And dreamed. I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie And that I was the star of the movie. This really blew my mind\, The fact that me\, An overfed\, long-haired\, leaping gnome\, Should be the star of a Hollywood movie. Hmm\, but there I was. I was taken to a place\, The hall of the mountain king. I stood high upon a mountain top\, Naked to the world\, In front of every kind of girl. There was long ones\, tall ones\, short ones\, brown ones\, Black ones\, round ones\, big ones\, crazy ones. Out of the middle Came a lady. She whispered in my ear Something crazy. She said\, Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl." I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back As she disappeared\, But soon she returned. In her hand was a bottle of wine\, In the other\, a glass. She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass And raised it to her lips And\, just before she drank it\, She said\, Take the wine\, take that girl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl." Take that pearl\, yeah. It's on girl\, all you gotta do is spill that wine\, spill that wine. Let me feel\, let me feel fine\, yeah\, yeah. Spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, take that pearl.

Dette er en sang som jeg liker veldig godt og som betyr veldig mye for meg. ___________________________________  Ja fysst så vil je nevne min stilling og min stæinn\, je står og svarver hatter i Salomo sitt læinn. Sjøl bær je navnet Jørgen\, så skilnaden er stor\, men både je og Salomo kom nakne tel vår jord.  Refr.:  Sola skin på deg så skuggen fell på meg men graset er grønt for æille.  Når liljene på marken i fager blomstring står\, og alle himlens fugler sin glade trille slår\, je nynne såmmå strofa i hattemakergrenn\, og morgendagen\, Salomo\, hva vet vel vi om den?  Refr.  Har Salomo sitt måltid med vin og fylte fat\, je sug på harde skorper og kæille det for mat\, men det vi gir ifrå øss di vi i lønndom går blir gras til hyrdens hvite lam og Sarons sorte får.  Refr.  Når dronningen av Saba gjør Salomo visitt\, je ser a "Lea Lettvint" og hu har tenkt seg hit. Om leiet blir forskjellig frå silkeseng tel strå\, vi går mot såmmå paradis og hører harper slå.  Refr.  Når sola synk og dale bak slottets tårn og tind\, så kjæm den mørke natta med drøm og tankespinn\, der blir je sjøl Kong Salomo og hæin blir kænskje den som står og svarver hatter uti hattemakergrenn.

Harry reportedly told arranger Jimmy Haskell that "My Mother told me someday I'd have a day like this!" Nonetheless\, Harry plays some of his most passionate trumpet on this album. This song\, "Cimarron" was a routine western-swing\, country song done by several country and western artists. But Harry James plays it as a lightning quick exhibition of his bravado style. Proving that in 1966\, Harry James could still play anything. COL channel name VAL Chuck Par-Due	0

COL title VAL Old Friends COL performer VAL Liza Minnelli	COL video title VAL Shanley Del - Day After Day (Non-LP Track) COL description VAL Here's a much-sought-after Non-LP track from New Zealand/Aussie artist\, Shanley Del.  It was the 3rd track on her 2001 CD Single\, released in Australia by rooArt Records\, cat. # 74321848392. The other two tracks\, "Sleep" and "All I Want" were also on her album "The Other Side"\, but this track was an orphan...to my knowledge\, this single is the only place it was ever issued.  It is a gentle\, acoustic-pop remake of the Badfinger classic.  Prior to this release\, Shanley was considered a country artist\, but\, this album had much more of a Pop flavour\, which I guess accounts for the album title\, "The Other Side". As part of the new image\, she also dropped the 'Del" from her name...on this release\, she is simply called "Shanley".  *** If you like my channel\, why not SUBSCRIBE?

COL title VAL I Wonder How the Old Folks Are at Home COL performer VAL The Statler Brothers	COL video title VAL Uriah Heep - Lady in Black COL description VAL http://www.discogs.com/artist/Uriah+Heep http://www.myspace.com/uriaheep  Uriah Heep's by-the-books progressive heavy metal made the British band one of the most popular hard rock groups of the early '70s. Formed by vocalist David Byron and guitarist Mick Box in the late '60s\, the group went through an astonishing number of members over the next two decades — nearly 30 different musicians passed through the band over the years. Byron and Box were members of the mid-'60s rock band called the Stalkers; once that band broke up\, the duo formed another group called Spice. Spice would eventually turn into Uriah Heep in the late '60s\, once Ken Hensley (guitar\, keyboards\, vocals) and bassist Paul Newton joined the pair. Former Spice drummer Alex Napier was the band's drummer for a brief time; he was quickly replaced by Nigel Olsson. Uriah Heep released their debut album Very 'eavy...Very 'umble (called Uriah Heep in the U.S.) in 1970. After its release\, Keith Baker became the group's drummer; he recorded Salisbury\, the group's second album\, before deciding he couldn't keep up with the band's extensive touring and was replaced by Ian Clarke. Salisbury\, featuring a 16-minute title track recorded with a 26-piece orchestra\, showcased the band's more progressive tendencies. Later that year\, Ian Clarke was replaced by Lee Kerslake and Mark Clarke replaced Newton; Mark Clarke quickly left the band and Gary Thain became the group's bassist. This lineup of Uriah Heep was its most stable and popular; beginning with 1972's Demons and Wizards\, they released five albums between 1972 and 1975. After 1975\, the band's popularity began to slip. Byron left the band in 1977 and was replaced by John Lawton\, yet the group's fortunes kept declining right into the early '80s. However\, Uriah Heep soldiered on\, continuing to release albums into the '90s and 2000s. The album roster included Different World (1994)\, Sea of Light (1995)\, Sonic Origami (1998)\, and Spellbinder (1999). COL channel name VAL TheDeZyx	0

It was released on the band's fifth full-length studio album\, Document\, and also as a 7" vinyl single in 1987. The song was their first hit single\, reaching #9 in the US Billboard Hot 100\, #14 in Canada\, and later reached #16 in the UK singles chart on its UK release (1991).  The song was included in Activision's Guitar Hero World Tour and is in Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades.  The accompanying video's director was artist Robert Longo.  The director of photography was Alton Brown\, who later became a Food Network chef.  In March 2005\, Q magazine placed "The One I Love" at number 57 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks.  The song is included on R.E.M. Live.  Lyrics and meaning  Many listeners who misunderstand the song's meaning have made the song a popular radio dedication to loved ones\, relying on the main lyric\, "This one goes out to the one I love."  However\, they missed an ensuing line: "A simple prop to occupy my time"; the song was not particularly a love song.  Stipe related in 1987 to Rolling Stone\, "I've always left myself pretty open to interpretation. It's probably better that they just think it's a love song at this point."  However\, in an interview in the January 1988 issue of Musician magazine he said that the song was "incredibly violent" and "It's very clear that it's about using people over and over again".  The song contains only three verses\, which are all near identical\, with small variations each repeat of the verse. (For example "A simple prop to occupy my time"\, "Another prop has occupied my time"). The chorus consists of just the word "fire"\, repeated (with the backing vocal of "She's coming down on her own now/Coming down on her own"\, sung by Mike Mills).

Well the both 12" versions low down and girl you are the one are just as long as the album versions. Alfonzo was a great singer\, with some good songs\, but to my opinion\, they should have launched him as an artist in his own right and not just a copycat of Michal Jackson. This last fact was surely true for his looks. Sadly enough he faded away from the scene\, maybe a wrong choice of managment or something like that. He was a great singer! This song is an absolutely favourite of mine! Anyone knows what happend to him? COL channel name VAL peterpiessens	0

COL description VAL RARE OLDIES VIDEO WITH DAVE LAMBERT \, JON HENDRICKS & YOLANDA BAVAN ! The group formed in 1957 and recorded their first album Sing a Song of Basie for Paramount Records. The album featured versions of Count Basie standards and was successful enough that the Count Basie Orchestra collaborated with them on Sing Along With Basie (1959)\, which was awarded a Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 1998. Beginning in 1959\, the trio recorded three LPs with Columbia Records. Their song "Twisted\," featuring Ross's lyrics set to a Wardell Gray melody\, was featured in Woody Allen's Deconstructing Harry (1997) and has been covered by Joni Mitchell\, Bette Midler and others. Their High Flying won a Grammy Award for Best Performance by a Vocal Group in 1962. Lambert\, Hendricks & Ross were voted Best Vocal Group in the Down Beat Readers Poll from 1959 to 1963. Annie Ross left the group in 1962\, replaced by vocalist Yolande Bavan. The renamed Lambert\, Hendricks and Bavan made three live albums before disbanding in 1964. Lambert\, Hendricks and Bavan appeared at the 1962 Newport Jazz Festival\, and their performance of "Comin' Home" and "Moanin'" can be seen in Buddy Bregman's film The 1962 Newport Jazz Festival. The group was also known as Lambert\, Hendricks and Moss when Canadian jazz singer Anne Marie Moss briefly replaced Annie Ross. Any hopes of a reunion of the original trio ended with Lambert's 1966 death in a car accident. You can watch all my rare oldies soundies on : http://www.myspace.com/swingcocktail !

COL title VAL You're My Best Friend COL performer VAL Queen	COL video title VAL Streets of Baltimore - Nanci Griffith and John Prine COL description VAL from her album\, "Other Voices\, Too - A Trip Back to Bountiful"\, released in 1998. This is Nanci's 15th album and she is joined with other artists. She considers this a follow up to her album\, "Other Voices\, Other Rooms" which was released in 1993. In this album her focus on songwriters is so much a part of the album's spirit. The writers whose songs Nanci has selected range from the well-known\, like British folk-pop artists Richard Thompson and Sandy Denny\, early American rocker Sonny Curtis\, American folksingers Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger and country legend Johnny Cash\, to lesser known writers like John Grimaudo\, Saylor White\, Ian Tyson and Texas songwriter Mickie Merkens\, to Stephen Foster\, perhaps the greatest American songwriter of the 19th century. "We started with several songs that spilled over from the last album\, like Richard Thompson's 'Wall Of Death' and Stephen Foster's 'Hard Times Come Again No More\,' then we went back to the list of songs I felt weren't sung enough".  At times\, we had so many people in the studio -- like when we had 37 for "Wasn't That A Mighty Storm" -- and they wouldn't leave! The beer was free\, the food was good\, everyone got to meet their heroes. It was just so exciting to bring people together.  quotes from Nanci Griffith found on the site homepages.sover.net/~rschrull/ngriffith/othertoo/othertoo.html  I do not own this song.

The english lyrics (well known by the classic Leonard Cohen cover) were written by Hy Zaret.  Bertrand Cantat of Noir Desir provides some french vocals...  LYRICS When they poured across the border I was cautioned to surrender\, this I could not do; I took my gun and vanished.  I have changed my name so often\, I've lost my wife and children but I have many friends\, and some of them are with me.  An old woman gave us shelter\, Kept us hidden in the garret\, then the soldiers came; she died without a whisper.  There were three of us this morning I'm the only one this evening but I must go on; the frontiers are my prison.  Oh\, the wind\, the wind is blowing\, through the graves the wind is blowing\, freedom soon will come; then we'll come from the shadows.  Les Allemands étaient chez moi\, ils me dirent\, "Résigne toi\," mais je n'ai pas peur; j'ai repris mon âme.  (The Germans were at my home They said\, "Sign yourself\," But I am not afraid I have retaken my soul.)  J'ai changé cent fois de nom\, j'ai perdu femme et enfants mais j'ai tant d'amis; j'ai la France entière.  (I've changed names a hundred times I have lost wife and children But I have so many friends I have all of France)  Un vieil homme dans un grenier pour la nuit nous a caché\, les Allemands l'ont pris; il est mort sans surprise.  (An old man\, in an attic Hid us for the night The Germans captured him He died without surprise.)  Oh\, the wind\, the wind is blowing\, through the graves the wind is blowing\, freedom soon will come; then we'll come from the shadows. COL channel name VAL TinderNikos	1

COL title VAL We Live in Two Different Worlds COL performer VAL Hank Williams\, Jr. & Lois Johnson	COL video title VAL Staccatos - Just like Romeo and Juliet COL description VAL The Staccatos are a South African band formed in November 1961 by Brian Le Gassick. The original line-up consisted of Brian le Gassick – lead vocals\, guitar\, John Leach – lead guitar\, Willie van der Walt – bass and Ian Miller – drums. In 1962 Leach and van der Walt were replaced by Richard Crouse – guitar\, Jimmy Routledge – bass and Billy Andrews – vocals\, harmonica (Billy later became one half of the duo the “Dream Merchants” with Billy Forrest). In 1964 the Staccatos won the Transvaal Merseyside Contest\, which included a recording contract with EMI. They supported Peter and Gordon on their tour of South Africa in 1965.  In 1966 Steve Lonsdale took over the lead vocals\, and Richard Crouse married Wanda Arletti who joined the group for a tour of Zambia. In 1967 Eddie Boyle – bass\, and Ronnie Cline – organ\, joined the group. In 1968 Billy Forrest approached the group to record “Cry to me” for the film “Katrina”. This song became their biggest hit\, reaching number 1 on the South African Top 20 in 1969 and charting for a massive 38 weeks\, earning them a double gold disc.  In 1969 John Elliot – sax\, joined the group and in 1970 Ivor Black – drums and Peter Vee – lead vocals (Steve Lonsdale left for America).

COL title VAL Easy to Be Hard COL performer VAL Lynn Kellogg	COL video title VAL Shanley Del - Day After Day (Non-LP Track) COL description VAL Here's a much-sought-after Non-LP track from New Zealand/Aussie artist\, Shanley Del.  It was the 3rd track on her 2001 CD Single\, released in Australia by rooArt Records\, cat. # 74321848392. The other two tracks\, "Sleep" and "All I Want" were also on her album "The Other Side"\, but this track was an orphan...to my knowledge\, this single is the only place it was ever issued.  It is a gentle\, acoustic-pop remake of the Badfinger classic.  Prior to this release\, Shanley was considered a country artist\, but\, this album had much more of a Pop flavour\, which I guess accounts for the album title\, "The Other Side". As part of the new image\, she also dropped the 'Del" from her name...on this release\, she is simply called "Shanley".  *** If you like my channel\, why not SUBSCRIBE?

COL title VAL Ain't That Loving You COL performer VAL Al Campbell	COL video title VAL LUTHER INGRAM-ain't hat loving you(for more reason than one) COL description VAL Born Luther Thomas Ingram in Jackson\, Tennessee\, his early interest in music led to him making his first record in 1965 at the age of 28. His first three recordings failed to chart but that changed when he signed for KoKo Records in the late 1960s\, and his first hit "My Honey And Me" peaked at #55 on the Hot 100 on 14 February 1970. Many of his songs appeared in the pop and R&B charts\, even though Koko was only a small label\, owned by his manager and record producer\, Johnny Baylor. Koko and Baylor were closely associated with the Memphis based Stax Records label during the height of its commercial success.   Ingram is best known for the hit\, "(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want to Be Right"\, written by Homer Banks\, Carl Hampton and Raymond Jackson. The song reached number one on Billboard 's R&B chart and peaked at number three on that publication's Hot 100 chart in the summer of 1972. The track stayed in the Hot 100 for 18 weeks\, ultimately selling a reported four million copies.[1] The song was later successfully covered by Millie Jackson and Barbara Mandrell; it has also been recorded by Bobby "Blue" Bland\, Rod Stewart and Isaac Hayes.   Other popular tracks for Ingram included "Ain't That Loving You (For More Reasons Than One)"\, "Let's Steal Away To The Hideaway" and "I'll Be Your Shelter." He also co-authored "Respect Yourself"\, a million seller for the Staples Singers in 1971.[1] The acetate demo version of Ingram's\, "Exus Trek"\, became a sought after Northern soul track.[2] With the Stax connections\, Ingram recorded at the Memphis label's studios\, as well as other southern-based studios such as Muscle Shoals. He was opening act for Isaac Hayes for some years\, and often used Hayes' Movement band and female backing group for his 1970s recordings. He recorded into the 1980s\, and whilst only managing lower R&B chart hits\, he remained a popular stage draw.   Ingram died on March 19\, 2007\, at a Belleville\, Illinois\, hospital of heart failure. According to his wife Jacqui Ingram\, he had suffered for years from diabetes\, kidney disease and partial blindness COL channel name VAL pieroangelo2	1

COL video title VAL John Fogerty - Have Thine Own Way\, Lord.wmv COL description VAL The Blue Ridge Rangers Is the first solo album by John Fogerty\, the former lead singer and lead guitarist of Creedence Clearwater Revival. Upon its initial release by Fantasy Records in 1973\, the album was credited to "The Blue Ridge Rangers" with no mention of Fogerty on the cover. Fogerty chose to do this in order to distance himself from his Creedence legacy. The LP was later reissued and credited to John Fogerty with a different cover design. The CD reissue restores the original silhouette cover photo and credits the album to Fogerty. The album is made up entirely of traditional and country covers\, and features Fogerty playing all the instruments. The album peaked at #47 on the charts. Two singles from the album became hits: "Jambalaya" which peaked at #16\, and "Hearts of Stone" which peaked at #37. In 2009\, Fogerty released a sequel to this album\, entitled The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again.  Track listing Side one 1. "Blue Ridge Mountain Blues" (Traditional) -- 2:29 2.

The Sunsets were a 1950s-influenced rock'n'roll outfit from Penarth\, South Glamorgan that had evolved from a band\, previously called The Backbeats since 1958\,[3] who invited Stevens to join them after he had been an avid fan of the band for several years and occasionally hopped on stage to do a guest vocal.  An early break for Shaky and the band presented itself when they were given a support slot for The Rolling Stones in December 1969. Despite landing a recording contract with Parlophone Records the following year and releasing a Dave Edmunds produced album\, the optimistically and prematurely titled A Legend\, the band found success hard to come by\, at least in their native Great Britain\, though they had several hit singles in other countries. The band toured Germany and the Netherlands in between regular UK dates as the band's reputation for staging a vibrant and exciting show grew.[ COL channel name VAL ArkivArkiv	0

COL description VAL RARE OLDIES VIDEO WITH DAVE LAMBERT \, JON HENDRICKS & YOLANDA BAVAN ! The group formed in 1957 and recorded their first album Sing a Song of Basie for Paramount Records. The album featured versions of Count Basie standards and was successful enough that the Count Basie Orchestra collaborated with them on Sing Along With Basie (1959)\, which was awarded a Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 1998. Beginning in 1959\, the trio recorded three LPs with Columbia Records. Their song "Twisted\," featuring Ross's lyrics set to a Wardell Gray melody\, was featured in Woody Allen's Deconstructing Harry (1997) and has been covered by Joni Mitchell\, Bette Midler and others. Their High Flying won a Grammy Award for Best Performance by a Vocal Group in 1962. Lambert\, Hendricks & Ross were voted Best Vocal Group in the Down Beat Readers Poll from 1959 to 1963. Annie Ross left the group in 1962\, replaced by vocalist Yolande Bavan. The renamed Lambert\, Hendricks and Bavan made three live albums before disbanding in 1964. Lambert\, Hendricks and Bavan appeared at the 1962 Newport Jazz Festival\, and their performance of "Comin' Home" and "Moanin'" can be seen in Buddy Bregman's film The 1962 Newport Jazz Festival. The group was also known as Lambert\, Hendricks and Moss when Canadian jazz singer Anne Marie Moss briefly replaced Annie Ross. Any hopes of a reunion of the original trio ended with Lambert's 1966 death in a car accident. You can watch all my rare oldies soundies on : http://www.myspace.com/swingcocktail !

COL title VAL Modinha COL performer VAL Tricia Evy	COL video title VAL 'With my eyes wide open I'm dreaming'--Patti Page 'Quartet' (1949) COL description VAL Recorded in November 1949\, this is a classic example of 'multiple' recording\, as opposed to multitrack recording.  At the time this record was made there were no multitrack tape recorders.  In fact\, the studio this was recorded at (most likely Reeves in New York City) had yet to acquire tape equipment; hence\, this recording was made by first recording part of the music on one lacquer disc\, then playing this disc back through a mixer while another part was played or sung live along with the playback\, the mix of these parts being then recorded onto a second lacquer disc.  This was done four times (original recording plus three overdubs) to produce the four vocal parts heard on this record.   Les Paul was the first to produce successful 'multiples' (as he called them)\, both technically and artistically\, and what his label Capitol nicknamed 'The New Sound' spawned a brief fad where other performers tried to mimic his recording technique on their records\, with varying degrees of success.  This record was one of the better ones\, and Patti Page had several hits with this type of sound. COL channel name VAL PerisphereRec	0

COL title VAL Burn Down the Cornfield COL performer VAL Charlie Musselwhite	COL video title VAL THE RUFFIN BROTHERS -"LO & BEHOLD" (1970) COL description VAL With neither Ruffin brother experiencing significant success in the wake of their non-simultaneous departure from the Temptations\, Jimmy latched upon the idea of recording a duet album with the younger David -- partially as a way to pay tribute to their recently passed parents\, partially as a way to jump-start their stalled careers. In regards to the latter\, 1970's I Am My Brother's Keeper was no great shakes\, barely scraping the pop charts and its lead single "Stand by Me" only reaching 24 on the R&B charts\, but as a testament to the familial talents of the Ruffins\, the LP succeeds\, proving that these two great voices could enliven familiar tunes. It's a knack that's needed here\, for much of I Am My Brother's Keeper consists of splashy\, sequin-studded and polyester-draped covers of pop and R&B hits. Just under half of the album consists of versions of tunes by the Hollies\, Ben E. King\, the Delfonics and Tyrone Davis\, with the rest of the record coming from in-house Motown writers and elsewhere\, including the rousing Gloria Jones co-write "When My Love Hand Comes Down." This is one of five Bobby Taylor productions on the LP\, and he gives the Ruffins soulful\, funky sounds that showcase them at their best\, with Henry Cosby\, Duke Browner\, Frank Wilson and Al Kent responsible for the songs that edge a little closer to the pop charts. Combined\, all the producers provide a sampler of Motown sounds at the dawn of the '70s -- sometimes things are deeply funky\, sometimes things are slick enough for a televised variety revue -- but the Ruffins pull it all together\, sounding comfortable in every setting\, always commanding attention. Perhaps its underwhelming commercial performance is understandable -- there are no true knockouts here\, just a bunch of strong soul -- but I Am My Brother's Keeper is an album that seems stronger in retrospect\, as it was the last time one of the great brother teams in soul sung together so joyfully. [Hip-O Select's 2010 reissue adds the excellent unreleased "You're What I Need (Not What I Want)" -- produced by Bobby Taylor and co-written by Gloria Jones and Pamela Sawyer -- and a mix of "Stand by Me" that removes the fake live overdubs of the original.

This has Noel Boggs on Steel\, which means after the war probably 1946. Alex Beshear on trumpet plays it without a mute.  That was quite unusual for him.  Also Tommy sings it.  When Bob made the Okey 78\, the vocalist was Danny Alguire\, who also played trumpet.  Tommy had joined the army when that session took play. So here we get to hear the way he would have done it.  Just wish the quality was better.  Notice the accordian?  Bob never used one in his recordings\, and I have to wonder where Noel plugged in his steel guitar.  Behind a tree?  Hot session\, though.

In questa puntata (la seconda delle tre) propose "Il volto della vita"\, lanciato in Italia da Caterina Caselli ma già noto negli States col titolo "The Days Of Pearly Spencer". Il brano in questione è contenuto col nuovo titolo de "La sirena di Ipanema" nell'album "Vietato ai minori" terzo capitolo della trilogia cover realizzata da Ivan nell'81 (Duemila60 Italian Graffiati)\, nell'83 (Bandiera gialla) e nell'86 appunto con "Vietato ai minori".   Il Volto Della Vita  Con il corpo sono qui ma la mente mia non c'è\, corre dietro a dei ricordi e chi la ferma più. I miei occhi sono chiusi\, ma ci vedo molto bene\, son davanti ad una casa\, entro e vedo te...  Il volto della vita... Il volto dell'amore.  Rose rosse alle pareti\, giochi d'ombra sul tuo viso\, come rami le mie braccia si apron verso te. Ed ancora la mia mente non è stanca di vagare e mi porta lungo un fiume e in fondo vedo te.  Il volto della vita... Il volto dell'amore...  Sei vestito un poco strano ma d'altronde\, come sempre\, il mio cuore ti fa festa\, sono a un passo da te. Ma qualcuno ha bussato e il mio viaggio è terminato\, io mi alzo per aprire\, apro e vedo te...  Il volto della vita... Il volto dell'amore... Il volto della vita...

COL title VAL You Should Be Dancing COL performer VAL Bee Gees feat. Jessie J\, Tinie Tempah and Taio Cruz	COL video title VAL Monaco - You Should Be Dancing COL description VAL This is from the 1998 Bee Gees Tribute Album - Gotta Get A Message to You. This is probably the closest we'll ever get to a New Order cover of a Bee Gees song.  "The Bee Gees have written so many classic songs. It was a hard choice - but we chose You Should Be Dancing because we do like a bit of a dance. Being in a group is quite a wonderful job\, and charity work is an easy thing to do - We are great believers in giving something back. Homelessness is a very scary thing. Having no family\, no base\, nowhere to go and get your head together is a terrifying prospect." COL channel name VAL chummytummy1971	1

COL title VAL Bama Lama Bama Loo COL performer VAL Little Bob [1]	COL video title VAL The Charlie Daniels Band - Pride And Joy.wmv COL description VAL Tailgate Party This CD contains some of the greatest rock songs of all time. Originally made legendary by some of the south's best rock bands\, Charlie adds his own unique sound to each song. Originals\, live and studio versions make this collection live up to its' name by being a great one to pull out during a "Tailgate Party."   Description      13 Tracks previously released in 1999     Engineered\, Produced and Mixed by: Ron W. Griffin     Executive Producer: David Corlew  Guide Review - Charlie Daniels Band - Tailgate Party  Included on this very southern rock flavored collection are live versions of "The Legend of Wooley Swamp" and "The Devil Went Down to Georgia." With both songs being so well known and played a gazillion times\, it was refreshing to hear them live and just slightly different from what we are normally accustomed to.  "The South's Gonna Do It Again" had an added bonus to it by having a very early on in his career performance by Keith Urban\, showing us some very impressive guitar solo's. Remakes of ZZ Top's "Sharp Dressed Man" and Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Freebird" were very captivating and showed off some incredible fiddle playing by Charlie. Probably one of my most favorites was CDB's remake of the song made famous by Hootie and the Blowfish\, "Let Her Cry." Charlie has always been well known for his playing but under rated for his vocals. This song shows off just how well he can deliver some very heartfelt emotions and I really enjoyed listening to this new version.  If you have ever appreciated CDB\, you will really like this release. If for nothing else\, the diversity of the genre's and CDB being able to add the country sound without destroying the memory of the song.  Track Listing  1 The South's Gonna Do It  3:57 2 Pride and Joy  4:03 3 Can't You See  6:26 4 Let Her Cry  4:00 5 Homesick  3:53 6 Keep Your Hands to Yourself  3:12 7 Statesboro Blues  4:22 8 Peach County Jamboree  3:18 9 Sharp Dressed Man  4:46 10 Free Bird  6:38 11 The Legend of Wooley Swamp [Live]  5:21 12 El Toreador [Live]  5:26 13 The Devil Went Down to Georgia [Live]  3:44 COL channel name VAL SOUTHERN REBEL	0

COL title VAL Hi-de-Ho (That Old Sweet Roll) COL performer VAL Carole King	COL video title VAL That Old Sweet Roll (Hi-De-Ho) COL description VAL Hi-De-Ho es el 11º track del álbum "Now that everything's been said" de la banda The City\, en la que participó Carole King antes de lanzarse como solista y mientras no paraba de escribir hits y revolucionar la música. El álbum fue grabado con bajo presupuesto y es casi inconseguible\, pero hay unos LPs a las vueltas y un gran disco para todos... Recomiendo explorar "Snow Queen"\, "I wasn't born to follow" y la canción que da nombre al álbum\, así como los demás trabajos de King\, como "Tapestry" y "Rhymes and Reasons".

At the American Sound\, Memphis\, Tennessee .  Its written by:  Eddie Rabbit / Dick Heard.  Its aviable on: from Elvis in Memphis- which is where this version is from.   Lyrics:  Seven lonely days  And a dozen towns ago I reached out one night  And you were gone Don't know why you'd run\,  What you're running to or from All I know is I want to bring you home  So I'm walking in the rain\,  Thumbing for a ride On this lonely Kentucky backroad I've loved you much too long And my love's too strong To let you go\, never knowing What went wrong  Kentucky rain keeps pouring down And up ahead's another town That I'll go walking thru With the rain in my shoes\, Searchin for you In the cold Kentucky rain\, In the cold Kentucky rain  Showed your photograph To some old gray bearded man Sitting on a bench Outside a gen'ral store They said 'Yes\, she's been here' But their memory wasn't clear Was it yesterday\, No\, wait the day before  So I fin'ly got a ride With a preacher man who asked 'Where you bound on such a dark afternoon?' As we drove on thru the rain As he listened I explained And he left me with a prayer That I'd find you    Disclaimer:  NO COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT INTENDED!

COL title VAL Salomon-Song COL performer VAL Lotte Lenya	COL video title VAL NYSF Threepenny Opera - 19 - Call From the Grave COL description VAL This is an LP transfer of the 1976 New York Shakespeare Festival's revival production of "The Threepenny Opera."  This recording should not be confused with the original 1954 New York production recording\, nor the 1994 Donmar Warehouse production recording in England.  Unlike Marc Blitzstein's version which ran during the 1950's for six years and featured the incomparable Lotte Lenya\, this translation is less sanitized and more in keeping with the seedy and sexual nature of the original german play.    From the liner notes to the album - "the successful Blitzstein version was an adaptation rather than a translation\, and in comparing it to the original\, we were surprised at the extent to which his treatment vitiated the political and sexual thrust which gives the work its relentless power.  Blitzstein sweetened and cleaned up Brecht's unsparing lyrics\, partially in deference to stage censorship...but in doing so he in many instances changed Brecht's meanings around entirely\, and throughout he softened the impact of Brecht's biting ferocity.  He also attempted to make the lyrics more 'singable' by fitting them into conventional musical patterns\, and in this he succeeded admirably."  The translation used for this revival was prepared by Ralph Maheim and John Willett; the full text can be found in their edition of Brecht's Collected Plays\, Volume 2.  A hardcover edition was also published in conjunction with the revival.  This revival was directed by conceptual theater artist Richard Foreman\, and starred Raul Julia and Ellen Greene\, both of whom were nominated for Tony Awards.  It was produced by Joseph Papp and the New York Shakespeare Festival at the Vivian Beaumont Theatre at Lincoln Center.  Additional information regarding the production\, including cast list\, can be found at the Internet Broadway Database's listing for this revival at http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=3835 ...  As of June 2007\, this cast album has not been released or reissued on CD; it was originally made available in 1976 on LP\, and this is an LP transfer.  As such\, the quality is not CD quality  - there will occasionally be noise\, popping\, or hissing.

Mastered at Project One Mastering.  ------------------------  "The One I Love" is a song by American rock band R.E.M.. It was released on the band's fifth full-length studio album\, Document\, and also as a 7" vinyl single in 1987. The song was their first hit single\, reaching #9 in the US Billboard Hot 100\, #14 in Canada\, and later reached #16 in the UK singles chart on its UK release (1991).  The song was included in Activision's Guitar Hero World Tour and is in Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades.  The accompanying video's director was artist Robert Longo.  The director of photography was Alton Brown\, who later became a Food Network chef.  In March 2005\, Q magazine placed "The One I Love" at number 57 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks.  The song is included on R.E.M. Live.  Lyrics and meaning  Many listeners who misunderstand the song's meaning have made the song a popular radio dedication to loved ones\, relying on the main lyric\, "This one goes out to the one I love."  However\, they missed an ensuing line: "A simple prop to occupy my time"; the song was not particularly a love song.  Stipe related in 1987 to Rolling Stone\, "I've always left myself pretty open to interpretation. It's probably better that they just think it's a love song at this point."  However\, in an interview in the January 1988 issue of Musician magazine he said that the song was "incredibly violent" and "It's very clear that it's about using people over and over again".  The song contains only three verses\, which are all near identical\, with small variations each repeat of the verse. (For example "A simple prop to occupy my time"\, "Another prop has occupied my time"). The chorus consists of just the word "fire"\, repeated (with the backing vocal of "She's coming down on her own now/Coming down on her own"\, sung by Mike Mills).  Cover versions  Bush Sufjan Stevens Massacre and many more. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	1

I lay there in the sun And felt it caressing my face As I fell asleep And dreamed. I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie And that I was the star of the movie. This really blew my mind\, The fact that me\, An overfed\, long-haired\, leaping gnome\, Should be the star of a Hollywood movie. Hmm\, but there I was. I was taken to a place\, The hall of the mountain king. I stood high upon a mountain top\, Naked to the world\, In front of every kind of girl. There was long ones\, tall ones\, short ones\, brown ones\, Black ones\, round ones\, big ones\, crazy ones. Out of the middle Came a lady. She whispered in my ear Something crazy. She said\, Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl." I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back As she disappeared\, But soon she returned. In her hand was a bottle of wine\, In the other\, a glass. She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass And raised it to her lips And\, just before she drank it\, She said\, Take the wine\, take that girl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl." Take that pearl\, yeah. It's on girl\, all you gotta do is spill that wine\, spill that wine. Let me feel\, let me feel fine\, yeah\, yeah. Spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, take that pearl.

Lyrics: Beauty queen of only eighteen She had some trouble with herself He was always there to help her She always belonged to someone else  I drove for miles and miles And wound up at your door I've had you so many times but somehow I want more  I don't mind spending everyday Out on your corner in the pouring rain Look for the girl with the broken smile Ask her if she wants to stay awhile And she will be loved She will be loved  Tap on my window knock on my door I want to make you feel beautiful I know I tend to get so insecure It doesn't matter anymore  It's not always rainbows and butterflies It's compromise that moves us along\, yeah My heart is full and my door's always open You can come anytime you want  I don't mind spending everyday Out on your corner in the pouring rain Look for the girl with the broken smile Ask her if she wants to stay awhile And she will be loved And she will be loved And she will be loved And she will be loved  I know where you hide Alone in your car Know all of the things that make you who you are I know that goodbye means nothing at all Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls  Tap on my window knock on my door I want to make you feel beautiful  I don't mind spending everyday Out on your corner in the pouring rain Look for the girl with the broken smile Ask her if she wants to stay awhile And she will be loved And she will be loved And she will be loved And she will be loved  [in the background] Please don't try so hard to say goodbye Please don't try so hard to say goodbye  Yeah  I don't mind spending everyday Out on your corner in the pouring rain  Try so hard to say goodbye COL channel name VAL Klura80	0

COL performer VAL Harlan and Stanley with Orchestra	COL video title VAL Tramp\, Tramp\, Tramp\, the Boys Are Marching COL description VAL A song by George Root\, detailing the life of a Union prisoner in the Civil War.  In the prison cell I sit\, Thinking Mother dear of you\, And our bright and happy home so far away\, And the tears they fill my eyes Spite of all that I can do Though I try to cheer my comrades and be gay.  Chorus: Tramp! tramp! tramp! The boys are marching Cheer up comrades\, They will come. And beneath the starry flag We shall breathe the air again Of the free land in our own beloved home.  In the battle front we stood When their fiercest charge they made\, And they swept us off a hundred men or more; But before we reached their lines They were beaten back\, dismayed\, And we heard the cry of vict'ry o'er and o'er.  So within the prison cell We are waiting for the day That shall come to open wide the iron door; And the hollow eye grows bright And the poor heart almost gay As we think of seing home and friends once more.

Talk about a lead singer being camera shy - you only saw his face maybe 5 or 6 times during the performance. Most of the time his back was to the audience. Being that I saw them over 44 yrs ago\, the only thing that I can remember about them was that they didn't seem very tight and they still looked like they were trying to find their place. I can't recall any songs that they did\, although I do recall that two of them were blues covers." COL channel name VAL VITOR HUGO PEREIRA GOMES	0

COL title VAL Sentimental Me COL performer VAL Elvis Presley with The Jordanaires	COL video title VAL Average White Band ~ If I Ever Lose This Heaven "1975" Funk COL description VAL Their self-effacing name to the contrary\, Average White Band was anything but -- one of the few white groups to cross the color line and achieve success and credibility playing funk\, with their tight\, fiery sound also belying their Scottish heritage\, evoking American R&B hotbeds like Detroit\, Memphis\, and Philadelphia instead. Singer/bassist Alan Gorrie\, guitarists Hamish Stuart and Onnie McIntyre\, tenor saxophonist Malcolm Duncan\, keyboardist/saxophonist Roger Ball\, and drummer Robbie McIntosh comprised the original Average White Band lineup. Veterans of numerous Scottish soul and jazz groups\, they made their debut in 1973 as the opening act at Eric Clapton's Rainbow Theatre comeback gig\, soon issuing their debut LP\, Show Your Hand\, to little notice. After adopting the abbreviated moniker AWB\, a year later the band issued their self-titled sophomore effort\, topping the American pop charts with the Arif Mardin-produced instrumental "Pick Up the Pieces." The record's mammoth success was nevertheless tempered by the September 23\, 1974 death of McIntosh\, who died at a Hollywood party after overdosing on heroin.  Cut the Cake Ex-Bloodstone drummer Steve Ferrone replaced McIntosh for AWB's third album\, 1975's Cut the Cake\, which scored a Top Ten hit with its title track as well as two other chart entries\, "If I Ever Lose This Heaven" and "School Boy Crush." (Put It Where You Want It\, issued later that same year\, was simply a retitled and repackaged Show Your Hand.) With 1976's Soul Searching\, the group reclaimed the full Average White Band name\, scoring their final Top 40 hit with "Queen of My Soul." Following the live Person to Person\, they issued Benny & Us\, a collaboration with soul legend Ben E. King. However\, after subsequent outings\, including 1978's Warmer Communications\, 1979's Feel No Fret\, and 1980's Shine\, failed to recapture the energy of AWB's peak\, the group dissolved in 1982\, with Ferrone later joining Duran Duran and Stuart recording with Paul McCartney. Gorrie\, Ball\, and McIntyre reformed Average White Band in 1989\, tapping vocalist Alex Ligertwood for their comeback effort Aftershock. Oft-sampled by hip-hop producers throughout the 1990s\, the group continued touring prior to releasing Soul Tattoo in 1996. The live album\, Face to Face\, followed three years later.

In questa puntata (la seconda delle tre) propose "Il volto della vita"\, lanciato in Italia da Caterina Caselli ma già noto negli States col titolo "The Days Of Pearly Spencer". Il brano in questione è contenuto col nuovo titolo de "La sirena di Ipanema" nell'album "Vietato ai minori" terzo capitolo della trilogia cover realizzata da Ivan nell'81 (Duemila60 Italian Graffiati)\, nell'83 (Bandiera gialla) e nell'86 appunto con "Vietato ai minori".   Il Volto Della Vita  Con il corpo sono qui ma la mente mia non c'è\, corre dietro a dei ricordi e chi la ferma più. I miei occhi sono chiusi\, ma ci vedo molto bene\, son davanti ad una casa\, entro e vedo te...  Il volto della vita... Il volto dell'amore.  Rose rosse alle pareti\, giochi d'ombra sul tuo viso\, come rami le mie braccia si apron verso te. Ed ancora la mia mente non è stanca di vagare e mi porta lungo un fiume e in fondo vedo te.  Il volto della vita... Il volto dell'amore...  Sei vestito un poco strano ma d'altronde\, come sempre\, il mio cuore ti fa festa\, sono a un passo da te. Ma qualcuno ha bussato e il mio viaggio è terminato\, io mi alzo per aprire\, apro e vedo te...  Il volto della vita... Il volto dell'amore... Il volto della vita...

The english lyrics (well known by the classic Leonard Cohen cover) were written by Hy Zaret.  Bertrand Cantat of Noir Desir provides some french vocals...  LYRICS When they poured across the border I was cautioned to surrender\, this I could not do; I took my gun and vanished.  I have changed my name so often\, I've lost my wife and children but I have many friends\, and some of them are with me.  An old woman gave us shelter\, Kept us hidden in the garret\, then the soldiers came; she died without a whisper.  There were three of us this morning I'm the only one this evening but I must go on; the frontiers are my prison.  Oh\, the wind\, the wind is blowing\, through the graves the wind is blowing\, freedom soon will come; then we'll come from the shadows.  Les Allemands étaient chez moi\, ils me dirent\, "Résigne toi\," mais je n'ai pas peur; j'ai repris mon âme.  (The Germans were at my home They said\, "Sign yourself\," But I am not afraid I have retaken my soul.)  J'ai changé cent fois de nom\, j'ai perdu femme et enfants mais j'ai tant d'amis; j'ai la France entière.  (I've changed names a hundred times I have lost wife and children But I have so many friends I have all of France)  Un vieil homme dans un grenier pour la nuit nous a caché\, les Allemands l'ont pris; il est mort sans surprise.  (An old man\, in an attic Hid us for the night The Germans captured him He died without surprise.)  Oh\, the wind\, the wind is blowing\, through the graves the wind is blowing\, freedom soon will come; then we'll come from the shadows. COL channel name VAL TinderNikos	0

Parker acquired the nickname "Yardbird" early in his career and the shortened form\, "Bird"\, which continued to be used for the rest of his life\, inspired the titles of a number of Parker compositions\, such as "Yardbird Suite"\, "Ornithology"\, "Bird Gets the Worm"\, and "Bird of Paradise." Parker was a highly influential jazz soloist and a leading figure in the development of bebop\, a form of jazz characterized by fast tempos\, virtuosic technique\, and improvisation. Parker introduced revolutionary harmonic ideas\, including rapid passing chords\, new variants of altered chords\, and chord substitutions. His tone ranged from clean and penetrating to sweet and somber. Many Parker recordings demonstrate virtuosic technique and complex melodic lines\, sometimes combining jazz with other musical genres\, including blues\, Latin\, and classical. Parker was an icon for the hipster subculture and later the Beat Generation\, personifying the jazz musician as an uncompromising artist and intellectual\, rather than an entertainer... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Parker   A link to this wonderful artist's personal website: http://www.cmgww.com/music/parker/home.html   Please Enjoy!

The edition of TotP this clip hails from is currently missing from the BBC archives. The clip only survives because it was featured on Australian ABC show GTK (Get To Know) in 1974. The GTK programme was retained in the ABC archives as a B&W 16mm kinescope\, hence the less-than-perfect quality. It has subsequently been aired on music show Rage. A copy has now been returned to the BBC.  The clip has been restored and the soundtrack replaced with the record version for audio clarity (Cassidy was miming in the clip anyway).

In the prison cell I sit\, Thinking Mother dear of you\, And our bright and happy home so far away\, And the tears they fill my eyes Spite of all that I can do Though I try to cheer my comrades and be gay.  Chorus: Tramp! tramp! tramp! The boys are marching Cheer up comrades\, They will come. And beneath the starry flag We shall breathe the air again Of the free land in our own beloved home.  In the battle front we stood When their fiercest charge they made\, And they swept us off a hundred men or more; But before we reached their lines They were beaten back\, dismayed\, And we heard the cry of vict'ry o'er and o'er.  So within the prison cell We are waiting for the day That shall come to open wide the iron door; And the hollow eye grows bright And the poor heart almost gay As we think of seing home and friends once more.

COL title VAL Cuban Love Song COL performer VAL Herbie Mann	COL video title VAL The Easy Riders -- South Coast COL description VAL The Easy Riders were an American folk music band\, that operated from 1956 to 1959\, consisting of Terry Gilkyson\, Richard Dehr\, and Frank Miller. Their career was guided by Mitch Miller\, who had them under contract for Columbia Records. Their greatest hit\, in early 1957\, was the song "Marianne". The group also composed some tunes for the 1958 cinemiracle-documentaryWindjammer\, such as "Kari Waits for Me" and "Sugar Cane". One of Gilkyson's songs was a number one hit for Frankie Laine\, "The Cry of the Wild Goose". Gilkyson wrote many tunes for Laine\, and he and The Easy Riders were also featured on Frankie's 1957 hit\, "Love Is a Golden Ring"\, having also penned the number for Laine.  Many songs of the group became better known through the interpretation of other singers\, such as the Kingston Trio\, Gale Storm\, Harry Belafonte\, Doris Day\, Burl Ives and the The Brothers Four. Their song "Memories Are Made of This" became a top hit through the interpretation by Dean Martin. After the Easy Riders made a single with the 1927 song "Tell The Captain"\, the Beach Boys adapted it and made of it their hit "Sloop John B". Gilkyson left the group in the early 1960s to work for Disney studios and wrote the Oscar-nominated "The Bear Necessities" for Disney's The Jungle Book.

COL title VAL The Only Living Boy in New York COL performer VAL Everything But the Girl	COL video title VAL The Easy Riders -- South Coast COL description VAL The Easy Riders were an American folk music band\, that operated from 1956 to 1959\, consisting of Terry Gilkyson\, Richard Dehr\, and Frank Miller. Their career was guided by Mitch Miller\, who had them under contract for Columbia Records. Their greatest hit\, in early 1957\, was the song "Marianne". The group also composed some tunes for the 1958 cinemiracle-documentaryWindjammer\, such as "Kari Waits for Me" and "Sugar Cane". One of Gilkyson's songs was a number one hit for Frankie Laine\, "The Cry of the Wild Goose". Gilkyson wrote many tunes for Laine\, and he and The Easy Riders were also featured on Frankie's 1957 hit\, "Love Is a Golden Ring"\, having also penned the number for Laine.  Many songs of the group became better known through the interpretation of other singers\, such as the Kingston Trio\, Gale Storm\, Harry Belafonte\, Doris Day\, Burl Ives and the The Brothers Four. Their song "Memories Are Made of This" became a top hit through the interpretation by Dean Martin. After the Easy Riders made a single with the 1927 song "Tell The Captain"\, the Beach Boys adapted it and made of it their hit "Sloop John B". Gilkyson left the group in the early 1960s to work for Disney studios and wrote the Oscar-nominated "The Bear Necessities" for Disney's The Jungle Book.

Joey DeFrancesco Composed: Sam Jones Cd: "Like That"\, Recording Date: August 30\, 1995 - August 31\, 1995  Release Date: April 30\, 1996   Subscribe Here: http://www.youtube.com/user/TheSouLighting http://www.facebook.com/thesoulighting  Jimmy Bruno\, born July 22\, 1953 in Philadelphia\, Pennsylvania\, is a master jazz guitarist and jazz educator. He started playing at the age of 7. He began his professional career at the age of 19\, touring with Buddy Rich. Among his many credits\, he is the only guitarist to have ever led Frank Sinatra's band. He played for many years in Los Angeles before returning to the Philadelphia area. He counts Johnny Smith\, Hank Garland\, Joe Pass\, Tal Farlow\, Wes Montgomery\, Howard Roberts\, Jim Hall\, and Pat Martino amongst his influences. In March\, 2011 Jimmy opened up Jimmy Bruno's Guitar Workshop\, a website that allows students to learn directly from Jimmy through video lessons.  For more information: http://jimmybruno.com/biography.php  Although Like That was recorded in New York\, many of the people involved with the project were Philadelphians. The pleasing hard bop date unites Jimmy Bruno's Philly-based trio of the 1990s (which includes bassist Craig Thomas and drummer Steve Holloway) with organist/trumpeter and Philly native Joey DeFrancesco\, Although DeFrancesco plays organ on most of the 11 songs\, he switches to the trumpet and favors a Miles Davis-influenced mute on relaxed versions of "There Is No Greater Love" and "Stars Fell on Alabama."   Ο Jimmy Bruno γεννήθηκε στις 22 Ιουλίου 1953\, στην Πενσυλβάνια και είναι ένας Αμερικανός master κιθαρίστας και διδάσκαλος της τζαζ. Παίζει από ηλικία 7 ετών και ξεκίνησε την επαγγελματική του καριέρα στην ηλικία των 19\, περιοδεύοντας με τον Buddy Rich. Μεταξύ των πολλών του διακρίσεων\, είναι ότι ήταν ο μόνος επικεφαλής κιθαρίστας της μπάντας του Frank Sinatra. Έπαιξε για πολλά χρόνια στο Λος Άντζελες πριν από την επιστροφή στην  Φιλαδέλφεια. Έχει επηρεαστεί\, μεταξύ άλλων\, από τους  Johnny Smith\, Hank Garland\, Joe Pass\, Tal Farlow\, Wes Montgomery\, Howard Roberts\, Jim Hall\, and Pat Martino. Από τον Μάρτιο του 2011\, άνοιξε την ιστοσελίδα: Jimmy Bruno's Guitar Workshop\,  που επιτρέπει στους μαθητές του να εξασκηθούν απευθείας από τον Bruno μέσω βίντεο μαθημάτων. Περισσότερες πληροφορίες: http://jimmybruno.com/biography.php  Το μουσικό κομμάτι “Unit Seven” είναι το από το cd του 1996 με τίτλο “Like That”\, που ηχογραφήθηκε στη Νέα Υόρκη και οι περισσότεροι μουσικοί ήταν από την Φιλαδέλφεια. Στο βασικό του τρίο (με μπάσσο τον Craig Thomas και ντράμμερ τον Steve Holloway) της περιόδου του 1990\, προστέθηκε ο  οργανίστας/τρομπετίστας Joey DeFrancesco (επίσης από την Φιλαδέλφεια).  Ο Joey DeFrancesco παίζει όργανο στα περισσότερα από τα 11 κομμάτια\, αλλά και τρομπέτα βαθειά επηρεασμένος από τον τρόπο του Miles Davis (κυρίως στα "There Is No Greater Love" και "Stars Fell on Alabama.")

Another Girl Another Planet is featured on The Coal Porters new album\, No. 6. No. 6\, is produced by John Wood\, the legendary British folk-rock mastermind who recorded the classic albums of Fairport Convention\, Nick Drake\, Beth Orton and Squeeze. No. 6 is a bit of a departure for the Coal Porters as it pushes their musical boundaries further than ever before.The Coal Porters - No. 6  https://thecoalporters.com / https://thecoalporters.bandcamp.com / https://www.facebook.com/thecoalporters  This new album features Kerenza quadruple tracking herself into a string quartet\, Andrew on a ukulele\, Sid on trusty autoharp and mandolin\, both Neil and Paul on dobro\, a Byrdsy acoustic 12-string guitar\, and very emotional\, long\, sweet trumpet solo by Cuba’s noted “son y mambo” music virtuoso Eikel Venegas. There has never been music like this before. And already\, the album’s opening track\, Sid’s “The Day The Last Ramone Died\,” is being hailed as a classic.  Recorded in two creative bursts in late 2014 and in 2015 this is the Coal Porters album which took three years to incubate. Four new Sid songs\, three new Neil Bob Herd originals\, and Kerenza Peacock contributed her first recorded lead vocal on a very personal song with Play A Tune while also gracing the record with a totally catchy instrumental\, Chopping The Garlic. The album goes out on a high note with the band’s warm-hearted cover of the Only Ones’ classic hit Another Girl\, Another Planet.  No.6 was released in September 2016 and can be ordered via Amazon\, iTunes\, the Sid Griffin website and in all good records stores.  Read more about No. 6 at http://www.sidgriffin.com/2016/09/06/the-coal-porters-no-6/  The Coal Porters are also on facebook at http://www.facebook.com/The-Coal-Porters COL channel name VAL The Coal Porters	0

COL title VAL Elastic Heart COL performer VAL Noah ft. Laura Dreyfuss	COL video title VAL 'With my eyes wide open I'm dreaming'--Patti Page 'Quartet' (1949) COL description VAL Recorded in November 1949\, this is a classic example of 'multiple' recording\, as opposed to multitrack recording.  At the time this record was made there were no multitrack tape recorders.  In fact\, the studio this was recorded at (most likely Reeves in New York City) had yet to acquire tape equipment; hence\, this recording was made by first recording part of the music on one lacquer disc\, then playing this disc back through a mixer while another part was played or sung live along with the playback\, the mix of these parts being then recorded onto a second lacquer disc.  This was done four times (original recording plus three overdubs) to produce the four vocal parts heard on this record.   Les Paul was the first to produce successful 'multiples' (as he called them)\, both technically and artistically\, and what his label Capitol nicknamed 'The New Sound' spawned a brief fad where other performers tried to mimic his recording technique on their records\, with varying degrees of success.  This record was one of the better ones\, and Patti Page had several hits with this type of sound. COL channel name VAL PerisphereRec	0

The song was the band's first single\, released in August 1979\, and is often considered to be the first gothic rock record released. It did not enter the UK pop charts at that time. The b-side features the song "Boys" and some versions also include an early demo recording of what would be their next single\, "Dark Entries". It was released on CD in 1988 and was compiled on the 1998 album\, Crackle - The Best of Bauhaus. The original sleeve art was taken from a still of the film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.  Recording session  "Bela Lugosi's Dead" was recorded during a six-hour session at Beck Studios in Wellingborough on 26 January 1979. Four more songs were recorded ("Boys"\, "Harry"\, "Dark Entries" and the unreleased "Some Faces") but not used; only "Harry" surfaced in 1982 as a single B-side to "Kick In The Eye".  The song "Boys" was re-recorded at Beck Studios in spring 1979.  Use in film and television  The song was featured in the 1983 Tony Scott cult vampire film The Hunger\, with Bauhaus portraying a band in a nightclub\, playing it during the opening credits and introduction. A 7" promotional record featuring an edited version of the song was released to theaters playing the movie.  It was also played throughout the movie Dead Man's Curve/The Curve\, and featured in the French movie\, Sombre. The song is played in the movie Good Luck Chuck as an introduction for when the Goth girl is on screen and it is on the soundtrack.  The song was used as the intro music for the late 1990s Saturday Night Live skit "Goth Talk"\, which had Chris Kattan and Molly Shannon as two goth students. This song was also in an episode in the fifth season of Smallville\, the vampire/Halloween-themed "Thirst". The song was also in an episode of One Tree Hill.  The song was featured in an episode ("Midnight") of the science fiction/horror series Fringe which revolved around a vampire-esque creature.  Comedian and musician Bill Bailey parodied the song on his DVD Cosmic Jam as part of a medley in which he and his band\, the Stan Ellis Experiment performed Cockney Rock style versions of popular songs - this particular segment of the medley included lyrical changes such as "E ad a girl's name".  The song was played almost in its entirety during the horror film The Collector during a scene in which the older daughter was attempting to have sex with her boyfriend before they were both viciously murdered.  The song was played in the opening scene of the Supernatural television series in season 6\, episode 5\, "Live Free or Twi-Hard". The episode is vampire-themed\, poking particular fun at the Twilight movie series and its romanticism of vampires.  The Illuminoids made a mash-up called Lugosi's Mongoloid Loser with Bela Lugosi's Dead by Bauhaus\, Loser by Beck and Mongolid By Devo.  Ethan Gold also covered it. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

Thus Bessie Jones's dramatic dialogue between Death and the reluctant sinner might just as well have its roots in an African tradition as in the popular religious poems and dramas of medieval Europe in which death was so frequently personified. Chorus O Death in the mornin'\, (3 times) Spare me over another year. Well\, Death walked up into the sinner's gaze\, Says\, "B'lieve you have waited now a little too late\, Your fever now is one hundred and two\, Have a narrow chance if you ever pull through." (Chorus) He cried\, "O Death\," Cryin'\, "O Death in the mornin'\, O Death\, Death\, spare me over in another year. Hey\, what is this I see\, Cold\, icy hands all over me? You say\, "I am Death\, no one can excel\, I span the doors of Death and Hell." (Chorus) 11 "No\, you heard God's people sing and pray\, You would not heed\, you just walked away\, You would not even bend your knee\, Now you got to come and go with me. (Chorus) "Well\, I'm gon' fix your feet so you cannot walk\, 'M fix your tongue where you cannot talk\, Close your eyes and you cannot see\, And you got to come and go with me." (Chorus) "Well\, Death\, consider my age\, And do not take me in this stage\, Because all of my wealth is at your command\, If you'll just move your cold\, icy hand." (Chorus) He cried\, "No no\, O Death in the mornin'\, No no\, Lord\, spare me over in another year."  - Alan Lomax COL channel name VAL TheBWJohnson	0

COL title VAL Ces petits riens COL performer VAL Jane Birkin	COL video title VAL Harpers Bizarre - Witchi Tai To COL description VAL Harpers Bizarre 4 is an album by Harpers Bizarre (Warner Bros. 1969) Ry Cooder contributes on slide guitar.  the song "Witchi Tai To" by jazzman Jim Pepper was given the group's smooth harmony veneer and mock-rococo production.  Pepper\,  was of Native American descent\, from the Plains tribes of the Kaw and the Cree. He came from a family of "road men"\, the peyote priests of the Native American Church. He was also a jazz saxophonist\, playing primarily tenor sax (but also soprano sax and flute).  encouraged by friends Ornette Coleman and Don Cherry\, Pepper began experimenting with mixing Native American music and jazz\, with interesting results. "Witchi Tai To" is a prime example of that blending\, taking a peyote song he'd learned from his grandfather and putting it in a jazz setting. COL channel name VAL mojavemoog	0

This one was uploaded originally in Mar 20\, 2011 - 6\,231views)  ------------------------  "Sunday Girl" is a 1978 song written and recorded by the American group Blondie. The track was a no. 1 hit in the UK Singles Chart for three weeks in May 1979\, but despite this was not released as a single in the United States.  Song information  The song was written by Chris Stein and was the fourth single to be taken from the album\, Parallel Lines\, in the UK and most other parts of the world. The single had an unusual release in Australia\, with some dispute among fans as to whether it reached no. 1 there or failed to chart. This is because of its initial release as the lead single from Parallel Lines\, due to its being reminiscent of "In The Flesh"\, Blondie's first hit in Australia. "Sunday Girl" failed to chart\, however\, and was later re-released as a double A-side with "Heart of Glass"\, on the back of its UK success. As a result\, it was eclipsed by the disco track\, and is rarely recognised as having charted in its own right.  A French-language version of the track was released in the UK on the "Sunday Girl" 12" single; in France and the Netherlands\, it was the B-side of the 7". It also appears on the cassette release of Eat to the Beat. For Blondie's first greatest hits album The Best of Blondie in 1981\, producer Mike Chapman created a special mix which incorporated one verse sung in French. The bilingual version appears on the 2002 compilation Greatest Hits.  In 2010 a remake of this song was made by the English performer Florrie. It had slightly different lyrics and was used for a Nina Ricci perfume commercial. The song was covered in 2013 by the band She & Him on the album Volume 3.  In 2013 Blondie themselves re-recorded the song and offered it to be included in the CBGB's film soundtrack. This version was included on their 2014 compilation album Greatest Hits Deluxe Redux. The compilation was part of a 2-disc set called Blondie 4(0) Ever which included their 10th studio album Ghosts of Download and marked the 40th anniversary of the forming of the band.

Vocals\, Bass - Spook Guitar - Kecks Sabopharge Drums - Vic 'Fontaine' Greener  Engineer - Kevin Ridley Producer - Kevin Ridley\, Spook And The Ghouls  Recorded at Impulse Studios\, Wallsend.  ------------------------  "Bela Lugosi's Dead" is a gothic rock song written by the band Bauhaus. The song was the band's first single\, released in August 1979\, and is often considered to be the first gothic rock record released. It did not enter the UK pop charts at that time. The b-side features the song "Boys" and some versions also include an early demo recording of what would be their next single\, "Dark Entries". It was released on CD in 1988 and was compiled on the 1998 album\, Crackle - The Best of Bauhaus. The original sleeve art was taken from a still of the film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.  Recording session  "Bela Lugosi's Dead" was recorded during a six-hour session at Beck Studios in Wellingborough on 26 January 1979. Four more songs were recorded ("Boys"\, "Harry"\, "Dark Entries" and the unreleased "Some Faces") but not used; only "Harry" surfaced in 1982 as a single B-side to "Kick In The Eye".  The song "Boys" was re-recorded at Beck Studios in spring 1979.  Use in film and television  The song was featured in the 1983 Tony Scott cult vampire film The Hunger\, with Bauhaus portraying a band in a nightclub\, playing it during the opening credits and introduction. A 7" promotional record featuring an edited version of the song was released to theaters playing the movie.  It was also played throughout the movie Dead Man's Curve/The Curve\, and featured in the French movie\, Sombre. The song is played in the movie Good Luck Chuck as an introduction for when the Goth girl is on screen and it is on the soundtrack.  The song was used as the intro music for the late 1990s Saturday Night Live skit "Goth Talk"\, which had Chris Kattan and Molly Shannon as two goth students. This song was also in an episode in the fifth season of Smallville\, the vampire/Halloween-themed "Thirst". The song was also in an episode of One Tree Hill.  The song was featured in an episode ("Midnight") of the science fiction/horror series Fringe which revolved around a vampire-esque creature.  Comedian and musician Bill Bailey parodied the song on his DVD Cosmic Jam as part of a medley in which he and his band\, the Stan Ellis Experiment performed Cockney Rock style versions of popular songs - this particular segment of the medley included lyrical changes such as "E ad a girl's name".  The song was played almost in its entirety during the horror film The Collector during a scene in which the older daughter was attempting to have sex with her boyfriend before they were both viciously murdered.  The song was played in the opening scene of the Supernatural television series in season 6\, episode 5\, "Live Free or Twi-Hard". The episode is vampire-themed\, poking particular fun at the Twilight movie series and its romanticism of vampires.  The Illuminoids made a mash-up called Lugosi's Mongoloid Loser with Bela Lugosi's Dead by Bauhaus\, Loser by Beck and Mongolid By Devo.  Ethan Gold also covered it. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

COL title VAL Photograph COL performer VAL 2W	COL video title VAL Huey "Piano" Smith - High Blood Pressure COL description VAL Huey "Piano" Smith was an important part of the great New Orleans piano tradition\, following in the footsteps of Professor Longhair and Fats Domino to take his place among the Crescent City's R&B elite. He was also one of R&B's great comedians\, his best singles matching the Coasters for genial\, good-time humor\, although his taste often ran more towards nonsense lyrics. Smith's sound was too earthy to match the pop crossover appeal of Domino or the Coasters\, which limited his exposure\, and he couldn't match the latter's amazing consistency\, lacking their reliable supply of material. But at the peak of his game\, Smith epitomized New Orleans R&B at its most infectious and rollicking\, as showcased on his classic signature tune "Rockin' Pneumonia and the Boogie Woogie Flu."   Huey Smith was born in New Orleans on January 26\, 1934\, and began playing the piano at age 15. At the dawn of the '50s\, Smith backed New Orleans guitar legends Earl King and Guitar Slim\, and quickly became a popular session pianist\, playing on records by the cream of the New Orleans R&B scene: Smiley Lewis (the classic "I Hear You Knockin'")\, Lloyd Price\, and Little Richard. During the mid-'50s\, Smith began leading his own band\, the Clowns\, which usually featured popular local blues singer and female impersonator Bobby Marchan on lead vocals. Smith & the Clowns signed with the Ace label and scored a breakout Top Five R&B hit in 1957 with "Rockin' Pneumonia and the Boogie Woogie Flu\," which despite becoming a classic rock & roll standard didn't even make the pop Top 40\, thanks to reticent white radio programmers. The following year\, Smith scored his biggest hit with the double-sided smash "Don't You Just Know It"/"High Blood Pressure\," which reached the pop Top Ten and the R&B Top Five. In 1959\, Smith cut the original tune "Sea Cruise\," and seeking pop radio airplay\, Ace had white teenage R&B singer Frankie Ford overdub his own vocal onto Smith's backing track; the result became a nationwide hit.   Smith cut a few novelty numbers in an attempt to duplicate the success of "Rockin' Pneumonia\," some even using the same type of illness joke ("Tu-Ber-Cu-Lucas and the Sinus Blues\," for example). It didn't work\, and Marchan left the Clowns after scoring a solo hit with "There Is Something on Your Mind" in 1960; he was replaced by female singer Gerry Hall and male vocalist Curley Moore. Smith switched briefly to the Imperial label\, then returned to Ace for one last chart single in 1962\, "Pop Eye." Smith spent part of the '60s recording for Instant and touring not only with the Clowns\, but alternate groups the Hueys and the Pitter Pats as well. Unable to return to the charts\, he eventually converted to the Jehovah's Witnesses and left the music industry permanently. ~ Steve Huey\, All Music Guide  PLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels\, Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

COL title VAL Lonely This Christmas COL performer VAL John Holt	COL video title VAL LUTHER INGRAM-ain't hat loving you(for more reason than one) COL description VAL Born Luther Thomas Ingram in Jackson\, Tennessee\, his early interest in music led to him making his first record in 1965 at the age of 28. His first three recordings failed to chart but that changed when he signed for KoKo Records in the late 1960s\, and his first hit "My Honey And Me" peaked at #55 on the Hot 100 on 14 February 1970. Many of his songs appeared in the pop and R&B charts\, even though Koko was only a small label\, owned by his manager and record producer\, Johnny Baylor. Koko and Baylor were closely associated with the Memphis based Stax Records label during the height of its commercial success.   Ingram is best known for the hit\, "(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want to Be Right"\, written by Homer Banks\, Carl Hampton and Raymond Jackson. The song reached number one on Billboard 's R&B chart and peaked at number three on that publication's Hot 100 chart in the summer of 1972. The track stayed in the Hot 100 for 18 weeks\, ultimately selling a reported four million copies.[1] The song was later successfully covered by Millie Jackson and Barbara Mandrell; it has also been recorded by Bobby "Blue" Bland\, Rod Stewart and Isaac Hayes.   Other popular tracks for Ingram included "Ain't That Loving You (For More Reasons Than One)"\, "Let's Steal Away To The Hideaway" and "I'll Be Your Shelter." He also co-authored "Respect Yourself"\, a million seller for the Staples Singers in 1971.[1] The acetate demo version of Ingram's\, "Exus Trek"\, became a sought after Northern soul track.[2] With the Stax connections\, Ingram recorded at the Memphis label's studios\, as well as other southern-based studios such as Muscle Shoals. He was opening act for Isaac Hayes for some years\, and often used Hayes' Movement band and female backing group for his 1970s recordings. He recorded into the 1980s\, and whilst only managing lower R&B chart hits\, he remained a popular stage draw.   Ingram died on March 19\, 2007\, at a Belleville\, Illinois\, hospital of heart failure. According to his wife Jacqui Ingram\, he had suffered for years from diabetes\, kidney disease and partial blindness COL channel name VAL pieroangelo2	0

COL title VAL Bring Me Sunshine COL performer VAL Brenda Lee	COL video title VAL Little Birdie - Vernon Dalhart COL description VAL Recorded on September 19\, 1925 under the pseudonym of Al Craver. Dalhart was born in Jefferson\, Texas. He took his stage name from two towns\, Vernon and Dalhart in Texas\, between which he punched cattle in the 1890s. Dalhart's father\, Robert Marion Slaughter was killed by his brother-in-law\, Bob Castleberry\, when Vernon was age 10. When Vernon was 12 or 13\, the family moved from Jefferson to Dallas\, Texas. Vernon\, who already could play the jaw harp and harmonica\, received vocal training at the Dallas Conservatory of Music. He married Sadie Lee Moore-Livingston in 1901 and had two children\, a son and a daughter. Around 1910 the family moved to New York City. He found employment in a piano warehouse and took occasional singing jobs. One of his first roles was in Giacomo Puccini's opera Girl of the Golden West; following this he played the part of Ralph Rackstraw in a production of HMS Pinafore. He also played the part of Lieutenant Pinkerton in Madame Butterfly.  He saw an advertisement in the local newspaper for singers and applied\, and was auditioned by Thomas Alva Edison; he would thereafter make numerous records for Edison Records. From 1916 until 1923\, using numerous pseudonyms\, he made over 400 recordings of light classical music and early dance band vocals for various record labels. He was already an established singer when he made his first country music recordings which cemented his place in music history. Dalhart's 1924 recording of "The Wreck of the Old 97"—a classic American railroad ballad about the September 27\, 1903 derailment of Southern Railway Fast Mail train No. 97 near Danville\, Virginia—for the Victor Talking Machine Company\, became a runaway hit\, alerting the national record companies to the existence of a sizable market for country-style vocals. It became the first Southern song to become a national success. The double-sided single eventually sold more than seven million copies\, a colossal number for a mid-1920s recording. It was the best-selling single to its time\, and was the biggest-selling non-holiday record in the first 70 years of recorded music. Research by Billboard statistician Joel Whitburn determined "The Prisoner's Song" to have been a No. 1 hit for 12 weeks in 1925-26. In 1998\, "The Prisoner's Song" was honored with a Grammy Hall of Fame Award and the Recording Industry Association of America named it one of the Songs of the Century. It was the desire of the Victor Talking Machine Company to duplicate the sales success of 'Wreck/Prisoner' that led them to contract with Ralph S. Peer to go to the southern mountains in the Summer of 1927 to facilitate 'The Bristol Sessions'\, arguably the single-most important recording event in the history of country music\, where Jimmie Rodgers and the original Carter Family were first discovered\, and after which\, Peer's royalty model would become the standard of the entire recorded music industry. He recorded under a host of pseudonyms given to him by recording managers. On Grey Gull Records he often used the pseudonym Vel Veteran\, which was however also used by other singers\, including Arthur Fields (Fields also used the pseudonym "Mr. X"). It is thought that Dalhart had the most recordings of any person in history. To some\, Dalhart's Southern accent seemed artificial. In a 1918 interview Dalhart said\, "When you are born and brought up in the South your only trouble is to talk any other way...the sure 'nough Southerner talks almost like a Negro\, even when he's white. I've broken myself of the habit\, more or less\, in ordinary conversation\, but it still comes pretty easy." While some country music purists always viewed Dalhart with some suspicion because of his light opera background and a vocal style that was closer to pop than country\, he was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970\, into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1981 and into the Gennett Records Walk of Fame in 2007. Dalhart died in Bridgeport\, Connecticut in 1948 and is interred there in the Mountain Grove Cemetery. COL channel name VAL althazarr's good time oldies	0

COL title VAL Wig Wam Bam COL performer VAL The Yum Yums	COL video title VAL Uriah Heep - Lady in Black COL description VAL http://www.discogs.com/artist/Uriah+Heep http://www.myspace.com/uriaheep  Uriah Heep's by-the-books progressive heavy metal made the British band one of the most popular hard rock groups of the early '70s. Formed by vocalist David Byron and guitarist Mick Box in the late '60s\, the group went through an astonishing number of members over the next two decades — nearly 30 different musicians passed through the band over the years. Byron and Box were members of the mid-'60s rock band called the Stalkers; once that band broke up\, the duo formed another group called Spice. Spice would eventually turn into Uriah Heep in the late '60s\, once Ken Hensley (guitar\, keyboards\, vocals) and bassist Paul Newton joined the pair. Former Spice drummer Alex Napier was the band's drummer for a brief time; he was quickly replaced by Nigel Olsson. Uriah Heep released their debut album Very 'eavy...Very 'umble (called Uriah Heep in the U.S.) in 1970. After its release\, Keith Baker became the group's drummer; he recorded Salisbury\, the group's second album\, before deciding he couldn't keep up with the band's extensive touring and was replaced by Ian Clarke. Salisbury\, featuring a 16-minute title track recorded with a 26-piece orchestra\, showcased the band's more progressive tendencies. Later that year\, Ian Clarke was replaced by Lee Kerslake and Mark Clarke replaced Newton; Mark Clarke quickly left the band and Gary Thain became the group's bassist. This lineup of Uriah Heep was its most stable and popular; beginning with 1972's Demons and Wizards\, they released five albums between 1972 and 1975. After 1975\, the band's popularity began to slip. Byron left the band in 1977 and was replaced by John Lawton\, yet the group's fortunes kept declining right into the early '80s. However\, Uriah Heep soldiered on\, continuing to release albums into the '90s and 2000s. The album roster included Different World (1994)\, Sea of Light (1995)\, Sonic Origami (1998)\, and Spellbinder (1999). COL channel name VAL TheDeZyx	0

The original line-up consisted of Brian le Gassick – lead vocals\, guitar\, John Leach – lead guitar\, Willie van der Walt – bass and Ian Miller – drums. In 1962 Leach and van der Walt were replaced by Richard Crouse – guitar\, Jimmy Routledge – bass and Billy Andrews – vocals\, harmonica (Billy later became one half of the duo the “Dream Merchants” with Billy Forrest). In 1964 the Staccatos won the Transvaal Merseyside Contest\, which included a recording contract with EMI. They supported Peter and Gordon on their tour of South Africa in 1965.  In 1966 Steve Lonsdale took over the lead vocals\, and Richard Crouse married Wanda Arletti who joined the group for a tour of Zambia. In 1967 Eddie Boyle – bass\, and Ronnie Cline – organ\, joined the group. In 1968 Billy Forrest approached the group to record “Cry to me” for the film “Katrina”. This song became their biggest hit\, reaching number 1 on the South African Top 20 in 1969 and charting for a massive 38 weeks\, earning them a double gold disc.  In 1969 John Elliot – sax\, joined the group and in 1970 Ivor Black – drums and Peter Vee – lead vocals (Steve Lonsdale left for America).  This song is off the album “Come Back Silly Girl” released in 1965.  On this album the line-up was: Ian Miller (drums and group leader)\, Richard Crouse (lead guitar)\, Billy Andrews (lead vocals and harmonica)\, Jimmy Ryan (bass) and Brian le Gassick (rhythm guitar).

Lo que atrae de los covers como siempre e dicho\, es la curiosidad de como se escucha tal cancion con tal vocalista\, el morbo de escuchar una cancion tocada por diferentes personas.  Para disfrutar de este recopilatoria\, tienes que quitarte la imagen de como es la cancion\, no esperes algo igual o "muy parecido"\, recordemos que cada musico aporta algo que hace unica cualquier cancion\, ya sea un cover como es este caso.  Como se observa en la track list\, hay una gran variedad de musicos\, entre ellos vi a Paul Di'anno\, que como todos saben fue ex-integrante de Iron Maiden\, no podian faltar Lemmy o Ripper\, tambien veo a chuck de testament\, tambien esta Chris Jericho de WWE que la neta yo ni sabia que tenia una banda.  En fin hay para todos los gustos\, lo unico malo que vi en el disco es que faltaron algunos temas. COL channel name VAL el juanito	1

Harry reportedly told arranger Jimmy Haskell that "My Mother told me someday I'd have a day like this!" Nonetheless\, Harry plays some of his most passionate trumpet on this album. This song\, "Cimarron" was a routine western-swing\, country song done by several country and western artists. But Harry James plays it as a lightning quick exhibition of his bravado style. Proving that in 1966\, Harry James could still play anything. COL channel name VAL Chuck Par-Due	0

The song was the band's first single\, released in August 1979\, and is often considered to be the first gothic rock record released. It did not enter the UK pop charts at that time. The b-side features the song "Boys" and some versions also include an early demo recording of what would be their next single\, "Dark Entries". It was released on CD in 1988 and was compiled on the 1998 album\, Crackle - The Best of Bauhaus. The original sleeve art was taken from a still of the film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.  Recording session  "Bela Lugosi's Dead" was recorded during a six-hour session at Beck Studios in Wellingborough on 26 January 1979. Four more songs were recorded ("Boys"\, "Harry"\, "Dark Entries" and the unreleased "Some Faces") but not used; only "Harry" surfaced in 1982 as a single B-side to "Kick In The Eye".  The song "Boys" was re-recorded at Beck Studios in spring 1979.  Use in film and television  The song was featured in the 1983 Tony Scott cult vampire film The Hunger\, with Bauhaus portraying a band in a nightclub\, playing it during the opening credits and introduction. A 7" promotional record featuring an edited version of the song was released to theaters playing the movie.  It was also played throughout the movie Dead Man's Curve/The Curve\, and featured in the French movie\, Sombre. The song is played in the movie Good Luck Chuck as an introduction for when the Goth girl is on screen and it is on the soundtrack.  The song was used as the intro music for the late 1990s Saturday Night Live skit "Goth Talk"\, which had Chris Kattan and Molly Shannon as two goth students. This song was also in an episode in the fifth season of Smallville\, the vampire/Halloween-themed "Thirst". The song was also in an episode of One Tree Hill.  The song was featured in an episode ("Midnight") of the science fiction/horror series Fringe which revolved around a vampire-esque creature.  Comedian and musician Bill Bailey parodied the song on his DVD Cosmic Jam as part of a medley in which he and his band\, the Stan Ellis Experiment performed Cockney Rock style versions of popular songs - this particular segment of the medley included lyrical changes such as "E ad a girl's name".  The song was played almost in its entirety during the horror film The Collector during a scene in which the older daughter was attempting to have sex with her boyfriend before they were both viciously murdered.  The song was played in the opening scene of the Supernatural television series in season 6\, episode 5\, "Live Free or Twi-Hard". The episode is vampire-themed\, poking particular fun at the Twilight movie series and its romanticism of vampires.  The Illuminoids made a mash-up called Lugosi's Mongoloid Loser with Bela Lugosi's Dead by Bauhaus\, Loser by Beck and Mongolid By Devo.  Ethan Gold also covered it. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

Link below COL description VAL https://youtu.be/gVrCs58PNUU This is a much better HD copy of the music\, plus Stay a Little Longer.  Westenr Swing music from the 1940s.  This has Noel Boggs on Steel\, which means after the war probably 1946. Alex Beshear on trumpet plays it without a mute.  That was quite unusual for him.  Also Tommy sings it.  When Bob made the Okey 78\, the vocalist was Danny Alguire\, who also played trumpet.  Tommy had joined the army when that session took play. So here we get to hear the way he would have done it.  Just wish the quality was better.  Notice the accordian?  Bob never used one in his recordings\, and I have to wonder where Noel plugged in his steel guitar.  Behind a tree?  Hot session\, though.

How can one dislike it??  ... this is from Johnny Cash's Christmas Show 1978  You can see it in their eyes - lots of desperation and scepsis\, though also still love and hope - it had already been over at the end of 1978... That's what Rita said about their divorce http://youtu.be/RCIeqw1gCUQ   I also love Kris'  demo version from (ca) 1970 which is in my uploads too http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdKFnDd1ocE  Kris today sings this song in the finale of his solo concerts - either this one is the last song\, or it is Why me...  Please don't tell me how the story ends (1970)  This could be our last good night together We may never pass this way again. Just let me enjoy it 'til it's over\, or forever  Please don't tell me how the story ends.  See the way our shadows come together Softer than your fingers on my skin Someday these may be all we remember of each other Please don't tell me how the story ends.  Never's just the echo of forever Lonesome as a love that might have been. Let me go on lovin' and believin' 'til it's over Please don't tell me how the story ends. COL channel name VAL biggestkkfan	0

COL title VAL All I've Got to Do COL performer VAL Louise Goffin	COL video title VAL Bob Wills & His Texas Playboys - Yearning Just for You (1938) COL description VAL Bob Wills was the driving force behind Western Swing\, a form of Country & Western that fuses Jazz\, Hillbilly\, Blues\, Big Band Swing\, and many more rhythm forms together creating a  truly Unique\, Diverse and Unforgettable sound. Wills' shrewd mix of horns\, fiddles and steel guitar made for a swinging sound that grabbed the public's ear during the mid 1930s and 1940s. Bob Wills was born into a family of fiddlers on March 6\, 1905. His father\, John Wills  regularly won Texas fiddling competitions. Bob learned how to play fiddle and mandolin from his father. As a young man\, Wills performed at house dances\, medicine shows and in 1929 made his debut on the radio.  With commercial sponsorship\, Wills' bands performed on radio in the early 1930s as "Aladdin's Laddies" (for the Aladdin Lamp Co.) and "The Light Crust Doughboys" (for Light Crust Flour). Following a salary dispute\, Wills renamed his band the Texas Playboys and relocated to Tulsa\, Oklahoma\, where he had a live radio show. This exposure led to a contract with the American Recording Corporation - later absorbed into Columbia Records. In September 1935\, Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys recorded their first songs in a makeshift  recording studio in an old Dallas Warehouse. From that point on\, The Texas Playboys became an overnight sensation and recorded prolifically and made such classics as "Steel Guitar Rag"\, "Maiden's Prayer"\, "Take Me Back to Tulsa" and Wills' signature song\, "San Antonio Rose".  Their biggest hit\, was "New Spanish Two Step"\, which topped the country charts for 16 weeks in 1946. The Texas Playboys always had fine singers like Tommy Duncan and Leon McAuliffe\, and Wills punctuated the tunes with jive talking\, falsetto asides and cries of "Ah-ha!" He'd call out soloists by name and instrument\, good-naturedly goading them on to rollicking solo performances. In terms of personnel\, The Texas Playboys expanded and contracted over the years\, according to Wills' desires and the whims of the market. At one point the Texas Playboys were 22 pieces strong\, although the band more typically numbered between 9 and 18 members. There were personnel changes and musical shifts as Wills struggled to adapt to the changing face of  America in the postwar era. Nonetheless\, there was always a solid core of loyal regulars in The Texas Playboys. After leaving Columbia in 1947\, Wills continued to record prolifically for such labels as MGM\, Decca\, Longhorn and Kapp. The group also toured the country and often performed  at a Wills-owned dancehall in Sacramento\, California. In 1968\, Wills was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. A year later\, he suffered a debilitating stroke. There were reunions and recording sessions with many of the old Texas Playboys in 1971 and 1973. Wills' final stroke came in his sleep following the first day of a recording session in December 1973 that resulted in the double album "For the Last Time". Confined to a wheelchair\, he'd reprised his role as bandleader that day with a group of musicians that included former Texas Playboys. He never regained consciousness and died 18 months later on May 13\, 1975. Wills has been revered by such country-music legends as Waylon Jennings\, Willie Nelson\, George Straight\, and Merle Haggard who made a 1976 remake of Bob's 1941 hit "Cherokee Maiden". The contemporary Western Swing group\, Asleep at the Wheel has also cut a pair of tribute albums that have kept Wills' name before the public. Every year\, Bob Wills Day is celebrated on the last Saturday in April in Turkey\, Texas. COL channel name VAL ASACurator	0

COL title VAL Long Gone Daddy COL performer VAL Chrome Daddies	COL video title VAL Randy California / Kapt. Kopter &  The (Fabulous) Twirly Birds - Mother And Child Reunion COL description VAL Randy California (наст. имя Randy Craig Wolfe; Лос-Анджелес\, 20 февраля 1951 - 2 января 1997) был гитарист\, вокалист и автор песен рок-группы Spirit\, созданной в 1967 году. Входит в список "100 лучших гитаристов мира" по версии журнала Classic Rock. Сценический псевдоним "Рэнди Калифорния" дал ему (в 15 лет) Джими Хендрикс\, чтобы можно было отличить от другого Рэнди в тогдашней группе Хендрикса Jimmy James and the Blue Flames (второго Рэнди Хендрикс называл "Рэнди Техас"). После ухода из группы Spirit (июль 1971) Рэнди начал сольную карьеру\, подписал контракт с Epic и выпустил осенью 1972 года альбом Kapt. Kopter and the (Fabulous) Twirly Birds. Музыка - Хендриксо-подобная\, с импровизациями\, кроме того здесь на некоторых треках играет басист Noel Redding (ex-Jimi Hendrix Experience). Следует отметить\, что на этой пластинке некоторые известные музыканты записаны под псевдонимами. С Эдом Кэссиди (своим отчимом) и басистом Ларри Найтом (Larry «Fuzzy» Knight) он провёл в Европе гастроли в поддержку своей пластинки. Но не совсем удачные\, так как Калифорния оказался неважным промоутером... Трио\, кроме того\, подготовило концептуальный альбом Potatoland\, но лейбл его отверг и Калифорния на некоторое время ушёл из музыкального бизнеса\, поселившись на Гавайях.

COL title VAL Fare Thee Honey Fare Thee Well COL performer VAL Count Basie	COL video title VAL Ivan Cattaneo "Il Volto della Vita" @ "Parola Mia" - 1986 COL description VAL Ivan fu ospite per tre puntate a "Parola mia" il programma-quiz culturale condotto da Luciano Rispoli negli studi della Rai di Torino. In questa puntata (la seconda delle tre) propose "Il volto della vita"\, lanciato in Italia da Caterina Caselli ma già noto negli States col titolo "The Days Of Pearly Spencer". Il brano in questione è contenuto col nuovo titolo de "La sirena di Ipanema" nell'album "Vietato ai minori" terzo capitolo della trilogia cover realizzata da Ivan nell'81 (Duemila60 Italian Graffiati)\, nell'83 (Bandiera gialla) e nell'86 appunto con "Vietato ai minori".   Il Volto Della Vita  Con il corpo sono qui ma la mente mia non c'è\, corre dietro a dei ricordi e chi la ferma più. I miei occhi sono chiusi\, ma ci vedo molto bene\, son davanti ad una casa\, entro e vedo te...  Il volto della vita... Il volto dell'amore.  Rose rosse alle pareti\, giochi d'ombra sul tuo viso\, come rami le mie braccia si apron verso te. Ed ancora la mia mente non è stanca di vagare e mi porta lungo un fiume e in fondo vedo te.  Il volto della vita... Il volto dell'amore...  Sei vestito un poco strano ma d'altronde\, come sempre\, il mio cuore ti fa festa\, sono a un passo da te. Ma qualcuno ha bussato e il mio viaggio è terminato\, io mi alzo per aprire\, apro e vedo te...  Il volto della vita... Il volto dell'amore... Il volto della vita...

Tindley was born in 1851 and died in 1936. He wrote this number in 1905 as "We"ll Understand It Better By and By." He might have recorded the number himself\, but this can't be confirmed. Tindley also wrote the song "I'll Overcome Some Day\," which later became know as "We Shall Overcome." Furthermore\, he wrote the gospel number "Stand By Me." Many sources imply that this is the song with which Ben E. King had a hit in the 1960s\, but that was a different number. However\, Elvis also recorded Tindley's "Stand By Me" for his own "How Great Thou Art" gospel collection. Brothers Frank and James McCravy from Laurens\, South Carolina\, recorded the number as "We'll Understand It Better Bye and Bye" (note the added "e"s on the words "By") in New York in February 1925\, for release on Okeh 40319. This was the McCravy's first recording session\, but they went on to record hundreds of tracks\, often using different names\, such as The Lonesome Pine Twins\, The Austin Brothers\, Al and Joe Blackburn\, Cox and Campbell\, and The Mack Brothers. They ended their recording career in 1935\, by which time they had recorded "We'll Understand It Better Bye and Bye" on at least two more occasions.

COL title VAL T.S.O.P. (The Sound of Philadelphia) COL performer VAL MFSB	COL video title VAL Little Birdie - Vernon Dalhart COL description VAL Recorded on September 19\, 1925 under the pseudonym of Al Craver. Dalhart was born in Jefferson\, Texas. He took his stage name from two towns\, Vernon and Dalhart in Texas\, between which he punched cattle in the 1890s. Dalhart's father\, Robert Marion Slaughter was killed by his brother-in-law\, Bob Castleberry\, when Vernon was age 10. When Vernon was 12 or 13\, the family moved from Jefferson to Dallas\, Texas. Vernon\, who already could play the jaw harp and harmonica\, received vocal training at the Dallas Conservatory of Music. He married Sadie Lee Moore-Livingston in 1901 and had two children\, a son and a daughter. Around 1910 the family moved to New York City. He found employment in a piano warehouse and took occasional singing jobs. One of his first roles was in Giacomo Puccini's opera Girl of the Golden West; following this he played the part of Ralph Rackstraw in a production of HMS Pinafore. He also played the part of Lieutenant Pinkerton in Madame Butterfly.  He saw an advertisement in the local newspaper for singers and applied\, and was auditioned by Thomas Alva Edison; he would thereafter make numerous records for Edison Records. From 1916 until 1923\, using numerous pseudonyms\, he made over 400 recordings of light classical music and early dance band vocals for various record labels. He was already an established singer when he made his first country music recordings which cemented his place in music history. Dalhart's 1924 recording of "The Wreck of the Old 97"—a classic American railroad ballad about the September 27\, 1903 derailment of Southern Railway Fast Mail train No. 97 near Danville\, Virginia—for the Victor Talking Machine Company\, became a runaway hit\, alerting the national record companies to the existence of a sizable market for country-style vocals. It became the first Southern song to become a national success. The double-sided single eventually sold more than seven million copies\, a colossal number for a mid-1920s recording. It was the best-selling single to its time\, and was the biggest-selling non-holiday record in the first 70 years of recorded music. Research by Billboard statistician Joel Whitburn determined "The Prisoner's Song" to have been a No. 1 hit for 12 weeks in 1925-26. In 1998\, "The Prisoner's Song" was honored with a Grammy Hall of Fame Award and the Recording Industry Association of America named it one of the Songs of the Century. It was the desire of the Victor Talking Machine Company to duplicate the sales success of 'Wreck/Prisoner' that led them to contract with Ralph S. Peer to go to the southern mountains in the Summer of 1927 to facilitate 'The Bristol Sessions'\, arguably the single-most important recording event in the history of country music\, where Jimmie Rodgers and the original Carter Family were first discovered\, and after which\, Peer's royalty model would become the standard of the entire recorded music industry. He recorded under a host of pseudonyms given to him by recording managers. On Grey Gull Records he often used the pseudonym Vel Veteran\, which was however also used by other singers\, including Arthur Fields (Fields also used the pseudonym "Mr. X"). It is thought that Dalhart had the most recordings of any person in history. To some\, Dalhart's Southern accent seemed artificial. In a 1918 interview Dalhart said\, "When you are born and brought up in the South your only trouble is to talk any other way...the sure 'nough Southerner talks almost like a Negro\, even when he's white. I've broken myself of the habit\, more or less\, in ordinary conversation\, but it still comes pretty easy." While some country music purists always viewed Dalhart with some suspicion because of his light opera background and a vocal style that was closer to pop than country\, he was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970\, into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1981 and into the Gennett Records Walk of Fame in 2007. Dalhart died in Bridgeport\, Connecticut in 1948 and is interred there in the Mountain Grove Cemetery. COL channel name VAL althazarr's good time oldies	0

Her style was a hybrid of Brill Building-style New York pop\, jazz\, gospel\, rhythm and blues\, show tunes\, rock and soul.  She was best known\, and enjoyed her greatest commercial success\, as a composer and lyricist rather than as a performer. Between 1968 and 1970 a number of other singers had significant hits with her songs: The 5th Dimension with "Blowing Away"\, "Wedding Bell Blues"\, "Stoned Soul Picnic"\, "Sweet Blindness"\, "Save The Country" and "Black Patch"; Blood\, Sweat & Tears and Peter\, Paul & Mary with "And When I Die"; Three Dog Night with "Eli's Coming"; and Barbra Streisand with "Stoney End"\, "Time and Love"\, and "Hands off the Man (Flim Flam Man)".

Lyrics:  Loving you so I was too blind to see you letting me go But now that you've set me free It's gonna take a miracle Yes\, it's gonna take a miracle To make me love someone new Cause I'm crazy for you  Oh oh\, didn't you know It wouldn't be so easy lettin' you go I could have told you that it's gonna take a miracle  oh-uh Yes\, it's gonna take a miracle To make me love someone new Cause I'm crazy for you  Oh\, tho' I know I can't forget? about you or come so? will show you how much You're turning me around\, destroying me I'll never be the same anymore  You must realize You took your love and left me Quite by surprise You can be sure that now it's gonna take a miracle Yes\, it's gonna take a miracle To make me love someone new Cause I'm crazy for you COL channel name VAL Mr.Lotsopa	0

Another Girl Another Planet is featured on The Coal Porters new album\, No. 6. No. 6\, is produced by John Wood\, the legendary British folk-rock mastermind who recorded the classic albums of Fairport Convention\, Nick Drake\, Beth Orton and Squeeze. No. 6 is a bit of a departure for the Coal Porters as it pushes their musical boundaries further than ever before.The Coal Porters - No. 6  https://thecoalporters.com / https://thecoalporters.bandcamp.com / https://www.facebook.com/thecoalporters  This new album features Kerenza quadruple tracking herself into a string quartet\, Andrew on a ukulele\, Sid on trusty autoharp and mandolin\, both Neil and Paul on dobro\, a Byrdsy acoustic 12-string guitar\, and very emotional\, long\, sweet trumpet solo by Cuba’s noted “son y mambo” music virtuoso Eikel Venegas. There has never been music like this before. And already\, the album’s opening track\, Sid’s “The Day The Last Ramone Died\,” is being hailed as a classic.  Recorded in two creative bursts in late 2014 and in 2015 this is the Coal Porters album which took three years to incubate. Four new Sid songs\, three new Neil Bob Herd originals\, and Kerenza Peacock contributed her first recorded lead vocal on a very personal song with Play A Tune while also gracing the record with a totally catchy instrumental\, Chopping The Garlic. The album goes out on a high note with the band’s warm-hearted cover of the Only Ones’ classic hit Another Girl\, Another Planet.  No.6 was released in September 2016 and can be ordered via Amazon\, iTunes\, the Sid Griffin website and in all good records stores.

This album features the likes of Clive Langer\, Ian Broudie\, James Eller and Lee "Kix" Thompson of Madness. Bette Bright (real name Anne Martin) married Graham "Suggs" McPherson (no introduction necessary) and retired from music to start a family. Recently\, however\, she has re-emerged along with Deaf School\, playing several reunion and tribute gigs.

Classic Folk sheds new light on the success of the urban intellectual-driven movement that made rural white and African-American artists and their music favorites of audiences everywhere. This recording features classic performances by classic artists doing some of their classic songs during the great folksong revival of the 1940s through 1960s. It features some of the great performances from the vaults of Folkways Records. Compiled and annotated by Jeff Place.

COL title VAL Brand New Key COL performer VAL The Dollyrots	COL video title VAL Leslie West - Politician.wmv COL description VAL Leslie West - Got Blooze (2005) Guitar hero Leslie West has issued countless albums over the years\, mostly either as a member of Mountain or as a solo artist. But he has never set out to record an album comprised entirely of classic blues rockers. Then 2005's Got Blooze came along. While this sort of thing has been done by countless fellow veteran classic rock acts of late (the best-known of the bunch being Aerosmith's Honkin' on Bobo)\, it turns out to be custom-made for a player like West. Throughout the 12-track set\, West keeps things raw and gritty\, as evidenced by such standouts as the extraordinary "Third Degree" and a cover of the oft-overlooked Cream gem\, "Politician." West also surrounds himself with a fantastic rhythm section\, comprised of Vanilla Fudge's Tim Bogert on bass and session ace Aynsley Dunbar on drums (turns out the pair pulled double duty\, as they also backed ex-Ozzy Osbourne guitarist Jake E. Lee on an additional album full of covers\, Retraced). While we probably could have done without the umpteenth cover of "Baby Please Don't Go" (AC/DC\, Aerosmith\, Ted Nugent\, and countless others have played it over the years)\, overall\, Got Blooze is a welcome return for West\, and easily his strongest\, most focused work in quite some time.

Riding through dustclouds and barren wastes Galloping hard on the plains Chasing the redskins back to their holes Fighting them at their own game Murder for freedom a stab in the back Women and children and cowards attack  Run to the hills - run for your lives Run to the hills - run for your lives  Soldier blue on the barren wastes Hunting and killing their game Raping the women and wasting the men The only good indians are tame Selling them whisky and taking their gold Enslaving the young and destroying the old  Run to the hills - run for your lives Run to the hills - run for your lives  (Harris) COL channel name VAL andree965	0

COL title VAL I Stand Accused COL performer VAL Jimmy Hughes	COL video title VAL Gene Austin - Wedding Bells Are Breaking Up That Old Gang Of Mine 1929 COL description VAL Victor 21893 - This Song Peaked On US Music Charts At #8 In 1929 Gene Austin (June 24\, 1900 -- January 24\, 1972) was an American singer and songwriter\, one of the first "crooners". His 1920s compositions "When My Sugar Walks Down the Street" and "The Lonesome Road" became pop and jazz standards. Austin was born as Lemeul Eugene Lucas in Gainesville\, Texas (north of Dallas)\, to Nova Lucas (died 1943) and the former Serena Belle Harrell (died 1956). He took the name "Gene Austin" from his stepfather\, Jim Austin\, a blacksmith. Austin grew up in Minden\, the seat of Webster Parish in northwestern Louisiana\, located east of Shreveport. There he learned to play piano and guitar. He ran away from home at 15 and attended a vaudeville act in Houston\, Texas\, where the audience was allowed to come to the stage and sing. On a dare from his friends\, Austin took the stage and sang for the first time since singing as a Southern Baptist choir boy. The audience response was overwhelming\, and the vaudeville company immediately offered him a billed spot on their ticket. Austin joined the U.S. Army at the age of 17 in hopes of being dispatched to Europe to fight in World War I. He was first stationed in New Orleans\, where he played the piano at night in the city's notorious vice district. His familiarity with horses from helping his stepfather in his blacksmithing business also prompted the Army to assign Austin to the cavalry and send him to Mexico with General John Pershing's Pancho Villa expedition\, for which he was awarded the Mexican Service Medal. Thereafter\, he served in France in the Great War. On returning to the United States in 1919\, Austin settled in Baltimore\, Maryland\, where he intended to study dentistry. Soon\, however\, he was playing piano and singing in local taverns. He started writing songs and formed a vaudeville act with Roy Bergere\, with whom he wrote "How Come You Do Me Like You Do." The act ended when Bergere married. Austin worked briefly in a club owned by Lou Clayton\, who later was a part of the famous vaudeville team Clayton\, Jackson and Durante. Gene Austin was an important pioneer crooner whose records in their day enjoyed record sales and the highest circulation. The Genial Texan ex-vaudevillian and would-be screen idol\, Austin constitutes an underrated landmark in popular music history. He made a substantial number of influential recordings from the mid-1920s including a string of best-sellers. In 1956\, CBS made a television drama about Austin's life. In 1962\, Austin campaigned unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for governor of Nevada. He polled only 5\,017 votes (10.21 percent) to his opponent\, Grant Sawyer\, who received 40\,168 ballots (81.4 percent) Sawyer then won the governorship by a nearly 2-1 margin over weak Republican opposition in the fall campaign. Austin had retired to Palm Springs\, in the late 1950s and had been active in civic boards there until 1970. Income from his record sales allowed him to live comfortably the rest of his life. He died in Palm Springs of lung cancer and was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale\, California. He was a godfather of country singer David Houston\, who like Austin also lived in Minden\, Louisiana\, during his youth. "Wedding Bells Are Breaking Up (That Old Gang Of Mine)" is a popular barbershop song\, also known as just "That Old Gang Of Mine". The song laments the loss of childhood friendships when growing up into adulthood. The music was written by Sammy Fain and the lyrics by Irving Kahal and Willie Raskin. The song was published in 1929. COL channel name VAL warholsoup100	0

COL title VAL Steppin' Out with My Baby COL performer VAL The John Wilson Orchestra feat. Curtis Stigers	COL video title VAL LURLEAN HUNTER  Vocal Jazz Swing. Steppin' Out With My Baby \, I Feel COL description VAL Lurlean Hunter  Singer Lurlean Hunter made five albums on her own during the second half of the '50s\, starting out as a Lonesome Gal on RCA and winding up still feeling Blue & Sentimental for Atlantic. She was discovered in Chicago where she had been singing in many clubs\, including a collaboration with drummer Red Saunders that held forth at the Club DeLisa. Hunter's move to New York City in 1955 was prompted by RCA's interest in recording her. The singer's recording career actually began before she left the Windy City at the behest of indie jazz labels\, some of them quite short-lived -- such as Seymour\, with a catalog topping out at four releases. The press described Hunter as a "blues thrush" in announcing her interpretations of three numbers actually written by the label's owner\, producer and record store owner Seymour Schwartz. The latter promotional blurb inevitably told some truth about Hunter's stylistic traits\, if not her relation to winged fauna. Her recordings were more about rhythm & blues and pop than jazz\, yet were done in an era when such sessions often involved fine mainstream jazz players in the accompaniment. The 1956Night Life\, for example\, featured pianist Hank Jones and tenor saxophonist Al Cohn. Blue & Sentimental -- with arrangements by the progressive Jimmy Giuffre -- was reissued in 2000 as a split CD also including an album by fellow singer Betty Bennett\, a former wife of pianist André Previn.Hunter's final recordings were done in 1964\, at which point she was still well under 40 years old. She is known to have died young\, although details of this tragedy are murky. In one version of the story she was knocked off by a mobster lover\, yet whether anybody was really that mean to Lurlean cannot be completely confirmed.

Lo que atrae de los covers como siempre e dicho\, es la curiosidad de como se escucha tal cancion con tal vocalista\, el morbo de escuchar una cancion tocada por diferentes personas.  Para disfrutar de este recopilatoria\, tienes que quitarte la imagen de como es la cancion\, no esperes algo igual o "muy parecido"\, recordemos que cada musico aporta algo que hace unica cualquier cancion\, ya sea un cover como es este caso.  Como se observa en la track list\, hay una gran variedad de musicos\, entre ellos vi a Paul Di'anno\, que como todos saben fue ex-integrante de Iron Maiden\, no podian faltar Lemmy o Ripper\, tambien veo a chuck de testament\, tambien esta Chris Jericho de WWE que la neta yo ni sabia que tenia una banda.  En fin hay para todos los gustos\, lo unico malo que vi en el disco es que faltaron algunos temas. COL channel name VAL el juanito	0

COL title VAL Mountain High\, Valley Low COL performer VAL Mary Martin with Lute Song Orchestra under Direction of Raymond Scott	COL video title VAL Lulu Belle and Scotty - Mountain Dew (1939). COL description VAL (1928 Version Written by Bascom Lamar Lunsford...1939 Version Written by Scott Wiseman)   Lunsford was not only a folklorist but also a lawyer\, who defended clients in criminal cases involving moonshining during the 1920s in North Carolina. He wrote a ballad based on this experience and recorded it in 1928. In 1935\, his friend Scotty Wiseman added the modern chorus and replaced verses about a man appearing in court with verses about making moonshine.

COL title VAL Waltz of My Heart COL performer VAL Vanessa Lee	COL video title VAL Little Birdie - Vernon Dalhart COL description VAL Recorded on September 19\, 1925 under the pseudonym of Al Craver. Dalhart was born in Jefferson\, Texas. He took his stage name from two towns\, Vernon and Dalhart in Texas\, between which he punched cattle in the 1890s. Dalhart's father\, Robert Marion Slaughter was killed by his brother-in-law\, Bob Castleberry\, when Vernon was age 10. When Vernon was 12 or 13\, the family moved from Jefferson to Dallas\, Texas. Vernon\, who already could play the jaw harp and harmonica\, received vocal training at the Dallas Conservatory of Music. He married Sadie Lee Moore-Livingston in 1901 and had two children\, a son and a daughter. Around 1910 the family moved to New York City. He found employment in a piano warehouse and took occasional singing jobs. One of his first roles was in Giacomo Puccini's opera Girl of the Golden West; following this he played the part of Ralph Rackstraw in a production of HMS Pinafore. He also played the part of Lieutenant Pinkerton in Madame Butterfly.  He saw an advertisement in the local newspaper for singers and applied\, and was auditioned by Thomas Alva Edison; he would thereafter make numerous records for Edison Records. From 1916 until 1923\, using numerous pseudonyms\, he made over 400 recordings of light classical music and early dance band vocals for various record labels. He was already an established singer when he made his first country music recordings which cemented his place in music history. Dalhart's 1924 recording of "The Wreck of the Old 97"—a classic American railroad ballad about the September 27\, 1903 derailment of Southern Railway Fast Mail train No. 97 near Danville\, Virginia—for the Victor Talking Machine Company\, became a runaway hit\, alerting the national record companies to the existence of a sizable market for country-style vocals. It became the first Southern song to become a national success. The double-sided single eventually sold more than seven million copies\, a colossal number for a mid-1920s recording. It was the best-selling single to its time\, and was the biggest-selling non-holiday record in the first 70 years of recorded music. Research by Billboard statistician Joel Whitburn determined "The Prisoner's Song" to have been a No. 1 hit for 12 weeks in 1925-26. In 1998\, "The Prisoner's Song" was honored with a Grammy Hall of Fame Award and the Recording Industry Association of America named it one of the Songs of the Century. It was the desire of the Victor Talking Machine Company to duplicate the sales success of 'Wreck/Prisoner' that led them to contract with Ralph S. Peer to go to the southern mountains in the Summer of 1927 to facilitate 'The Bristol Sessions'\, arguably the single-most important recording event in the history of country music\, where Jimmie Rodgers and the original Carter Family were first discovered\, and after which\, Peer's royalty model would become the standard of the entire recorded music industry. He recorded under a host of pseudonyms given to him by recording managers. On Grey Gull Records he often used the pseudonym Vel Veteran\, which was however also used by other singers\, including Arthur Fields (Fields also used the pseudonym "Mr. X"). It is thought that Dalhart had the most recordings of any person in history. To some\, Dalhart's Southern accent seemed artificial. In a 1918 interview Dalhart said\, "When you are born and brought up in the South your only trouble is to talk any other way...the sure 'nough Southerner talks almost like a Negro\, even when he's white. I've broken myself of the habit\, more or less\, in ordinary conversation\, but it still comes pretty easy." While some country music purists always viewed Dalhart with some suspicion because of his light opera background and a vocal style that was closer to pop than country\, he was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970\, into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1981 and into the Gennett Records Walk of Fame in 2007. Dalhart died in Bridgeport\, Connecticut in 1948 and is interred there in the Mountain Grove Cemetery. COL channel name VAL althazarr's good time oldies	0

Song information  Written by Debbie Harry and Nigel Harrison for the band's third studio album\, Parallel Lines (1978)\, the song was inspired by one of Harry's ex-boyfriends who stalked her after their break up.  The song was released as a single in the US as the follow-up to "Heart of Glass". "One Way or Another" reached number twenty-four in the Billboard Hot 100. Although never officially released as a single in the United Kingdom and other countries\, the song remains one of the group's most popular songs worldwide. Rolling Stone ranked the song #298 on its list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.  The song was included on the US and Canadian versions of the band's first hits compilation\, The Best of Blondie (1981)\, but not on international releases. The artist of the song loves to eat shells\,blondes\, and windows.  Blondie released a manipulated live version of the song (with the audience noise removed) as the theme for the 1999 US television series Snoops. This version was released in the US as a bonus track on the US Live version of their album Livid (Live). The original un-edited live version was included on the European / non-US Livid version.  The song is featured in the films: Little Darlings (1980)\, Carpool (1996)\, Beverly Hills Ninja (1997)\, Donnie Brasco (1997)\, Coyote Ugly (2000) and Mean Girls (2004)\, as well as the television series Veronica Mars. It also plays in the end credits of the film Seed of Chucky. It is also heard in the opening moments of The A-Team episode\, "Incident at Crystal Lake".  The song is the title track for Channel 4's drama "Sugar Rush" set in Brighton that was broadcast from 2005-2006.  The song is a playable track on Rock Band 2\, Guitar Hero World Tour and Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades. The song is also featured in Driver: Parallel Lines.  This song is also featured in several 2004 Swiffer commercials.  UK singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor did a cover version for The Guru movie soundtrack in 2001.  Actress Kristen Bell did a karaoke version of this song in one episode of the TV series Veronica Mars.  Singer Mandy Moore recorded a cover for the film "Aquamarine" (2006). The song was also covered in 1998 by actress Melissa Joan Hart for an episode of her TV series\, Sabrina\, the Teenage Witch. It was released later that year on the show's soundtrack album.  In The Rugrats Movie Angelica sings her own version of the song with different lyrics (written by Eryk Casemiro)\, the soundtrack album includes a longer version of the song not heard in the movie.  Rapper G-Dep interpolates this song on his song called "One Way" on his album\, Child of the Ghetto.  Jada will perform that song from their new studio album.  Play will perform that song from their new studio album Under My Skin.  Cover versions  Full Blown Rose Sophie Ellis Bextor In The Flesh Mandy Moore The Rock Legs. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

The record was released in June 1979 on Optional Music with "The Man with the Dogs" as the b-side. The title track was re-recorded for the band's first album\, Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables (1980)\, and the version that appeared on this single\, as well as the single's b-side\, are available on the rarities album Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death (1987).  The lyrics were written by Jello Biafra and John Greenway\, and Biafra composed the music in one of his rare attempts at composing on bass.  This song was featured in the video game Tony Hawk's American Wasteland and as a downloadable song in the Rock Band series. It is also sampled in a song by the dance-punk/big beat trio The Prodigy\, "Dead Ken Beats". The song was also featured in the 2010 film The Social Network.  Meaning  The title is an allusion to the first (and no longer sung) stanza of the national anthem of Germany\, which begins with the words "Deutschland\, Deutschland über alles." (literally\, "Germany\, Germany above all.")  The song focuses on Jerry Brown\, the Governor of California 1975-1983 and 2011--present\, and is sung from his perspective. An imaginary Brown outlines a hippie-fascist vision for America\, in which his "suede denim secret police" kill un-cool people with "organic poison gas" chambers. Lines such as "Serpent's egg already hatched" (a reference to a line from William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar) comment on the corrosive nature of power. The line "now it is 1984" refers to the totalitarian regime of George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four\, describing a future (from 1979) where Jerry Brown has become President Brown presiding over secret police and gas chambers.  Cover versions  Blue Ribbon Glee Club regularly perform their version of the song.  The song was updated by The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy when they released a cover version in 1992 on the album Hypocrisy is the Greatest Legacy. They replaced references to Jerry Brown with references to Pete Wilson.  The song was also widely known in Poland (as "Kalifornia Ponad Wszystko") thanks to the cover by Polish rocker Kazik Staszewski with his band Kazik Na Żywo.  Hasidic New Wave perform a remake of the song on their 1999 album\, Kabalogy. In their version\, titled "Giuliani Über Alles"\, Jerry Brown is replaced by former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani.  The Delgados cover the song in their Peel Sessions CD set.  Six Feet Under do a cover the song on their Graveyard Classics album.  The black metal band Mayhem also covered the song.  Deceased covered the song on their punk covers album Rotten to the Core.  The hardcore band Ceremony has covered the song.  The Who Boys have done a mashup of "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" by Gil Scott-Heron called "Revolution Über Alles".  John Linnell and his band The Statesmen covered it live at least once during his "State Songs" tour\, choosing to perform it because it mentioned the state of California.  Dramarama has recorded a version\, updated in 2003 about California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger... "You will lift weights in school".  A 1986 live recording focused on Ronald Reagan on the album Mutiny On The Bay with live recordings from 1982 and 1986.  Jayne County covered the song with She Wolves about California's Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The green vinyl single was released under artist name Jayne County Meets The She Wolves by the German label Trash 2001.  Mexican death metal band Brujería covers Dead Kennedys with the song "California Uber Aztlan" in 2010. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

Wayne wrote several hits for The Box Tops\, as well as a string of hits for major country artists...and\, he co-wrote the CMA\, ACM and Grammy Award winning classic\, "Always On My Mind". Little wonder that he is a member of the Nashville Songwriters Hall Of Fame.  This track was released in Australia in 1969 as the flipside of a Monument 45\, PK3132. The A. side was Wayne's own version of the Waylon hit "(Don't Let The Sun Set On You In) Tulsa"\, which I've also uploaded to YouTube.  This upload is from the original 45.  *** If you like my channel\, why not SUBSCRIBE?

COL title VAL Papa Loves Mambo COL performer VAL Renato Carosone e il suo Quartetto	COL video title VAL THE RUFFIN BROTHERS -"LO & BEHOLD" (1970) COL description VAL With neither Ruffin brother experiencing significant success in the wake of their non-simultaneous departure from the Temptations\, Jimmy latched upon the idea of recording a duet album with the younger David -- partially as a way to pay tribute to their recently passed parents\, partially as a way to jump-start their stalled careers. In regards to the latter\, 1970's I Am My Brother's Keeper was no great shakes\, barely scraping the pop charts and its lead single "Stand by Me" only reaching 24 on the R&B charts\, but as a testament to the familial talents of the Ruffins\, the LP succeeds\, proving that these two great voices could enliven familiar tunes. It's a knack that's needed here\, for much of I Am My Brother's Keeper consists of splashy\, sequin-studded and polyester-draped covers of pop and R&B hits. Just under half of the album consists of versions of tunes by the Hollies\, Ben E. King\, the Delfonics and Tyrone Davis\, with the rest of the record coming from in-house Motown writers and elsewhere\, including the rousing Gloria Jones co-write "When My Love Hand Comes Down." This is one of five Bobby Taylor productions on the LP\, and he gives the Ruffins soulful\, funky sounds that showcase them at their best\, with Henry Cosby\, Duke Browner\, Frank Wilson and Al Kent responsible for the songs that edge a little closer to the pop charts. Combined\, all the producers provide a sampler of Motown sounds at the dawn of the '70s -- sometimes things are deeply funky\, sometimes things are slick enough for a televised variety revue -- but the Ruffins pull it all together\, sounding comfortable in every setting\, always commanding attention. Perhaps its underwhelming commercial performance is understandable -- there are no true knockouts here\, just a bunch of strong soul -- but I Am My Brother's Keeper is an album that seems stronger in retrospect\, as it was the last time one of the great brother teams in soul sung together so joyfully. [Hip-O Select's 2010 reissue adds the excellent unreleased "You're What I Need (Not What I Want)" -- produced by Bobby Taylor and co-written by Gloria Jones and Pamela Sawyer -- and a mix of "Stand by Me" that removes the fake live overdubs of the original.

He started playing at the age of 7. He began his professional career at the age of 19\, touring with Buddy Rich. Among his many credits\, he is the only guitarist to have ever led Frank Sinatra's band. He played for many years in Los Angeles before returning to the Philadelphia area. He counts Johnny Smith\, Hank Garland\, Joe Pass\, Tal Farlow\, Wes Montgomery\, Howard Roberts\, Jim Hall\, and Pat Martino amongst his influences. In March\, 2011 Jimmy opened up Jimmy Bruno's Guitar Workshop\, a website that allows students to learn directly from Jimmy through video lessons.  For more information: http://jimmybruno.com/biography.php  Although Like That was recorded in New York\, many of the people involved with the project were Philadelphians. The pleasing hard bop date unites Jimmy Bruno's Philly-based trio of the 1990s (which includes bassist Craig Thomas and drummer Steve Holloway) with organist/trumpeter and Philly native Joey DeFrancesco\, Although DeFrancesco plays organ on most of the 11 songs\, he switches to the trumpet and favors a Miles Davis-influenced mute on relaxed versions of "There Is No Greater Love" and "Stars Fell on Alabama."   Ο Jimmy Bruno γεννήθηκε στις 22 Ιουλίου 1953\, στην Πενσυλβάνια και είναι ένας Αμερικανός master κιθαρίστας και διδάσκαλος της τζαζ. Παίζει από ηλικία 7 ετών και ξεκίνησε την επαγγελματική του καριέρα στην ηλικία των 19\, περιοδεύοντας με τον Buddy Rich. Μεταξύ των πολλών του διακρίσεων\, είναι ότι ήταν ο μόνος επικεφαλής κιθαρίστας της μπάντας του Frank Sinatra. Έπαιξε για πολλά χρόνια στο Λος Άντζελες πριν από την επιστροφή στην  Φιλαδέλφεια. Έχει επηρεαστεί\, μεταξύ άλλων\, από τους  Johnny Smith\, Hank Garland\, Joe Pass\, Tal Farlow\, Wes Montgomery\, Howard Roberts\, Jim Hall\, and Pat Martino. Από τον Μάρτιο του 2011\, άνοιξε την ιστοσελίδα: Jimmy Bruno's Guitar Workshop\,  που επιτρέπει στους μαθητές του να εξασκηθούν απευθείας από τον Bruno μέσω βίντεο μαθημάτων. Περισσότερες πληροφορίες: http://jimmybruno.com/biography.php  Το μουσικό κομμάτι “Unit Seven” είναι το από το cd του 1996 με τίτλο “Like That”\, που ηχογραφήθηκε στη Νέα Υόρκη και οι περισσότεροι μουσικοί ήταν από την Φιλαδέλφεια. Στο βασικό του τρίο (με μπάσσο τον Craig Thomas και ντράμμερ τον Steve Holloway) της περιόδου του 1990\, προστέθηκε ο  οργανίστας/τρομπετίστας Joey DeFrancesco (επίσης από την Φιλαδέλφεια).  Ο Joey DeFrancesco παίζει όργανο στα περισσότερα από τα 11 κομμάτια\, αλλά και τρομπέτα βαθειά επηρεασμένος από τον τρόπο του Miles Davis (κυρίως στα "There Is No Greater Love" και "Stars Fell on Alabama.")

Williamson's first recording session took place in 1951 for Lillian McMurry of Jackson\, Mississippi's Trumpet Records\, three years after the death of John Lee Williamson\, which for the first time allowed some legitimacy to Miller's carefully worded claim to being "the one and only Sonny Boy Williamson". McMurry later erected Williamson's headstone\, near Tutwiler\, Mississippi\, in 1977. Checker Records When Trumpet went bankrupt in 1955\, Sonny Boy's recording contract was yielded to its creditors\, who sold it to Chess Records in Chicago\, Illinois. Sonny Boy had begun developing a following in Chicago beginning in 1953\, when he appeared there as a member of Elmore James's band. It was during his Chess years that he enjoyed his greatest success and acclaim\, recording about 70 songs for Chess subsidiary Checker Records from 1955 to 1964. Sonny Boy's first LP record was titled Down and Out Blues and was released by Checker Records in 1959.

Vocals\, Bass - Spook Guitar - Kecks Sabopharge Drums - Vic 'Fontaine' Greener  Engineer - Kevin Ridley Producer - Kevin Ridley\, Spook And The Ghouls  Recorded at Impulse Studios\, Wallsend.  ------------------------  "Bela Lugosi's Dead" is a gothic rock song written by the band Bauhaus. The song was the band's first single\, released in August 1979\, and is often considered to be the first gothic rock record released. It did not enter the UK pop charts at that time. The b-side features the song "Boys" and some versions also include an early demo recording of what would be their next single\, "Dark Entries". It was released on CD in 1988 and was compiled on the 1998 album\, Crackle - The Best of Bauhaus. The original sleeve art was taken from a still of the film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.  Recording session  "Bela Lugosi's Dead" was recorded during a six-hour session at Beck Studios in Wellingborough on 26 January 1979. Four more songs were recorded ("Boys"\, "Harry"\, "Dark Entries" and the unreleased "Some Faces") but not used; only "Harry" surfaced in 1982 as a single B-side to "Kick In The Eye".  The song "Boys" was re-recorded at Beck Studios in spring 1979.  Use in film and television  The song was featured in the 1983 Tony Scott cult vampire film The Hunger\, with Bauhaus portraying a band in a nightclub\, playing it during the opening credits and introduction. A 7" promotional record featuring an edited version of the song was released to theaters playing the movie.  It was also played throughout the movie Dead Man's Curve/The Curve\, and featured in the French movie\, Sombre. The song is played in the movie Good Luck Chuck as an introduction for when the Goth girl is on screen and it is on the soundtrack.  The song was used as the intro music for the late 1990s Saturday Night Live skit "Goth Talk"\, which had Chris Kattan and Molly Shannon as two goth students. This song was also in an episode in the fifth season of Smallville\, the vampire/Halloween-themed "Thirst". The song was also in an episode of One Tree Hill.  The song was featured in an episode ("Midnight") of the science fiction/horror series Fringe which revolved around a vampire-esque creature.  Comedian and musician Bill Bailey parodied the song on his DVD Cosmic Jam as part of a medley in which he and his band\, the Stan Ellis Experiment performed Cockney Rock style versions of popular songs - this particular segment of the medley included lyrical changes such as "E ad a girl's name".  The song was played almost in its entirety during the horror film The Collector during a scene in which the older daughter was attempting to have sex with her boyfriend before they were both viciously murdered.  The song was played in the opening scene of the Supernatural television series in season 6\, episode 5\, "Live Free or Twi-Hard". The episode is vampire-themed\, poking particular fun at the Twilight movie series and its romanticism of vampires.  The Illuminoids made a mash-up called Lugosi's Mongoloid Loser with Bela Lugosi's Dead by Bauhaus\, Loser by Beck and Mongolid By Devo.  Ethan Gold also covered it. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

Lyrics: Casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walking down The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below Following the footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors Of silent desperation\, never speakin' to a soul The poisoned air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dyin' 'Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes Of the clickin' of the turnstile and the rattle of his chain  "Oh\," she said\, "Casey it's been so long since I've seen you" "Here\," she said\, "just a kiss to make a body smile" "See\," she said\, "I've put on new stockings just to please you" [ Find more Lyrics at www.mp3lyrics.org/1JxX ] "Lord\," she said\, "Casey can you only stay a while"  Casey leaves the underground and stops inside the Golden Crown For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bones Seein' his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men Who reach for anything they can to keep from goin' home Standing in the corner\, Casey drinks his pint of bitter Never glancin' in the mirror at the people passin' by Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason Is the beer that's in his belly or the tear that's in his eye  "Oh!" she said\, "I suppose you seldom think about me" "Now\," she said\, "now that you've a family of your own" "Still\," she said\, "it's so blessed good to feel your body" "Lord\," she said\, "Casey it's a shame to be alone!"

The record was released in June 1979 on Optional Music with "The Man with the Dogs" as the b-side. The title track was re-recorded for the band's first album\, Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables (1980)\, and the version that appeared on this single\, as well as the single's b-side\, are available on the rarities album Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death (1987).  The lyrics were written by Jello Biafra and John Greenway\, and Biafra composed the music in one of his rare attempts at composing on bass.  This song was featured in the video game Tony Hawk's American Wasteland and as a downloadable song in the Rock Band series. It is also sampled in a song by the dance-punk/big beat trio The Prodigy\, "Dead Ken Beats". The song was also featured in the 2010 film The Social Network.  Meaning  The title is an allusion to the first (and no longer sung) stanza of the national anthem of Germany\, which begins with the words "Deutschland\, Deutschland über alles." (literally\, "Germany\, Germany above all.")  The song focuses on Jerry Brown\, the Governor of California 1975-1983 and 2011--present\, and is sung from his perspective. An imaginary Brown outlines a hippie-fascist vision for America\, in which his "suede denim secret police" kill un-cool people with "organic poison gas" chambers. Lines such as "Serpent's egg already hatched" (a reference to a line from William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar) comment on the corrosive nature of power. The line "now it is 1984" refers to the totalitarian regime of George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four\, describing a future (from 1979) where Jerry Brown has become President Brown presiding over secret police and gas chambers.  Cover versions  Blue Ribbon Glee Club regularly perform their version of the song.  The song was updated by The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy when they released a cover version in 1992 on the album Hypocrisy is the Greatest Legacy. They replaced references to Jerry Brown with references to Pete Wilson.  The song was also widely known in Poland (as "Kalifornia Ponad Wszystko") thanks to the cover by Polish rocker Kazik Staszewski with his band Kazik Na Żywo.  Hasidic New Wave perform a remake of the song on their 1999 album\, Kabalogy. In their version\, titled "Giuliani Über Alles"\, Jerry Brown is replaced by former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani.  The Delgados cover the song in their Peel Sessions CD set.  Six Feet Under do a cover the song on their Graveyard Classics album.  The black metal band Mayhem also covered the song.  Deceased covered the song on their punk covers album Rotten to the Core.  The hardcore band Ceremony has covered the song.  The Who Boys have done a mashup of "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" by Gil Scott-Heron called "Revolution Über Alles".  John Linnell and his band The Statesmen covered it live at least once during his "State Songs" tour\, choosing to perform it because it mentioned the state of California.  Dramarama has recorded a version\, updated in 2003 about California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger... "You will lift weights in school".  A 1986 live recording focused on Ronald Reagan on the album Mutiny On The Bay with live recordings from 1982 and 1986.  Jayne County covered the song with She Wolves about California's Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The green vinyl single was released under artist name Jayne County Meets The She Wolves by the German label Trash 2001.  Mexican death metal band Brujería covers Dead Kennedys with the song "California Uber Aztlan" in 2010. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

COL title VAL Mountain Dew COL performer VAL Lulu Belle and Scotty	COL video title VAL Little Birdie - Vernon Dalhart COL description VAL Recorded on September 19\, 1925 under the pseudonym of Al Craver. Dalhart was born in Jefferson\, Texas. He took his stage name from two towns\, Vernon and Dalhart in Texas\, between which he punched cattle in the 1890s. Dalhart's father\, Robert Marion Slaughter was killed by his brother-in-law\, Bob Castleberry\, when Vernon was age 10. When Vernon was 12 or 13\, the family moved from Jefferson to Dallas\, Texas. Vernon\, who already could play the jaw harp and harmonica\, received vocal training at the Dallas Conservatory of Music. He married Sadie Lee Moore-Livingston in 1901 and had two children\, a son and a daughter. Around 1910 the family moved to New York City. He found employment in a piano warehouse and took occasional singing jobs. One of his first roles was in Giacomo Puccini's opera Girl of the Golden West; following this he played the part of Ralph Rackstraw in a production of HMS Pinafore. He also played the part of Lieutenant Pinkerton in Madame Butterfly.  He saw an advertisement in the local newspaper for singers and applied\, and was auditioned by Thomas Alva Edison; he would thereafter make numerous records for Edison Records. From 1916 until 1923\, using numerous pseudonyms\, he made over 400 recordings of light classical music and early dance band vocals for various record labels. He was already an established singer when he made his first country music recordings which cemented his place in music history. Dalhart's 1924 recording of "The Wreck of the Old 97"—a classic American railroad ballad about the September 27\, 1903 derailment of Southern Railway Fast Mail train No. 97 near Danville\, Virginia—for the Victor Talking Machine Company\, became a runaway hit\, alerting the national record companies to the existence of a sizable market for country-style vocals. It became the first Southern song to become a national success. The double-sided single eventually sold more than seven million copies\, a colossal number for a mid-1920s recording. It was the best-selling single to its time\, and was the biggest-selling non-holiday record in the first 70 years of recorded music. Research by Billboard statistician Joel Whitburn determined "The Prisoner's Song" to have been a No. 1 hit for 12 weeks in 1925-26. In 1998\, "The Prisoner's Song" was honored with a Grammy Hall of Fame Award and the Recording Industry Association of America named it one of the Songs of the Century. It was the desire of the Victor Talking Machine Company to duplicate the sales success of 'Wreck/Prisoner' that led them to contract with Ralph S. Peer to go to the southern mountains in the Summer of 1927 to facilitate 'The Bristol Sessions'\, arguably the single-most important recording event in the history of country music\, where Jimmie Rodgers and the original Carter Family were first discovered\, and after which\, Peer's royalty model would become the standard of the entire recorded music industry. He recorded under a host of pseudonyms given to him by recording managers. On Grey Gull Records he often used the pseudonym Vel Veteran\, which was however also used by other singers\, including Arthur Fields (Fields also used the pseudonym "Mr. X"). It is thought that Dalhart had the most recordings of any person in history. To some\, Dalhart's Southern accent seemed artificial. In a 1918 interview Dalhart said\, "When you are born and brought up in the South your only trouble is to talk any other way...the sure 'nough Southerner talks almost like a Negro\, even when he's white. I've broken myself of the habit\, more or less\, in ordinary conversation\, but it still comes pretty easy." While some country music purists always viewed Dalhart with some suspicion because of his light opera background and a vocal style that was closer to pop than country\, he was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970\, into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1981 and into the Gennett Records Walk of Fame in 2007. Dalhart died in Bridgeport\, Connecticut in 1948 and is interred there in the Mountain Grove Cemetery. COL channel name VAL althazarr's good time oldies	0

COL title VAL I'm Not Like Everybody Else COL performer VAL Television Personalities	COL video title VAL Leslie West - Politician.wmv COL description VAL Leslie West - Got Blooze (2005) Guitar hero Leslie West has issued countless albums over the years\, mostly either as a member of Mountain or as a solo artist. But he has never set out to record an album comprised entirely of classic blues rockers. Then 2005's Got Blooze came along. While this sort of thing has been done by countless fellow veteran classic rock acts of late (the best-known of the bunch being Aerosmith's Honkin' on Bobo)\, it turns out to be custom-made for a player like West. Throughout the 12-track set\, West keeps things raw and gritty\, as evidenced by such standouts as the extraordinary "Third Degree" and a cover of the oft-overlooked Cream gem\, "Politician." West also surrounds himself with a fantastic rhythm section\, comprised of Vanilla Fudge's Tim Bogert on bass and session ace Aynsley Dunbar on drums (turns out the pair pulled double duty\, as they also backed ex-Ozzy Osbourne guitarist Jake E. Lee on an additional album full of covers\, Retraced). While we probably could have done without the umpteenth cover of "Baby Please Don't Go" (AC/DC\, Aerosmith\, Ted Nugent\, and countless others have played it over the years)\, overall\, Got Blooze is a welcome return for West\, and easily his strongest\, most focused work in quite some time.

COL title VAL Lights Out COL performer VAL Bernie Woods and The Forest Fires	COL video title VAL Shakin´ Stevens & The Sunsets - Lights Out (1970) COL description VAL Shakin´ Stevens began his professional performing career during 1968\, fronting Shakin' Stevens and the Sunsets\, created and managed by South Wales rock and roll promoter and impresario Paul 'Legs' Barrett (no relation). The Sunsets were a 1950s-influenced rock'n'roll outfit from Penarth\, South Glamorgan that had evolved from a band\, previously called The Backbeats since 1958\,[3] who invited Stevens to join them after he had been an avid fan of the band for several years and occasionally hopped on stage to do a guest vocal.  An early break for Shaky and the band presented itself when they were given a support slot for The Rolling Stones in December 1969. Despite landing a recording contract with Parlophone Records the following year and releasing a Dave Edmunds produced album\, the optimistically and prematurely titled A Legend\, the band found success hard to come by\, at least in their native Great Britain\, though they had several hit singles in other countries. The band toured Germany and the Netherlands in between regular UK dates as the band's reputation for staging a vibrant and exciting show grew.[ COL channel name VAL ArkivArkiv	1

COL title VAL Mother and Child Reunion COL performer VAL Johnny Rivers	COL video title VAL Randy California / Kapt. Kopter &  The (Fabulous) Twirly Birds - Mother And Child Reunion COL description VAL Randy California (наст. имя Randy Craig Wolfe; Лос-Анджелес\, 20 февраля 1951 - 2 января 1997) был гитарист\, вокалист и автор песен рок-группы Spirit\, созданной в 1967 году. Входит в список "100 лучших гитаристов мира" по версии журнала Classic Rock. Сценический псевдоним "Рэнди Калифорния" дал ему (в 15 лет) Джими Хендрикс\, чтобы можно было отличить от другого Рэнди в тогдашней группе Хендрикса Jimmy James and the Blue Flames (второго Рэнди Хендрикс называл "Рэнди Техас"). После ухода из группы Spirit (июль 1971) Рэнди начал сольную карьеру\, подписал контракт с Epic и выпустил осенью 1972 года альбом Kapt. Kopter and the (Fabulous) Twirly Birds. Музыка - Хендриксо-подобная\, с импровизациями\, кроме того здесь на некоторых треках играет басист Noel Redding (ex-Jimi Hendrix Experience). Следует отметить\, что на этой пластинке некоторые известные музыканты записаны под псевдонимами. С Эдом Кэссиди (своим отчимом) и басистом Ларри Найтом (Larry «Fuzzy» Knight) он провёл в Европе гастроли в поддержку своей пластинки. Но не совсем удачные\, так как Калифорния оказался неважным промоутером... Трио\, кроме того\, подготовило концептуальный альбом Potatoland\, но лейбл его отверг и Калифорния на некоторое время ушёл из музыкального бизнеса\, поселившись на Гавайях.

This one was uploaded originally in Mar 20\, 2011 - 6\,231views)  ------------------------  "Sunday Girl" is a 1978 song written and recorded by the American group Blondie. The track was a no. 1 hit in the UK Singles Chart for three weeks in May 1979\, but despite this was not released as a single in the United States.  Song information  The song was written by Chris Stein and was the fourth single to be taken from the album\, Parallel Lines\, in the UK and most other parts of the world. The single had an unusual release in Australia\, with some dispute among fans as to whether it reached no. 1 there or failed to chart. This is because of its initial release as the lead single from Parallel Lines\, due to its being reminiscent of "In The Flesh"\, Blondie's first hit in Australia. "Sunday Girl" failed to chart\, however\, and was later re-released as a double A-side with "Heart of Glass"\, on the back of its UK success. As a result\, it was eclipsed by the disco track\, and is rarely recognised as having charted in its own right.  A French-language version of the track was released in the UK on the "Sunday Girl" 12" single; in France and the Netherlands\, it was the B-side of the 7". It also appears on the cassette release of Eat to the Beat. For Blondie's first greatest hits album The Best of Blondie in 1981\, producer Mike Chapman created a special mix which incorporated one verse sung in French. The bilingual version appears on the 2002 compilation Greatest Hits.  In 2010 a remake of this song was made by the English performer Florrie. It had slightly different lyrics and was used for a Nina Ricci perfume commercial. The song was covered in 2013 by the band She & Him on the album Volume 3.  In 2013 Blondie themselves re-recorded the song and offered it to be included in the CBGB's film soundtrack. This version was included on their 2014 compilation album Greatest Hits Deluxe Redux. The compilation was part of a 2-disc set called Blondie 4(0) Ever which included their 10th studio album Ghosts of Download and marked the 40th anniversary of the forming of the band.

Migliacci  Traducida por "Kara Hidden"  C'era un ragazzo che come me amava i Beatles e i Rolling Stones\, girava il mondo veniva da gli Stati Uniti d'America.  Non era bello\, ma accanto a sè aveva mille donne se cantava Help\, Ticket to Ride\, o Lady Jane\, o Yesterday\, cantava: Viva la Libertà\, ma ricevette una lettera. La sua chitarra mi regalò\, fu richiamato in America.  Stop! Coi Rolling Stones! Stop! Coi Beatles stop! M'han detto "va nel Viet-nam e spara ai Viet-cong" tatatatatatatatata...  C'era un ragazzo che come me amava i Beatles e i Rolling Stones\, girava il mondo e poi finì a far la guerra nel Viet-Nam.  Capelli lunghi non porta giù\, non suona la chitarra ma uno strumento che sempre dà la stessa nota "ta-ra-ta-ta". Non ha più amici\, non ha più fans\, vede la gente cadere giù\, nel suo paese non tornerà\, adesso è morto nel Viet-Nam.  Stop! Coi Rolling Stones! Stop! Coi Beatles\, stop!

COL title VAL Mr. Blue Sky COL performer VAL OnCue	COL video title VAL Eddy Arnold -- Seven Years With The Wrong Woman (VintageMusic.es) COL description VAL Eddy Arnold\, nacido el 15 de mayo de 1918 en la localidad de Henderson\, condado de Chester\, Tennessee y fallecido el 8 de mayo de 2008 en Franklin\, condado de Williamson\, Tennessee debido a una enfermedad\, fue un músico estadounidense\, especialmente volcado a la música country\, cuyo verdadero nombre era Richard Edward Arnold. Entre su debut en el mundo de la música en 1945 y 1954\, Eddie logró 58 top ten consecutivos\, y nunca marcó menos de un top 40 durante sus 21 años de carrera\, con más de 140 discos diferentes de los cuales se vendieron más de 85 millones de copias\, incluidos eternos clásicos como Bouquet de Rosas o Anytime. Recibió el apodo de Tennessee Plowboy (el chico del arado de Tennessee en inglés)\, y firmó contratos con las compañías discográficas RCA Records y MGM Records.  Richard Edward Arnold nació en Henderson\, en el condado de Chester\, estado de Tennessee\, el 15 de mayo de 1918 y se educó en el medio rural. Su padre era un violinista que alentó a su hijo respecto del desarrollo de sus talentos musicales y logró reunir el dinero suficiente para comprar a su niño una guitarra a la edad de 10 años. Para cuando entró en la escuela secundaria Eddie Arnols ya era toda una estrella local\, pero con la llegada de la Gran Depresión en 1929 y la crisis económica de los años 1930\, Eddy tuvo que dejar la escuela para ayudar trabajar como asistente en una funeraria. Relegó sus actuaciones musicales a funciones locales\, aunque de vez en cuando viajaba montado en una mula con su guitarra a la espalda.  Al igual que otros artistas del country de la época\, Eddy consiguió su pase al estrellato con sus apariciones en vivo por la radio\, antes de debutar en Jackson\, en Tennessee\, en 1936 y posteriormente en San Luis\, en el estado de Misuri.  Entre 1940 y 1943 apareció en el Grand Ole Opry junto a Pee Wee King. Apodado como el chico del arado de Tennessee (o Tennessee Plowboy\, en inglés) firmó con la RCA Victor Records un contrato en 1944 con ese nombre\, que fue el que apareció en sus discos hasta 1954. Con el tema Every hour Seems A Million Years alcanzó el quinto disco de su carrera\, dando con dicho disco comienzo a la cadena de 58 consecutivos éxitos top ten. En 1947 Arnold logró sus tres primeros éxitos número uno\, siendo uno de ellos número uno durante 21 semanas. Eddy Arnold realizó temas universalmente populares convirtiéndose en una estrella perenne\, grabando discos durante un período de cinco décadas\, desde los años 1960 hasta los años 1980; tras una pausa de siete años incluso regresó al estudio en 1990.  Además de establecer un nivel inigualable dada su avanzada edad\, Arnold se convirtió en un ejemplo de cómo manejar su fortuna en el mundo del espectáculo. "Guardo mi primer dólar y sigo ahorrando e invirtiendo mi dinero"\, recuerda\, "nunca olvidé cómo se sentía ser pobre"\, añadió. Eddie Anold se convirtió en uno de los hombres más ricos de la industria mediante la inversión en la única cosa que él consideraba de valor de propiedad\, "la tierra". Debido a su enorme popularidad musical Eddy Arnold se convirtió en un auténtico embajador de la música country a nivel mundial   Spotify:http://open.spotify.com/album/4tQOsxLgCwxPCRNS5LeWxN iTunes:http://itunes.apple.com/es/album/vintage-country-no-11-ep-all/id374306958 Síguenos en: Spotify: https://goo.gl/raouHQ Facebook: https://goo.gl/L92BHL Instagram: https://goo.gl/3oYDGH Web: http://www.vintagemusic.es   Compra nuestros Cd's en formato físico en estas plataformas: Ebay:  http://stores.ebay.com/VintageMusicFm BoutiqAlia: www.boutiqalia-vintagemusic.com Discogs: https://www.discogs.com/es/seller/vintagemusicfm/profile COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm	0

COL title VAL I'm So Glad COL performer VAL The Scot Richard Case	COL video title VAL Leslie West - Politician.wmv COL description VAL Leslie West - Got Blooze (2005) Guitar hero Leslie West has issued countless albums over the years\, mostly either as a member of Mountain or as a solo artist. But he has never set out to record an album comprised entirely of classic blues rockers. Then 2005's Got Blooze came along. While this sort of thing has been done by countless fellow veteran classic rock acts of late (the best-known of the bunch being Aerosmith's Honkin' on Bobo)\, it turns out to be custom-made for a player like West. Throughout the 12-track set\, West keeps things raw and gritty\, as evidenced by such standouts as the extraordinary "Third Degree" and a cover of the oft-overlooked Cream gem\, "Politician." West also surrounds himself with a fantastic rhythm section\, comprised of Vanilla Fudge's Tim Bogert on bass and session ace Aynsley Dunbar on drums (turns out the pair pulled double duty\, as they also backed ex-Ozzy Osbourne guitarist Jake E. Lee on an additional album full of covers\, Retraced). While we probably could have done without the umpteenth cover of "Baby Please Don't Go" (AC/DC\, Aerosmith\, Ted Nugent\, and countless others have played it over the years)\, overall\, Got Blooze is a welcome return for West\, and easily his strongest\, most focused work in quite some time.

COL title VAL It Hurts to Be in Love COL performer VAL Gene Pitney	COL video title VAL Affirmation - Jose Feliciano Original 1975 (also by Nujabes Counting Stars cover by George Benson) COL description VAL https://www.facebook.com/Jose-Feliciano-Fan-Area-1387556718159682  Affirmation Instrumental by Jose Feliciano recorded in his 1975 RCA album "Just Wann Rock'n'Roll"  FINALLY in CD !!!  in a new FANTASTIC COMPILATION for Jose Feliciano called "NO JIVE"...  (don't confuse  with many other compilations\, they has another 1996 re-recorded version)  NO JIVE is ABSOLUTELY THE BEST COMPILATION ABOUT JOSE FELICIANO 2 CD with his hit and many rarities never released before and many intrumentals  The song is also famous in the cover by George Benson in his hit album "Breezin" from 1976 and recently sampled by DJ Nujabes in Counting Stars part of the Samurai Champloo line up as "Shino's Theme" Video isn't of the.... Vinyl Version!!  here the story "How George Benson covered Affirmation by Jose Feliciano" by his producer LiPuma  A review by '70s for Breezin LP  Though Side One of Breezin' had the hits\, Side Two was a creamy\, seamless masterpiece unto itself. It unfolded with "Affirmation\," a song composed by Jose Feliciano\, the international superstar singer/guitarist/composer who had recorded it on his album\, Just Wanna Rock 'N' Roll (RCA)\, from the fall of '75. "Affirmation" was the sole instrumental on that Feliciano LP\, providing the blind Puerto Rican wunderkind a golden opportunity to showcase his skills on acoustic Spanish guitar\, electric rhythm guitar (with a wah-wah effect)\, electric bass\, congas and as a string arranger! LiPuma was enchanted with the melody of Feliciano's relatively brief (3:33) recording. When material was being prepared for Breezin'\, he presented it to Benson\, who liked it immediately. The band worked up an arrangement that loosened and elongated the vibe of the original. Like Feliciano's version\, George begins "Affirmation" alone\, caressing an introduction of choice notes and a smooth rendering of its signature run down the frets. But when the rhythm section eases in\, led by MacDonald's congas\, the groove is more relaxed and funky in a way that is quite different from Feliciano's more insistent arrangement\, which throbbed with forthright Latin pride. Where Feliciano had his rhythm section drop out for the soaring bridge\, Benson's band rides it like the wind\, drummer Mason liberating the rhythm by opening up on his cymbals. Benson tickles the strings with a tasty solo that leads into the killer breakdown section\, with Upchurch dipping into his effects bag. And then\, in what has to be one of the all-time classiest hand-offs in music\, Benson makes way for Dalto's wistful electric piano (complete with soulful little comps) before Benson takes it home\, getting in a few final signature licks. Benson's "Affirmation" is seven minutes of masterful musical heaven. http://www.fantasticfeliciano.too.it/ COL channel name VAL Thevolumex	0

It was released on the band's fifth full-length studio album\, Document\, and also as a 7" vinyl single in 1987. The song was their first hit single\, reaching #9 in the US Billboard Hot 100\, #14 in Canada\, and later reached #16 in the UK singles chart on its UK release (1991).  The song was included in Activision's Guitar Hero World Tour and is in Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades.  The accompanying video's director was artist Robert Longo.  The director of photography was Alton Brown\, who later became a Food Network chef.  In March 2005\, Q magazine placed "The One I Love" at number 57 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks.  The song is included on R.E.M. Live.  Lyrics and meaning  Many listeners who misunderstand the song's meaning have made the song a popular radio dedication to loved ones\, relying on the main lyric\, "This one goes out to the one I love."  However\, they missed an ensuing line: "A simple prop to occupy my time"; the song was not particularly a love song.  Stipe related in 1987 to Rolling Stone\, "I've always left myself pretty open to interpretation. It's probably better that they just think it's a love song at this point."  However\, in an interview in the January 1988 issue of Musician magazine he said that the song was "incredibly violent" and "It's very clear that it's about using people over and over again".  The song contains only three verses\, which are all near identical\, with small variations each repeat of the verse. (For example "A simple prop to occupy my time"\, "Another prop has occupied my time"). The chorus consists of just the word "fire"\, repeated (with the backing vocal of "She's coming down on her own now/Coming down on her own"\, sung by Mike Mills).  Cover versions  Bush Sufjan Stevens Massacre and many more. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

COL title VAL Say Say Say COL performer VAL Zolof the Rock & Roll Destroyer	COL video title VAL Randy California / Kapt. Kopter &  The (Fabulous) Twirly Birds - Mother And Child Reunion COL description VAL Randy California (наст. имя Randy Craig Wolfe; Лос-Анджелес\, 20 февраля 1951 - 2 января 1997) был гитарист\, вокалист и автор песен рок-группы Spirit\, созданной в 1967 году. Входит в список "100 лучших гитаристов мира" по версии журнала Classic Rock. Сценический псевдоним "Рэнди Калифорния" дал ему (в 15 лет) Джими Хендрикс\, чтобы можно было отличить от другого Рэнди в тогдашней группе Хендрикса Jimmy James and the Blue Flames (второго Рэнди Хендрикс называл "Рэнди Техас"). После ухода из группы Spirit (июль 1971) Рэнди начал сольную карьеру\, подписал контракт с Epic и выпустил осенью 1972 года альбом Kapt. Kopter and the (Fabulous) Twirly Birds. Музыка - Хендриксо-подобная\, с импровизациями\, кроме того здесь на некоторых треках играет басист Noel Redding (ex-Jimi Hendrix Experience). Следует отметить\, что на этой пластинке некоторые известные музыканты записаны под псевдонимами. С Эдом Кэссиди (своим отчимом) и басистом Ларри Найтом (Larry «Fuzzy» Knight) он провёл в Европе гастроли в поддержку своей пластинки. Но не совсем удачные\, так как Калифорния оказался неважным промоутером... Трио\, кроме того\, подготовило концептуальный альбом Potatoland\, но лейбл его отверг и Калифорния на некоторое время ушёл из музыкального бизнеса\, поселившись на Гавайях.

Talk about a lead singer being camera shy - you only saw his face maybe 5 or 6 times during the performance. Most of the time his back was to the audience.

Please don't tell me how the story ends (1970)  This could be our last good night together We may never pass this way again. Just let me enjoy it 'til it's over\, or forever  Please don't tell me how the story ends.  See the way our shadows come together Softer than your fingers on my skin Someday these may be all we remember of each other Please don't tell me how the story ends.

Still got scars on my back from your knife So don't think it's in the past\, these kinda wounds they last and they last. Now did you think it all through? All these things will catch up to you And time can heal but this won't\, so if you're coming my way\, just don't  Oh\, it's so sad to think about the good times\, you and I  'Cause\, baby\, now we got bad blood You know it used to be mad love So take a look what you've done 'Cause\, baby\, now we got bad blood Hey Now we got problems And I don't think we can solve them You made a really deep cut And\, baby\, now we got bad blood Hey  Band-aids don't fix bullet holes You say sorry just for show If you live like that\, you live with ghosts (ghosts) Band-aids don't fix bullet holes (hey) You say sorry just for show (hey) If you live like that\, you live with ghosts (hey) If you love like that blood runs cold  'Cause\, baby\, now we got bad blood You know it used to be mad love (mad love) So take a look what you've done 'Cause\, baby\, now we got bad blood Hey Now we got problems And I don't think we can solve them (think we can solve them) You made a really deep cut And\, baby\, now we got bad blood (Hey) COL channel name VAL Brooklyn Duo	0

Henry Thomas was more a Songster than a Blues musician who played his own reworks of traditionals and standards alike with the unique touch of the Quills which he plays along with the Guitar in a style which appears to be completely individual for Thomas as a Musician.  Lyrics from Weeniepedia  Bull Doze Blues - Henry Thomas  I'm going away\, babe\, and it won't be long I'm going away and it won't be long I'm going away and it won't be long  Just as sure as that train leaves out of that Mobile yard Just as sure as that train leaves out of that Mobile yard Just as sure as that train leaves out of that Mobile yard  Come shake your hand\, tell your papa goodbye Come shake your hand\, tell your papa goodbye Come shake your hand\, tell your papa goodbye  I'm going back to Tennessee I'm going back to Memphis\, Tennessee I'm going back\, Memphis\, Tennessee  I'm going where I never get bulldozed I'm going where I never get the bulldoze I'm going where I never get bulldozed  If you don't believe I'm sinking\, look what a hole I'm in If you don't believe I'm sinking\, look what a hole I'm in If you don't believe I'm sinking\, look what a fool I've been.  Oh\, my babe\, take me back. How in the world\, Lord\, take me back. COL channel name VAL PreWarMusic	1

COL title VAL Sabbath Bloody Sabbath COL performer VAL Amon Amarth	COL video title VAL The Charlie Daniels Band - Pride And Joy.wmv COL description VAL Tailgate Party This CD contains some of the greatest rock songs of all time. Originally made legendary by some of the south's best rock bands\, Charlie adds his own unique sound to each song. Originals\, live and studio versions make this collection live up to its' name by being a great one to pull out during a "Tailgate Party."   Description      13 Tracks previously released in 1999     Engineered\, Produced and Mixed by: Ron W. Griffin     Executive Producer: David Corlew  Guide Review - Charlie Daniels Band - Tailgate Party  Included on this very southern rock flavored collection are live versions of "The Legend of Wooley Swamp" and "The Devil Went Down to Georgia." With both songs being so well known and played a gazillion times\, it was refreshing to hear them live and just slightly different from what we are normally accustomed to.  "The South's Gonna Do It Again" had an added bonus to it by having a very early on in his career performance by Keith Urban\, showing us some very impressive guitar solo's. Remakes of ZZ Top's "Sharp Dressed Man" and Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Freebird" were very captivating and showed off some incredible fiddle playing by Charlie. Probably one of my most favorites was CDB's remake of the song made famous by Hootie and the Blowfish\, "Let Her Cry." Charlie has always been well known for his playing but under rated for his vocals. This song shows off just how well he can deliver some very heartfelt emotions and I really enjoyed listening to this new version.  If you have ever appreciated CDB\, you will really like this release. If for nothing else\, the diversity of the genre's and CDB being able to add the country sound without destroying the memory of the song.  Track Listing  1 The South's Gonna Do It  3:57 2 Pride and Joy  4:03 3 Can't You See  6:26 4 Let Her Cry  4:00 5 Homesick  3:53 6 Keep Your Hands to Yourself  3:12 7 Statesboro Blues  4:22 8 Peach County Jamboree  3:18 9 Sharp Dressed Man  4:46 10 Free Bird  6:38 11 The Legend of Wooley Swamp [Live]  5:21 12 El Toreador [Live]  5:26 13 The Devil Went Down to Georgia [Live]  3:44 COL channel name VAL SOUTHERN REBEL	0

COL title VAL One COL performer VAL Periphery	COL video title VAL Bull Doze Blues COL description VAL One of Henry Thomas' most renowned recording which was covered to great acclaim in the 1960's by Blues Rock band Canned Heat. Henry Thomas was more a Songster than a Blues musician who played his own reworks of traditionals and standards alike with the unique touch of the Quills which he plays along with the Guitar in a style which appears to be completely individual for Thomas as a Musician.  Lyrics from Weeniepedia  Bull Doze Blues - Henry Thomas  I'm going away\, babe\, and it won't be long I'm going away and it won't be long I'm going away and it won't be long  Just as sure as that train leaves out of that Mobile yard Just as sure as that train leaves out of that Mobile yard Just as sure as that train leaves out of that Mobile yard  Come shake your hand\, tell your papa goodbye Come shake your hand\, tell your papa goodbye Come shake your hand\, tell your papa goodbye  I'm going back to Tennessee I'm going back to Memphis\, Tennessee I'm going back\, Memphis\, Tennessee  I'm going where I never get bulldozed I'm going where I never get the bulldoze I'm going where I never get bulldozed  If you don't believe I'm sinking\, look what a hole I'm in If you don't believe I'm sinking\, look what a hole I'm in If you don't believe I'm sinking\, look what a fool I've been.

Hey\, you can't win 'em all -- let's just be friends WITHOUT you playing my goddamn music.   Hear "Mornings Considered" review of Jim Terr CD: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djdE5JLPdu8  See old JT performance used in this piece: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=povgDnXH94w  Music reviews etc. at http://ninegifts.com/  Movie info referenced is at http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0855719/  Snapple and other jingle info at http://bluecanyonproductions.com/jingular/index.htm  Not directly related\, but great fun\, is "World's Most Obnoxious Interviewer": http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2oj5mv0j8  More info on Jim's friend BuDDy at end of this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOFKLfyxgPo   **NEVER ON NPR** Jim Terr © 2009-2012  They've played my stuff on tons of podcasts and broadcasts\, in movies with Rebecca DeMornay. Been used in jingles by the sack full\, for Snapple\, and tonsils\, and folks who've passed away.  Yeah you can hear me on the iPods\, in hot rods\, in old Saabs or any kind of car. But never on All Things Considered\, or  Morning Edition\, no not on NPR.  I get royalties\, from Israel and Iran\, India and Spain\, France and Uzbekistan. I still hope some day\, to become a star\, But it sure won't be\, thanks to NPR.  I've been compared to Tom T. Hall\, Jackie Mason\, Jimmy Rodgers\, Shel Silverstein and Mark Twain. But if you listened just to NPR\, like I do\, you'd prob'ly never hear my name again. Hundreds of thousands of plays of videos\, on radio\, country & rock\, Google me sometime\, son. But I'm not literary or exotic\, neurotic\, a film star or descended from one..  I'm not paranoid\, enough to think they fear it\, But as far as my stuff\, they just won't go near it. Not trying to burn bridges\, but I'll go so far\, As to say you'll hear me\, never on NPR.  Yes I've been compared to Loudon Wainwright\, yes that's right\, Townes VannZandt\, Phil Ochs & Bobby Bare. Not only that / to Paul Craft\, Ray Stevens / yes even to the man himself\,Tom Leher. And my friend BuDDy has been hallowed by James Fallows and Dave Barry\, but never by Steve Inskeep. Firesign's Phil Proctor\, Hodding Carter\, but from NPR you'll never hear a peep. COL channel name VAL jaimejaime	0

COL title VAL Panic COL performer VAL Janice Whaley	COL video title VAL The Easy Riders -- South Coast COL description VAL The Easy Riders were an American folk music band\, that operated from 1956 to 1959\, consisting of Terry Gilkyson\, Richard Dehr\, and Frank Miller. Their career was guided by Mitch Miller\, who had them under contract for Columbia Records. Their greatest hit\, in early 1957\, was the song "Marianne". The group also composed some tunes for the 1958 cinemiracle-documentaryWindjammer\, such as "Kari Waits for Me" and "Sugar Cane". One of Gilkyson's songs was a number one hit for Frankie Laine\, "The Cry of the Wild Goose". Gilkyson wrote many tunes for Laine\, and he and The Easy Riders were also featured on Frankie's 1957 hit\, "Love Is a Golden Ring"\, having also penned the number for Laine.  Many songs of the group became better known through the interpretation of other singers\, such as the Kingston Trio\, Gale Storm\, Harry Belafonte\, Doris Day\, Burl Ives and the The Brothers Four. Their song "Memories Are Made of This" became a top hit through the interpretation by Dean Martin. After the Easy Riders made a single with the 1927 song "Tell The Captain"\, the Beach Boys adapted it and made of it their hit "Sloop John B". Gilkyson left the group in the early 1960s to work for Disney studios and wrote the Oscar-nominated "The Bear Necessities" for Disney's The Jungle Book.

Joey DeFrancesco Composed: Sam Jones Cd: "Like That"\, Recording Date: August 30\, 1995 - August 31\, 1995  Release Date: April 30\, 1996   Subscribe Here: http://www.youtube.com/user/TheSouLighting http://www.facebook.com/thesoulighting  Jimmy Bruno\, born July 22\, 1953 in Philadelphia\, Pennsylvania\, is a master jazz guitarist and jazz educator. He started playing at the age of 7. He began his professional career at the age of 19\, touring with Buddy Rich. Among his many credits\, he is the only guitarist to have ever led Frank Sinatra's band. He played for many years in Los Angeles before returning to the Philadelphia area. He counts Johnny Smith\, Hank Garland\, Joe Pass\, Tal Farlow\, Wes Montgomery\, Howard Roberts\, Jim Hall\, and Pat Martino amongst his influences. In March\, 2011 Jimmy opened up Jimmy Bruno's Guitar Workshop\, a website that allows students to learn directly from Jimmy through video lessons.  For more information: http://jimmybruno.com/biography.php  Although Like That was recorded in New York\, many of the people involved with the project were Philadelphians. The pleasing hard bop date unites Jimmy Bruno's Philly-based trio of the 1990s (which includes bassist Craig Thomas and drummer Steve Holloway) with organist/trumpeter and Philly native Joey DeFrancesco\, Although DeFrancesco plays organ on most of the 11 songs\, he switches to the trumpet and favors a Miles Davis-influenced mute on relaxed versions of "There Is No Greater Love" and "Stars Fell on Alabama."   Ο Jimmy Bruno γεννήθηκε στις 22 Ιουλίου 1953\, στην Πενσυλβάνια και είναι ένας Αμερικανός master κιθαρίστας και διδάσκαλος της τζαζ. Παίζει από ηλικία 7 ετών και ξεκίνησε την επαγγελματική του καριέρα στην ηλικία των 19\, περιοδεύοντας με τον Buddy Rich. Μεταξύ των πολλών του διακρίσεων\, είναι ότι ήταν ο μόνος επικεφαλής κιθαρίστας της μπάντας του Frank Sinatra. Έπαιξε για πολλά χρόνια στο Λος Άντζελες πριν από την επιστροφή στην  Φιλαδέλφεια. Έχει επηρεαστεί\, μεταξύ άλλων\, από τους  Johnny Smith\, Hank Garland\, Joe Pass\, Tal Farlow\, Wes Montgomery\, Howard Roberts\, Jim Hall\, and Pat Martino. Από τον Μάρτιο του 2011\, άνοιξε την ιστοσελίδα: Jimmy Bruno's Guitar Workshop\,  που επιτρέπει στους μαθητές του να εξασκηθούν απευθείας από τον Bruno μέσω βίντεο μαθημάτων. Περισσότερες πληροφορίες: http://jimmybruno.com/biography.php  Το μουσικό κομμάτι “Unit Seven” είναι το από το cd του 1996 με τίτλο “Like That”\, που ηχογραφήθηκε στη Νέα Υόρκη και οι περισσότεροι μουσικοί ήταν από την Φιλαδέλφεια. Στο βασικό του τρίο (με μπάσσο τον Craig Thomas και ντράμμερ τον Steve Holloway) της περιόδου του 1990\, προστέθηκε ο  οργανίστας/τρομπετίστας Joey DeFrancesco (επίσης από την Φιλαδέλφεια).  Ο Joey DeFrancesco παίζει όργανο στα περισσότερα από τα 11 κομμάτια\, αλλά και τρομπέτα βαθειά επηρεασμένος από τον τρόπο του Miles Davis (κυρίως στα "There Is No Greater Love" και "Stars Fell on Alabama.")

COL title VAL Zarah (Ich weiß\, es wird einmal ein Wunder geschehen) COL performer VAL Nina Hagen	COL video title VAL Elly Lapp - Ich weiß es wird einmal ein Wunder gescheh'n COL description VAL Elly Lapp Ganz nah  Genre: Deutsch-Pop\, Chanson\, Schlager   „Eine Stimme die unter die Haut geht.  Eindringlich\, lasziv\, ganz nah."   Elly Lapp liebt die Brückenschläge. Für sie sind UFA-Schlager und Popmusik keine  unarrangierbaren Gegensätze\, sondern interpretatorische Herausforderung. Dabei ist eine sehr moderne CD entstanden\,  die gleichzeitig sehr intensiv und sehr persönlich ist. Viel näher geht`s nicht.   Es waren große Songs -- es sind große Songs. Dazu leistet eine interessante Interpretin ihren Beitrag. Elly Lapp. Die studierte Schauspielerin und Sängerin tourt mit eigenen Programmen durch Deutschland -- und sie war die Stimme des Titelsongs der erfolgreichen ARD-Fernsehserie „Kir Royal".  „Der Wind hat mir ein Lied erzählt" - gleichzeitig erste Single - und „Ich steh` im Regen" sind Versuche einer ungewöhnlichen Verbindung von UFA - HIT und POPSOUND. Zarah Leander machte einst diese Songs zu Welterfolgen. Damals hatten die Autoren wohl nie eine Umsetzung mit rockigen Gitarren oder Saxophon im Auge. Hier geben die modernen Instrumente\, wie das gesamte Pop- Arrangement\, eine ganz neue Farbe -- voller Intensität.  Doch die CD von Elly Lapp zeigt die großen Filmhits nicht nur im Popgewand\, sondern auch sehr sparsam\, kunstvoll arrangiert\, als Chansons mit großer interpretatorischer Tiefe.  z.B." Wenn ich mir was wünschen dürfte" und - vor allem - „Der Nowack lässt mich nicht verkommen" -\, ein wahrer Kultsong\, 1959 geschrieben\, sofort auf Schallplatte aufgenommen\, kurzerhand von einem Münchner Gericht verboten und wieder eingestampft -- eine echte Rarität für jedes Rundfunk- und Privatarchiv!

It was also used as the B-side of their 1967 single "All You Need Is Love". New mixes of the song were made available on the compilation albums Magical Mystery Tour and Yellow Submarine Songtrack.  Composition  Two song fragments were combined to create "Baby\, You're a Rich Man". The verses from "One of the Beautiful People" by John Lennon were combined with Paul McCartney's previously unaccompanied "Baby\, you're a rich man ..." chorus. Two songs were combined in a similar fashion to make "A Day in the Life"\, and "I've Got a Feeling".  Recording  The song was recorded and mixed (in mono) on 11 May 1967 at Olympic Sound Studios. The music featured an unusual oboe-like sound which was created with a clavioline (an early forerunner of the synthesiser) and a spin-echo (feed back delay) effect which was used to fill from the end of one line of the verse to the start of the next.  Personnel  Per Lewisohn & MacDonald:  John Lennon -- double-tracked vocal\, clavioline\, piano Paul McCartney -- harmony vocal\, piano\, bass George Harrison -- harmony vocal\, guitar\, handclaps Ringo Starr -- drums\, tambourine\, maracas\, handclaps Brian Jones -- oboe Eddie Kramer -- vibraphone George Martin -- producer Keith Grant -- engineer  Mick Jagger was also present and his name appears on a session tape box\, possibly indicating that he provided backing vocals near the end of the song.

Marilyn Manson frequently introduces his song "The Beautiful People" with the lyric "How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people?"  The Rutles performed the fictional song "Abie You're a Rich Man".  A Disney remake of the Yellow Submarine film\, slated for release in 2012\, will include "Baby\, You're a Rich Man".  ------------------------  Lyrics  How does it feel to be One of the beautiful people? Now that you know who you are What do you want to be? And have you travelled very far? Far as the eye can see. How does it feel to be One of the beautiful people? How often have you been there? Often enough to know. What did you see\, when you were there? Nothing that doesn't show. Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man too. You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo. What a thing to do. Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man too. How does it feel to be One of the beautiful people? Tuned to a natural E Happy to be that way. Now that you've found another key What are you going to play? Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man too. You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo. What a thing to do. Baby you're a rich man...

The edition of TotP this clip hails from is currently missing from the BBC archives. The clip only survives because it was featured on Australian ABC show GTK (Get To Know) in 1974. The GTK programme was retained in the ABC archives as a B&W 16mm kinescope\, hence the less-than-perfect quality. It has subsequently been aired on music show Rage. A copy has now been returned to the BBC.  The clip has been restored and the soundtrack replaced with the record version for audio clarity (Cassidy was miming in the clip anyway).

The record was released in June 1979 on Optional Music with "The Man with the Dogs" as the b-side. The title track was re-recorded for the band's first album\, Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables (1980)\, and the version that appeared on this single\, as well as the single's b-side\, are available on the rarities album Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death (1987).  The lyrics were written by Jello Biafra and John Greenway\, and Biafra composed the music in one of his rare attempts at composing on bass.  This song was featured in the video game Tony Hawk's American Wasteland and as a downloadable song in the Rock Band series. It is also sampled in a song by the dance-punk/big beat trio The Prodigy\, "Dead Ken Beats". The song was also featured in the 2010 film The Social Network.  Meaning  The title is an allusion to the first (and no longer sung) stanza of the national anthem of Germany\, which begins with the words "Deutschland\, Deutschland über alles." (literally\, "Germany\, Germany above all.")  The song focuses on Jerry Brown\, the Governor of California 1975-1983 and 2011--present\, and is sung from his perspective. An imaginary Brown outlines a hippie-fascist vision for America\, in which his "suede denim secret police" kill un-cool people with "organic poison gas" chambers. Lines such as "Serpent's egg already hatched" (a reference to a line from William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar) comment on the corrosive nature of power. The line "now it is 1984" refers to the totalitarian regime of George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four\, describing a future (from 1979) where Jerry Brown has become President Brown presiding over secret police and gas chambers.  Cover versions  Blue Ribbon Glee Club regularly perform their version of the song.  The song was updated by The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy when they released a cover version in 1992 on the album Hypocrisy is the Greatest Legacy. They replaced references to Jerry Brown with references to Pete Wilson.  The song was also widely known in Poland (as "Kalifornia Ponad Wszystko") thanks to the cover by Polish rocker Kazik Staszewski with his band Kazik Na Żywo.  Hasidic New Wave perform a remake of the song on their 1999 album\, Kabalogy. In their version\, titled "Giuliani Über Alles"\, Jerry Brown is replaced by former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani.  The Delgados cover the song in their Peel Sessions CD set.  Six Feet Under do a cover the song on their Graveyard Classics album.  The black metal band Mayhem also covered the song.  Deceased covered the song on their punk covers album Rotten to the Core.  The hardcore band Ceremony has covered the song.  The Who Boys have done a mashup of "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" by Gil Scott-Heron called "Revolution Über Alles".  John Linnell and his band The Statesmen covered it live at least once during his "State Songs" tour\, choosing to perform it because it mentioned the state of California.  Dramarama has recorded a version\, updated in 2003 about California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger... "You will lift weights in school".  A 1986 live recording focused on Ronald Reagan on the album Mutiny On The Bay with live recordings from 1982 and 1986.  Jayne County covered the song with She Wolves about California's Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The green vinyl single was released under artist name Jayne County Meets The She Wolves by the German label Trash 2001.  Mexican death metal band Brujería covers Dead Kennedys with the song "California Uber Aztlan" in 2010. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

They are best known for their million-selling 1971 single "Put Your Hand in the Hand"\, penned by Gene MacLellan.[1] The gramophone record sold over one million copies and received a gold disc awarded by the Recording Industry Association of America on 3 May 1971.[1] Ocean consisted of Greg Brown (vocals\, keyboard)\, Jeff Jones (bass\, vocals)\, Janice Morgan (guitar\, vocals)\, Dave Tamblyn (guitar)\, and Chuck Slater (drums). The album was recorded in Toronto in 1970 and originally released on the highly collectable Yorkville label in Canada. The album contained eight songs written by such notables as Robbie Robertson and Gene MacLellan. The album was picked up in the U.S. by the Kama Sutra label that also released the band's second album in both the U.S. and Canada. Ocean managed another hit in Canada with the song "I've Got a Dream" written by the British songwriting team of Cook and Greenway\, but they failed to make any impact in the U.S. and disbanded in 1975 after only two albums.

Joanie\, who scored a #7 US hit with “Johnny Get Angry” in the summer of 1962\, didn’t return to Hot-100 after “When The Boys Get Together” charted in October of the same year.  Some great records followed on Warners\, however\, including the northern soul favorite\, “Don’t Pity Me” in 1965. By 1967\, Joanie was with Columbia and following year with Capitol but still the hits continued to elude her – notwithstanding the quality of her recordings.  “Step Inside Love” had been a #8 UK hit for Cilla Black during Cilla’s ten year chart run from the early 60s.  The Happy Tiger label was owned by the Flying Tiger Line\, an air freight company. The label ran from 1968-71 and was home to artists such as Donnie Brooks\, Priscilla Paris and Them.

Thus Bessie Jones's dramatic dialogue between Death and the reluctant sinner might just as well have its roots in an African tradition as in the popular religious poems and dramas of medieval Europe in which death was so frequently personified. Chorus O Death in the mornin'\, (3 times) Spare me over another year. Well\, Death walked up into the sinner's gaze\, Says\, "B'lieve you have waited now a little too late\, Your fever now is one hundred and two\, Have a narrow chance if you ever pull through." (Chorus) He cried\, "O Death\," Cryin'\, "O Death in the mornin'\, O Death\, Death\, spare me over in another year. Hey\, what is this I see\, Cold\, icy hands all over me? You say\, "I am Death\, no one can excel\, I span the doors of Death and Hell." (Chorus) 11 "No\, you heard God's people sing and pray\, You would not heed\, you just walked away\, You would not even bend your knee\, Now you got to come and go with me. (Chorus) "Well\, I'm gon' fix your feet so you cannot walk\, 'M fix your tongue where you cannot talk\, Close your eyes and you cannot see\, And you got to come and go with me." (Chorus) "Well\, Death\, consider my age\, And do not take me in this stage\, Because all of my wealth is at your command\, If you'll just move your cold\, icy hand." (Chorus) He cried\, "No no\, O Death in the mornin'\, No no\, Lord\, spare me over in another year."  - Alan Lomax COL channel name VAL TheBWJohnson	0

The record was released in June 1979 on Optional Music with "The Man with the Dogs" as the b-side. The title track was re-recorded for the band's first album\, Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables (1980)\, and the version that appeared on this single\, as well as the single's b-side\, are available on the rarities album Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death (1987).  The lyrics were written by Jello Biafra and John Greenway\, and Biafra composed the music in one of his rare attempts at composing on bass.  This song was featured in the video game Tony Hawk's American Wasteland and as a downloadable song in the Rock Band series. It is also sampled in a song by the dance-punk/big beat trio The Prodigy\, "Dead Ken Beats". The song was also featured in the 2010 film The Social Network.  Meaning  The title is an allusion to the first (and no longer sung) stanza of the national anthem of Germany\, which begins with the words "Deutschland\, Deutschland über alles." (literally\, "Germany\, Germany above all.")  The song focuses on Jerry Brown\, the Governor of California 1975-1983 and 2011--present\, and is sung from his perspective. An imaginary Brown outlines a hippie-fascist vision for America\, in which his "suede denim secret police" kill un-cool people with "organic poison gas" chambers. Lines such as "Serpent's egg already hatched" (a reference to a line from William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar) comment on the corrosive nature of power. The line "now it is 1984" refers to the totalitarian regime of George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four\, describing a future (from 1979) where Jerry Brown has become President Brown presiding over secret police and gas chambers.  Cover versions  Blue Ribbon Glee Club regularly perform their version of the song.  The song was updated by The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy when they released a cover version in 1992 on the album Hypocrisy is the Greatest Legacy. They replaced references to Jerry Brown with references to Pete Wilson.  The song was also widely known in Poland (as "Kalifornia Ponad Wszystko") thanks to the cover by Polish rocker Kazik Staszewski with his band Kazik Na Żywo.  Hasidic New Wave perform a remake of the song on their 1999 album\, Kabalogy. In their version\, titled "Giuliani Über Alles"\, Jerry Brown is replaced by former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani.  The Delgados cover the song in their Peel Sessions CD set.  Six Feet Under do a cover the song on their Graveyard Classics album.  The black metal band Mayhem also covered the song.  Deceased covered the song on their punk covers album Rotten to the Core.  The hardcore band Ceremony has covered the song.  The Who Boys have done a mashup of "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" by Gil Scott-Heron called "Revolution Über Alles".  John Linnell and his band The Statesmen covered it live at least once during his "State Songs" tour\, choosing to perform it because it mentioned the state of California.  Dramarama has recorded a version\, updated in 2003 about California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger... "You will lift weights in school".  A 1986 live recording focused on Ronald Reagan on the album Mutiny On The Bay with live recordings from 1982 and 1986.  Jayne County covered the song with She Wolves about California's Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The green vinyl single was released under artist name Jayne County Meets The She Wolves by the German label Trash 2001.  Mexican death metal band Brujería covers Dead Kennedys with the song "California Uber Aztlan" in 2010. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

COL description VAL (1928 Version Written by Bascom Lamar Lunsford...1939 Version Written by Scott Wiseman)   Lunsford was not only a folklorist but also a lawyer\, who defended clients in criminal cases involving moonshining during the 1920s in North Carolina. He wrote a ballad based on this experience and recorded it in 1928. In 1935\, his friend Scotty Wiseman added the modern chorus and replaced verses about a man appearing in court with verses about making moonshine. Two years later Lunsford sold the song to Wiseman for $25 so he could buy a train ticket back to North Carolina from the National Folk Festival in Chicago. Wiseman copyrighted the song and made sure 50% of the royalties earned were given to Lunsford until his death.

This one was uploaded originally in Mar 20\, 2011 - 6\,231views)  ------------------------  "Sunday Girl" is a 1978 song written and recorded by the American group Blondie. The track was a no. 1 hit in the UK Singles Chart for three weeks in May 1979\, but despite this was not released as a single in the United States.  Song information  The song was written by Chris Stein and was the fourth single to be taken from the album\, Parallel Lines\, in the UK and most other parts of the world. The single had an unusual release in Australia\, with some dispute among fans as to whether it reached no. 1 there or failed to chart. This is because of its initial release as the lead single from Parallel Lines\, due to its being reminiscent of "In The Flesh"\, Blondie's first hit in Australia. "Sunday Girl" failed to chart\, however\, and was later re-released as a double A-side with "Heart of Glass"\, on the back of its UK success. As a result\, it was eclipsed by the disco track\, and is rarely recognised as having charted in its own right.  A French-language version of the track was released in the UK on the "Sunday Girl" 12" single; in France and the Netherlands\, it was the B-side of the 7". It also appears on the cassette release of Eat to the Beat. For Blondie's first greatest hits album The Best of Blondie in 1981\, producer Mike Chapman created a special mix which incorporated one verse sung in French. The bilingual version appears on the 2002 compilation Greatest Hits.  In 2010 a remake of this song was made by the English performer Florrie. It had slightly different lyrics and was used for a Nina Ricci perfume commercial. The song was covered in 2013 by the band She & Him on the album Volume 3.  In 2013 Blondie themselves re-recorded the song and offered it to be included in the CBGB's film soundtrack. This version was included on their 2014 compilation album Greatest Hits Deluxe Redux. The compilation was part of a 2-disc set called Blondie 4(0) Ever which included their 10th studio album Ghosts of Download and marked the 40th anniversary of the forming of the band.

Been used in jingles by the sack full\, for Snapple\, and tonsils\, and folks who've passed away.  Yeah you can hear me on the iPods\, in hot rods\, in old Saabs or any kind of car. But never on All Things Considered\, or  Morning Edition\, no not on NPR.  I get royalties\, from Israel and Iran\, India and Spain\, France and Uzbekistan. I still hope some day\, to become a star\, But it sure won't be\, thanks to NPR.  I've been compared to Tom T. Hall\, Jackie Mason\, Jimmy Rodgers\, Shel Silverstein and Mark Twain. But if you listened just to NPR\, like I do\, you'd prob'ly never hear my name again. Hundreds of thousands of plays of videos\, on radio\, country & rock\, Google me sometime\, son. But I'm not literary or exotic\, neurotic\, a film star or descended from one..  I'm not paranoid\, enough to think they fear it\, But as far as my stuff\, they just won't go near it. Not trying to burn bridges\, but I'll go so far\, As to say you'll hear me\, never on NPR.  Yes I've been compared to Loudon Wainwright\, yes that's right\, Townes VannZandt\, Phil Ochs & Bobby Bare. Not only that / to Paul Craft\, Ray Stevens / yes even to the man himself\,Tom Leher. And my friend BuDDy has been hallowed by James Fallows and Dave Barry\, but never by Steve Inskeep.

Lo que atrae de los covers como siempre e dicho\, es la curiosidad de como se escucha tal cancion con tal vocalista\, el morbo de escuchar una cancion tocada por diferentes personas.  Para disfrutar de este recopilatoria\, tienes que quitarte la imagen de como es la cancion\, no esperes algo igual o "muy parecido"\, recordemos que cada musico aporta algo que hace unica cualquier cancion\, ya sea un cover como es este caso.  Como se observa en la track list\, hay una gran variedad de musicos\, entre ellos vi a Paul Di'anno\, que como todos saben fue ex-integrante de Iron Maiden\, no podian faltar Lemmy o Ripper\, tambien veo a chuck de testament\, tambien esta Chris Jericho de WWE que la neta yo ni sabia que tenia una banda.  En fin hay para todos los gustos\, lo unico malo que vi en el disco es que faltaron algunos temas. COL channel name VAL el juanito	0

COL title VAL You're the Inspiration COL performer VAL Relient K	COL video title VAL Sonny James - Endlessly (The Johnny Cash Show - Jan 27\, 1971) COL description VAL Sonny James\, the Southern Gentleman\, used the popular Nashville sound of the '60s to countrify pop hits of the past into a form accessible to many\, broadening country music's appeal across the nation. James even moved over to the pop charts for a time in the late '50s but found the secret of his success by the time he returned to country. During the late '60s\, he scored an incredible five-year run of number one singles which locked up the top spot for a combined 45 weeks during the late '60s.   Born James Loden on May 1\, 1929\, he began performing with his show-business family at the age of three and played with his four sisters as the Loden Family while in his teens. The group appeared around the South and on radio shows like the Louisiana Hayride and Saturday Night Shindig. After spending time overseas during the Korean War\, Loden took Sonny James as his stage name -- after his teenage nickname -- and joined the local bar circuit. He met and played with Chet Atkins\, who later got him a tryout with Capitol Records. The label liked what it heard and offered James a contract.   His first single\, "That's Me Without You\," hit the country Top Ten in early 1953\, but it was three years before "For Rent (One Empty Heart)" became his second big hit. James\, who played guitar on virtually all of his records\, followed up with two 1956 Top Ten near-misses "Twenty Feet of Muddy Water" and "The Cat Came Back." His next single became his biggest hit: "Young Love" spent nine weeks at number one during 1956-1957 and crossed over to top the pop charts also.   Beginning in 1957\, James began to focus his attention on the popular charts. "First Date\, First Kiss\, First Love" made the Top 25\, but no follow-up placed as high. Several of his failures had still managed to go Top Ten on the country charts\, so James returned to country with a vengeance in 1964. "You're the Only World I Know" hit number one country late that year and spent four weeks atop the chart.   That began one of the greatest tears country music has ever known: 21 of his next 25 singles hit number one (and the other four near-misses hit either two or three). James completely dominated the chart from 1964 to 1972\, though only several singles crossed over for modest placements on the popular charts. That fact is somewhat surprising\, since three-quarters of James' number ones had previously been pop hits\, including "Take Good Care of Her" for Adam Wade\, "I'll Never Find Another You" and "A World of Our Own" for the Seekers\, "Born to Be With You" for the Chordettes\, and Roy Orbison's "Only the Lonely." Backed by his Southern Gentlemen band\, James toured the country and overseas\, appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show\, Hee Haw\, and The Bob Hope Show\, and made several movies\, including Las Vegas Hillbillies (1966)\, Second Fiddle to a Steel Guitar (1967)\, and Nashville Rebel (1967). Billboard named him the Number One Artist of 1969.   Even after James' number one streak ended in January 1972\, he continued to place high on the charts. The number two "Only Love Can Break a Heart" (a pop hit for Gene Pitney ten years earlier) was followed by the number ones "That's Why I Love You Like I Do" and -- after moving to Columbia in mid-1972 -- "When the Snow Is on the Roses." James' next chart-topping single\, "Is It Wrong (For Loving You)\," was released in March 1974\, and it began his last major run. He followed with four consecutive Top Ten hits\, "A Mi Esposa con Amor (To My Wife With Love)\," "A Little Bit South of Saskatoon\," "Little Band of Gold\," and "What in the World's Come Over You."   By the early '70s\, James had moved into producing and music publishing also; he oversaw three of Marie Osmond's albums and still managed occasional Top Tens himself. He picked up the prestigious award of Country Music's Male Artist of the Decade from Record World in 1977 and moved to the Monument label in 1979\, then to Dimension two years later. He retired in 1983\, and now raises cattle in Alabama.   ~ John Bush\, All Music Guide  PLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels\, Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

COL title VAL I'm Blue COL performer VAL André Hazes	COL video title VAL The Newbeats -_I'm Blue - (The Gong-Gong)_1964 Hickory.wmv COL description VAL Texan Larry Henley first performed with the Dean and Marc Combo in 1962. Business links with Nashville-based Hickory Records owner Wesley Rose rapidly led to solo releases by Larry Henley and also\, Dean and Marc.  In June 1964\, Larry\, Dean and Marc got together and cut an unusual\, falsetto-driven demo of the Everly Brothers' "Bye Bye Love." The song's composer\, Bouldleaux Bryant\, heard the dazzling demo and immediately convinced Wesley Rose to sign the trio to a separate\, (third!) recording contract. Fred Foster\, owner of Monument Records\, suggested the "Newbeats" name.  Holland Picture Sleeve - Bye Bye Love was never released on 45 in the USA  "Bye Bye Love\," "Break Away (From That Boy)" (later a #34 hit in Cash Box) and the Chevrolet Corvair tune "Tough Little Buggy" were duly recorded on June 28\, 1964. At the last minute Rose's brother-in-law suggested a song called "Bread And Butter." Dean Mathis created a new\, authoritative arrangement on the spot\, showcasing Larry Henley's scorching\, gospel-influenced falsetto.  When released\, "Bread And Butter" was buried on the 'B' side of "Tough Little Buggy." But DJs at Detroit's WKNR radio flipped the single and "Bread And Butter" blasted onto the WKNR survey the week of July 16\, 1964\, soon peaking at #1.  Nationally "Bread And Butter" shot to #2 and attained Gold sales.  The Newbeats' jaw-dropping national TV debut took place Wednesday\, September 30\, 1964 on ABC-TV's 'Shindig.'  An appearance on 'American Bandstand' came next. The group then stormed Europe via Holland's 'Grand Gala du Disque 1964\,' a widely seen\, four hour television spectacular.   Billboard September 12\, 1964  In addition to "A Patent On Love" (originally intended for Joey "Midnight Mary" Powers) and "Pink Dally Rue" (later recorded by Jimmy Elledge and Robin Wilson)\, the 'Bread & Butter' album included "Thou Shalt Not Steal\," penned by longtime Hickory confederate John D. Loudermilk ("Norman\," "Talk Back Trembling Lips"). Dick and Deedee recognized the potential of the album cut and soon lodged a version of "Thou Shalt Not Steal" at #13 on the charts (Warner single 5482). Another Loudermilk tune\, the #16 "Everything's Alright\," became the Newbeats' follow-up to "Bread And Butter."  From January 22 through February 13\, 1965\, the Newbeats toured Australia and New Zealand with the Rolling Stones\, Roy Orbison and Rolf Harris. During the tour\, Larry Henley became very close to Mick Jagger and the two even planned an album project. Hickory owner Wesley Rose managed tour headliner Roy Orbison. The Newbeats later recorded Orbison's "Oh\, Pretty Woman" and "Lookin' For Love."  "(The Bees Are For The Birds) The Birds Are For The Bees\," was written by the composers of "Bread And Butter\," Larry Parks and Jay Turnbow\, with help from Bob Finnicum. While "Bread And Butter" had referred to sex in sympathetic gastronomic terms\, the refreshingly naïve "Birds Are For The Bees" found Larry Henley (27)\, Dean Mathis (28) and Marc Mathis (25) innocently claiming\, "Grown-ups tell me the birds and the bees do other things than live in trees" and concluding\, to the astonishment of angst-ridden teen listeners\, "I don't care if they can fly it's got nothing to do with you and I."  Issued with two different front covers\, the April 1965 album 'Big Beat Sounds' showcased the Newbeats' most recent single sides. The aforementioned Larry Parks\, Jay Turnbow and Bob Finnicum contributed three additional quirky tunes to the album. 'Big Beat Sounds' also contained valuable material such as Goffin and King's lead-off cut "I Can't Hear You No More" and Keith Colley and Nancie Mantz's closer "Human Kindness."  Colley and Mantz had penned tunes for Rick Nelson ("That's All She Wrote")\, Bobby Bare ("Talk Me Some Sense") and Skeeter Davis ("Ladder Of Success"). Nanci Mantz later co-wrote several songs for the Electric Prunes\, including "I Had Too Much To Dream (Last Night)."  The driving "Little Child" was released as a single in the summer of 1965. Oddly\, it did not drive the national charts wild. But the group's publicity blitz continued unabated with appearances on ABC-TV's 'Where The Action Is' on July 20 and August 25\, 1965.  The Newbeats scored a major comeback with the September 1965 single\, "Run\, Baby Run." The #12 hit boasted exquisite vocal harmonies and a stomping Motown beat. And "Run\, Baby Run" had legs; in 1971 it went Top Ten in England. Roy Orbison and the Tremelos even cut versions of the influential tune.  November 1965 saw 'Run\, Baby Run\,' the Newbeats' third and final Hickory album. Remakes of the Isley Brothers' "This Old Heart" and the Supremes' "Come See About Me" boldly demonstrated the influence of Motown soul while covers of "Help" and "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction" recognized the Beatles and Rolling Stones.

COL title VAL A Strange Way to Save the World COL performer VAL Jump5	COL video title VAL Gene Austin - Wedding Bells Are Breaking Up That Old Gang Of Mine 1929 COL description VAL Victor 21893 - This Song Peaked On US Music Charts At #8 In 1929 Gene Austin (June 24\, 1900 -- January 24\, 1972) was an American singer and songwriter\, one of the first "crooners". His 1920s compositions "When My Sugar Walks Down the Street" and "The Lonesome Road" became pop and jazz standards. Austin was born as Lemeul Eugene Lucas in Gainesville\, Texas (north of Dallas)\, to Nova Lucas (died 1943) and the former Serena Belle Harrell (died 1956). He took the name "Gene Austin" from his stepfather\, Jim Austin\, a blacksmith. Austin grew up in Minden\, the seat of Webster Parish in northwestern Louisiana\, located east of Shreveport. There he learned to play piano and guitar. He ran away from home at 15 and attended a vaudeville act in Houston\, Texas\, where the audience was allowed to come to the stage and sing. On a dare from his friends\, Austin took the stage and sang for the first time since singing as a Southern Baptist choir boy. The audience response was overwhelming\, and the vaudeville company immediately offered him a billed spot on their ticket. Austin joined the U.S. Army at the age of 17 in hopes of being dispatched to Europe to fight in World War I. He was first stationed in New Orleans\, where he played the piano at night in the city's notorious vice district. His familiarity with horses from helping his stepfather in his blacksmithing business also prompted the Army to assign Austin to the cavalry and send him to Mexico with General John Pershing's Pancho Villa expedition\, for which he was awarded the Mexican Service Medal. Thereafter\, he served in France in the Great War. On returning to the United States in 1919\, Austin settled in Baltimore\, Maryland\, where he intended to study dentistry. Soon\, however\, he was playing piano and singing in local taverns. He started writing songs and formed a vaudeville act with Roy Bergere\, with whom he wrote "How Come You Do Me Like You Do." The act ended when Bergere married. Austin worked briefly in a club owned by Lou Clayton\, who later was a part of the famous vaudeville team Clayton\, Jackson and Durante. Gene Austin was an important pioneer crooner whose records in their day enjoyed record sales and the highest circulation. The Genial Texan ex-vaudevillian and would-be screen idol\, Austin constitutes an underrated landmark in popular music history. He made a substantial number of influential recordings from the mid-1920s including a string of best-sellers. In 1956\, CBS made a television drama about Austin's life. In 1962\, Austin campaigned unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for governor of Nevada. He polled only 5\,017 votes (10.21 percent) to his opponent\, Grant Sawyer\, who received 40\,168 ballots (81.4 percent) Sawyer then won the governorship by a nearly 2-1 margin over weak Republican opposition in the fall campaign. Austin had retired to Palm Springs\, in the late 1950s and had been active in civic boards there until 1970. Income from his record sales allowed him to live comfortably the rest of his life. He died in Palm Springs of lung cancer and was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale\, California. He was a godfather of country singer David Houston\, who like Austin also lived in Minden\, Louisiana\, during his youth. "Wedding Bells Are Breaking Up (That Old Gang Of Mine)" is a popular barbershop song\, also known as just "That Old Gang Of Mine". The song laments the loss of childhood friendships when growing up into adulthood. The music was written by Sammy Fain and the lyrics by Irving Kahal and Willie Raskin. The song was published in 1929. COL channel name VAL warholsoup100	0

The song was the band's first single\, released in August 1979\, and is often considered to be the first gothic rock record released. It did not enter the UK pop charts at that time. The b-side features the song "Boys" and some versions also include an early demo recording of what would be their next single\, "Dark Entries". It was released on CD in 1988 and was compiled on the 1998 album\, Crackle - The Best of Bauhaus. The original sleeve art was taken from a still of the film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.  Recording session  "Bela Lugosi's Dead" was recorded during a six-hour session at Beck Studios in Wellingborough on 26 January 1979. Four more songs were recorded ("Boys"\, "Harry"\, "Dark Entries" and the unreleased "Some Faces") but not used; only "Harry" surfaced in 1982 as a single B-side to "Kick In The Eye".  The song "Boys" was re-recorded at Beck Studios in spring 1979.  Use in film and television  The song was featured in the 1983 Tony Scott cult vampire film The Hunger\, with Bauhaus portraying a band in a nightclub\, playing it during the opening credits and introduction. A 7" promotional record featuring an edited version of the song was released to theaters playing the movie.  It was also played throughout the movie Dead Man's Curve/The Curve\, and featured in the French movie\, Sombre. The song is played in the movie Good Luck Chuck as an introduction for when the Goth girl is on screen and it is on the soundtrack.  The song was used as the intro music for the late 1990s Saturday Night Live skit "Goth Talk"\, which had Chris Kattan and Molly Shannon as two goth students. This song was also in an episode in the fifth season of Smallville\, the vampire/Halloween-themed "Thirst". The song was also in an episode of One Tree Hill.  The song was featured in an episode ("Midnight") of the science fiction/horror series Fringe which revolved around a vampire-esque creature.  Comedian and musician Bill Bailey parodied the song on his DVD Cosmic Jam as part of a medley in which he and his band\, the Stan Ellis Experiment performed Cockney Rock style versions of popular songs - this particular segment of the medley included lyrical changes such as "E ad a girl's name".  The song was played almost in its entirety during the horror film The Collector during a scene in which the older daughter was attempting to have sex with her boyfriend before they were both viciously murdered.  The song was played in the opening scene of the Supernatural television series in season 6\, episode 5\, "Live Free or Twi-Hard". The episode is vampire-themed\, poking particular fun at the Twilight movie series and its romanticism of vampires.  The Illuminoids made a mash-up called Lugosi's Mongoloid Loser with Bela Lugosi's Dead by Bauhaus\, Loser by Beck and Mongolid By Devo.  Ethan Gold also covered it. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

Fools Fall In Love  ------------------------  "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" is a song by American punk rock band Green Day. It was released as the second single from their seventh album\, American Idiot. The song was written by Green Day\, with lyrics by lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong. The single peaked at number two in the United States\, making it Green Day's most successful song.  Influences and covers  Noel Gallagher of Oasis criticized Green Day in late 2006\, saying\, "They should have the decency to wait until I am dead [before stealing my songs]. I\, at least\, pay the people I steal from that courtesy"\, referencing the fact that "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" uses the same chord progression as Oasis's hit single "Wonderwall". Gallagher's reaction may have partly been due to the emergence of "Boulevard of Broken Songs"\, a popular mash-up mixed by San Francisco DJ and producer Party Ben in late 2004. The mix consisted of elements from "Boulevard of Broken Dreams"\, "Wonderwall"\, Travis' "Writing to Reach You" and Eminem's "Sing for the Moment"\, which itself has samples from Aerosmith's "Dream On" (another remix by Party Ben featured this\, "Wonderwall" and Kanye West's "Flashing Lights"). This song was covered by Japanese-American singer Hikaru Utada acoustically with a guitar during an internet broadcast in December 2005; a video of it can be found. "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" is sung first and then fades into "Passion" (After the Battle version) from the Kingdom Hearts II original soundtrack. "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" is also featured in the movie trailer of Lords of Dogtown (2005)\, starring Heath Ledger\, Emile Hirsch and John Robinson. Billie Joe Armstrong wrote the song while he was in his son Joey's bedroom.[citation needed] In the 2005 VH1 Storytellers program featuring Green Day\, Billie Joe Armstrong stated that the title of the song was "nicked" from the famous Gottfried Helnwein painting of the same title\, which features James Dean. Four earlier songs also have the same title: an old Harry Warren song\, a Hanoi Rocks song\, a Marianne Faithfull song\, and song by Brian Setzer from his 1986 album The Knife Feels Like Justice Lyrics from the song bear some resemblance to the Pinhead Gunpowder song "I Walk Alone"\, a band in which Billie Joe Armstrong also sings. It appeared on their 1997 album\, Goodbye Ellston Avenue. The song also shares some lyrics with the Whitesnake song "Here I Go Again"\, the words "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" can be found in the lyrics of the Elvis Costello song "Brilliant Mistake"\, the Allman Brothers Band song "End of the Line"\, the Deadsy song "The Key to Gramercy Park"\, and The Ataris song "Road Signs and Rock Songs". The phrase "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" also appears in punk/new wave band Blondie's 1982 minor UK-hit single Island of Lost Souls. A live version of the song can be found on Bullet in a Bible\, a live album of Green Day performing at the Milton Keynes National Bowl. Bluegrass band Cornbread Red did a cover of the song on a tribute album to Green Day Pickin' on Green Day\, while the German choir Gregorian did a cover\, on their Masters of Chant Chapter V album\, in the style of a Gregorian Chant. Mark Mallman covered this song on his MP3-only compilation release Outtakes Vol 1. The song is also featured in Green Day's musical American Idiot\, sung on the cast recording by John Gallagher Jr.\, Rebecca Naomi Jones\, and the rest of the company.

Originally made legendary by some of the south's best rock bands\, Charlie adds his own unique sound to each song. Originals\, live and studio versions make this collection live up to its' name by being a great one to pull out during a "Tailgate Party."   Description      13 Tracks previously released in 1999     Engineered\, Produced and Mixed by: Ron W. Griffin     Executive Producer: David Corlew  Guide Review - Charlie Daniels Band - Tailgate Party  Included on this very southern rock flavored collection are live versions of "The Legend of Wooley Swamp" and "The Devil Went Down to Georgia." With both songs being so well known and played a gazillion times\, it was refreshing to hear them live and just slightly different from what we are normally accustomed to.  "The South's Gonna Do It Again" had an added bonus to it by having a very early on in his career performance by Keith Urban\, showing us some very impressive guitar solo's. Remakes of ZZ Top's "Sharp Dressed Man" and Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Freebird" were very captivating and showed off some incredible fiddle playing by Charlie. Probably one of my most favorites was CDB's remake of the song made famous by Hootie and the Blowfish\, "Let Her Cry." Charlie has always been well known for his playing but under rated for his vocals. This song shows off just how well he can deliver some very heartfelt emotions and I really enjoyed listening to this new version.  If you have ever appreciated CDB\, you will really like this release. If for nothing else\, the diversity of the genre's and CDB being able to add the country sound without destroying the memory of the song.

This has Noel Boggs on Steel\, which means after the war probably 1946. Alex Beshear on trumpet plays it without a mute.  That was quite unusual for him.  Also Tommy sings it.  When Bob made the Okey 78\, the vocalist was Danny Alguire\, who also played trumpet.  Tommy had joined the army when that session took play. So here we get to hear the way he would have done it.  Just wish the quality was better.  Notice the accordian?  Bob never used one in his recordings\, and I have to wonder where Noel plugged in his steel guitar.  Behind a tree?  Hot session\, though.

COL title VAL Caledonia COL performer VAL Celtic Woman	COL video title VAL LURLEAN HUNTER  Vocal Jazz Swing. Steppin' Out With My Baby \, I Feel COL description VAL Lurlean Hunter  Singer Lurlean Hunter made five albums on her own during the second half of the '50s\, starting out as a Lonesome Gal on RCA and winding up still feeling Blue & Sentimental for Atlantic. She was discovered in Chicago where she had been singing in many clubs\, including a collaboration with drummer Red Saunders that held forth at the Club DeLisa. Hunter's move to New York City in 1955 was prompted by RCA's interest in recording her. The singer's recording career actually began before she left the Windy City at the behest of indie jazz labels\, some of them quite short-lived -- such as Seymour\, with a catalog topping out at four releases. The press described Hunter as a "blues thrush" in announcing her interpretations of three numbers actually written by the label's owner\, producer and record store owner Seymour Schwartz. The latter promotional blurb inevitably told some truth about Hunter's stylistic traits\, if not her relation to winged fauna. Her recordings were more about rhythm & blues and pop than jazz\, yet were done in an era when such sessions often involved fine mainstream jazz players in the accompaniment. The 1956Night Life\, for example\, featured pianist Hank Jones and tenor saxophonist Al Cohn. Blue & Sentimental -- with arrangements by the progressive Jimmy Giuffre -- was reissued in 2000 as a split CD also including an album by fellow singer Betty Bennett\, a former wife of pianist André Previn.Hunter's final recordings were done in 1964\, at which point she was still well under 40 years old. She is known to have died young\, although details of this tragedy are murky. In one version of the story she was knocked off by a mobster lover\, yet whether anybody was really that mean to Lurlean cannot be completely confirmed.

COL performer VAL The Litter	COL video title VAL Sixteen Horsepower w/ Bertrand Cantat - The Partisan COL description VAL The song about the French Resistance in World War II was written in 1943 in London by Emmanuel d'Astier de la Vigerie and the music by Anna Marly.  The english lyrics (well known by the classic Leonard Cohen cover) were written by Hy Zaret.  Bertrand Cantat of Noir Desir provides some french vocals...  LYRICS When they poured across the border I was cautioned to surrender\, this I could not do; I took my gun and vanished.  I have changed my name so often\, I've lost my wife and children but I have many friends\, and some of them are with me.  An old woman gave us shelter\, Kept us hidden in the garret\, then the soldiers came; she died without a whisper.  There were three of us this morning I'm the only one this evening but I must go on; the frontiers are my prison.  Oh\, the wind\, the wind is blowing\, through the graves the wind is blowing\, freedom soon will come; then we'll come from the shadows.  Les Allemands étaient chez moi\, ils me dirent\, "Résigne toi\," mais je n'ai pas peur; j'ai repris mon âme.  (The Germans were at my home They said\, "Sign yourself\," But I am not afraid I have retaken my soul.)  J'ai changé cent fois de nom\, j'ai perdu femme et enfants mais j'ai tant d'amis; j'ai la France entière.  (I've changed names a hundred times I have lost wife and children But I have so many friends I have all of France)  Un vieil homme dans un grenier pour la nuit nous a caché\, les Allemands l'ont pris; il est mort sans surprise.  (An old man\, in an attic Hid us for the night The Germans captured him He died without surprise.)

Joey DeFrancesco Composed: Sam Jones Cd: "Like That"\, Recording Date: August 30\, 1995 - August 31\, 1995  Release Date: April 30\, 1996   Subscribe Here: http://www.youtube.com/user/TheSouLighting http://www.facebook.com/thesoulighting  Jimmy Bruno\, born July 22\, 1953 in Philadelphia\, Pennsylvania\, is a master jazz guitarist and jazz educator. He started playing at the age of 7. He began his professional career at the age of 19\, touring with Buddy Rich. Among his many credits\, he is the only guitarist to have ever led Frank Sinatra's band. He played for many years in Los Angeles before returning to the Philadelphia area. He counts Johnny Smith\, Hank Garland\, Joe Pass\, Tal Farlow\, Wes Montgomery\, Howard Roberts\, Jim Hall\, and Pat Martino amongst his influences. In March\, 2011 Jimmy opened up Jimmy Bruno's Guitar Workshop\, a website that allows students to learn directly from Jimmy through video lessons.  For more information: http://jimmybruno.com/biography.php  Although Like That was recorded in New York\, many of the people involved with the project were Philadelphians. The pleasing hard bop date unites Jimmy Bruno's Philly-based trio of the 1990s (which includes bassist Craig Thomas and drummer Steve Holloway) with organist/trumpeter and Philly native Joey DeFrancesco\, Although DeFrancesco plays organ on most of the 11 songs\, he switches to the trumpet and favors a Miles Davis-influenced mute on relaxed versions of "There Is No Greater Love" and "Stars Fell on Alabama."   Ο Jimmy Bruno γεννήθηκε στις 22 Ιουλίου 1953\, στην Πενσυλβάνια και είναι ένας Αμερικανός master κιθαρίστας και διδάσκαλος της τζαζ. Παίζει από ηλικία 7 ετών και ξεκίνησε την επαγγελματική του καριέρα στην ηλικία των 19\, περιοδεύοντας με τον Buddy Rich. Μεταξύ των πολλών του διακρίσεων\, είναι ότι ήταν ο μόνος επικεφαλής κιθαρίστας της μπάντας του Frank Sinatra. Έπαιξε για πολλά χρόνια στο Λος Άντζελες πριν από την επιστροφή στην  Φιλαδέλφεια. Έχει επηρεαστεί\, μεταξύ άλλων\, από τους  Johnny Smith\, Hank Garland\, Joe Pass\, Tal Farlow\, Wes Montgomery\, Howard Roberts\, Jim Hall\, and Pat Martino. Από τον Μάρτιο του 2011\, άνοιξε την ιστοσελίδα: Jimmy Bruno's Guitar Workshop\,  που επιτρέπει στους μαθητές του να εξασκηθούν απευθείας από τον Bruno μέσω βίντεο μαθημάτων. Περισσότερες πληροφορίες: http://jimmybruno.com/biography.php  Το μουσικό κομμάτι “Unit Seven” είναι το από το cd του 1996 με τίτλο “Like That”\, που ηχογραφήθηκε στη Νέα Υόρκη και οι περισσότεροι μουσικοί ήταν από την Φιλαδέλφεια. Στο βασικό του τρίο (με μπάσσο τον Craig Thomas και ντράμμερ τον Steve Holloway) της περιόδου του 1990\, προστέθηκε ο  οργανίστας/τρομπετίστας Joey DeFrancesco (επίσης από την Φιλαδέλφεια).  Ο Joey DeFrancesco παίζει όργανο στα περισσότερα από τα 11 κομμάτια\, αλλά και τρομπέτα βαθειά επηρεασμένος από τον τρόπο του Miles Davis (κυρίως στα "There Is No Greater Love" και "Stars Fell on Alabama.")

COL title VAL Don't Ever Go Away (Por Causa de Você) COL performer VAL Eliane Elias	COL video title VAL Drop Down Mama - "Sleepy" John Estes. COL description VAL Here's a record I bought in the 1950's when going through my 'duffel coat\, roll-neck sweater\, corduroy trousers and sandals' phase. (A real "mouldy fig"\, as the sharp suited 'modern' jazz fans called us 'trad' fans.) It is one of the recordings sponsored by "The Jazz Appreciation Society" and features Sleepy John in typical form and accompanied by Hammie Nixon on harmonica. Born John Adam Estes\, to a sharecropper family in Ripley Tennessee on the 25th. Jan. 1904\, his life was complicated from the start. One of a family of ten\, at the age of six he lost his right eye in a baseball accident. As his father was a guitarist\, he grew up with similar interests and made himself cigar-box guitars to play from the early days. He went totally blind in 1950\, and had gained the sobriquet "sleepy" from a chronic blood pressure disorder which led to fits of narcolepsy\, which caused him to drop off to sleep without warning\, sometimes standing up! He was "rediscovered" during the blues revival in 1962\, after a long and varied career through the 1920's and 30's. He died on the 5th. June 1977 COL channel name VAL Clive Dellino	0

COL title VAL I Can Cook Too COL performer VAL Jane Duboc	COL video title VAL Sonny James - Endlessly (The Johnny Cash Show - Jan 27\, 1971) COL description VAL Sonny James\, the Southern Gentleman\, used the popular Nashville sound of the '60s to countrify pop hits of the past into a form accessible to many\, broadening country music's appeal across the nation. James even moved over to the pop charts for a time in the late '50s but found the secret of his success by the time he returned to country. During the late '60s\, he scored an incredible five-year run of number one singles which locked up the top spot for a combined 45 weeks during the late '60s.   Born James Loden on May 1\, 1929\, he began performing with his show-business family at the age of three and played with his four sisters as the Loden Family while in his teens. The group appeared around the South and on radio shows like the Louisiana Hayride and Saturday Night Shindig. After spending time overseas during the Korean War\, Loden took Sonny James as his stage name -- after his teenage nickname -- and joined the local bar circuit. He met and played with Chet Atkins\, who later got him a tryout with Capitol Records. The label liked what it heard and offered James a contract.   His first single\, "That's Me Without You\," hit the country Top Ten in early 1953\, but it was three years before "For Rent (One Empty Heart)" became his second big hit. James\, who played guitar on virtually all of his records\, followed up with two 1956 Top Ten near-misses "Twenty Feet of Muddy Water" and "The Cat Came Back." His next single became his biggest hit: "Young Love" spent nine weeks at number one during 1956-1957 and crossed over to top the pop charts also.   Beginning in 1957\, James began to focus his attention on the popular charts. "First Date\, First Kiss\, First Love" made the Top 25\, but no follow-up placed as high. Several of his failures had still managed to go Top Ten on the country charts\, so James returned to country with a vengeance in 1964. "You're the Only World I Know" hit number one country late that year and spent four weeks atop the chart.   That began one of the greatest tears country music has ever known: 21 of his next 25 singles hit number one (and the other four near-misses hit either two or three). James completely dominated the chart from 1964 to 1972\, though only several singles crossed over for modest placements on the popular charts. That fact is somewhat surprising\, since three-quarters of James' number ones had previously been pop hits\, including "Take Good Care of Her" for Adam Wade\, "I'll Never Find Another You" and "A World of Our Own" for the Seekers\, "Born to Be With You" for the Chordettes\, and Roy Orbison's "Only the Lonely." Backed by his Southern Gentlemen band\, James toured the country and overseas\, appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show\, Hee Haw\, and The Bob Hope Show\, and made several movies\, including Las Vegas Hillbillies (1966)\, Second Fiddle to a Steel Guitar (1967)\, and Nashville Rebel (1967). Billboard named him the Number One Artist of 1969.   Even after James' number one streak ended in January 1972\, he continued to place high on the charts. The number two "Only Love Can Break a Heart" (a pop hit for Gene Pitney ten years earlier) was followed by the number ones "That's Why I Love You Like I Do" and -- after moving to Columbia in mid-1972 -- "When the Snow Is on the Roses." James' next chart-topping single\, "Is It Wrong (For Loving You)\," was released in March 1974\, and it began his last major run. He followed with four consecutive Top Ten hits\, "A Mi Esposa con Amor (To My Wife With Love)\," "A Little Bit South of Saskatoon\," "Little Band of Gold\," and "What in the World's Come Over You."   By the early '70s\, James had moved into producing and music publishing also; he oversaw three of Marie Osmond's albums and still managed occasional Top Tens himself. He picked up the prestigious award of Country Music's Male Artist of the Decade from Record World in 1977 and moved to the Monument label in 1979\, then to Dimension two years later. He retired in 1983\, and now raises cattle in Alabama.   ~ John Bush\, All Music Guide  PLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels\, Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

On it\, we can enjoy several Brels: the creator of a universal and timeless body of songs\, of course\, but also the songwriter who was able to delve into the very depths of the human soul\, and the composer whose music swings and grooves thanks to one of the best jazz big bands on the planet.

It was released on the band's fifth full-length studio album\, Document\, and also as a 7" vinyl single in 1987. The song was their first hit single\, reaching #9 in the US Billboard Hot 100\, #14 in Canada\, and later reached #16 in the UK singles chart on its UK release (1991).  The song was included in Activision's Guitar Hero World Tour and is in Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades.  The accompanying video's director was artist Robert Longo.  The director of photography was Alton Brown\, who later became a Food Network chef.  In March 2005\, Q magazine placed "The One I Love" at number 57 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks.  The song is included on R.E.M. Live.  Lyrics and meaning  Many listeners who misunderstand the song's meaning have made the song a popular radio dedication to loved ones\, relying on the main lyric\, "This one goes out to the one I love."  However\, they missed an ensuing line: "A simple prop to occupy my time"; the song was not particularly a love song.  Stipe related in 1987 to Rolling Stone\, "I've always left myself pretty open to interpretation. It's probably better that they just think it's a love song at this point."  However\, in an interview in the January 1988 issue of Musician magazine he said that the song was "incredibly violent" and "It's very clear that it's about using people over and over again".  The song contains only three verses\, which are all near identical\, with small variations each repeat of the verse. (For example "A simple prop to occupy my time"\, "Another prop has occupied my time"). The chorus consists of just the word "fire"\, repeated (with the backing vocal of "She's coming down on her own now/Coming down on her own"\, sung by Mike Mills).  Cover versions  Bush Sufjan Stevens Massacre and many more. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

He came across this young man pickin' on a guitar\, playing it hot an' An' the devil jumped on a hickory stump an' said 'I'll tell ya what' I guess you didn't know it\, I'm a guitar player too\, and if you care to take a dare I make a bet with you. Now you play a real good guitar boy\, but give the devil his due\, I'll bet a guitar of gold against you soul 'cause i think i'm better then you.  The boy said my name's Johnny\, it might be a sin\, i'll take your bet You're gonna regret\, I'm the best I've ever been.  Johnny rosen up your pick an' play your guitar hard 'cause hell's broke loose in scunthorpe an' the devil deals the cards. Now if you win you'll get this shinny guitar made of gold\, but if you loose the devil gets your soul!  The devil opened up his case and said 'i'll start this gig' and fire flew from his finger tips as he rosened up his pick. He strummed the pick across the strings it made an evil hiss Then a band of demons joined in and it sounded somthing like this  When the devil finished Johnny said 'You're pretty good ol' son\, but sit down in that chair right there let me show you how it's done!'  Fire on the mountain run boy's run! Devil's in the house of the risen sun! Chicken in the bread pan picken out dough! Granny does your dog bite\, no child\, no!   The devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat\, and he laid that golden gitar on the ground at Johnny's feet. Johnny said 'devil just come on back if you ever want to try again\, I done told you once you son of a bitch i'm the best I've ever been!'  Fire on the mountain run boy's run!

COL title VAL From the Morning COL performer VAL Nick Drake	COL video title VAL Nine Below Zero - Sonny Boy Williamson (Trumpet) COL description VAL Recorded on December 4\, 1951. Williamson's first recording session took place in 1951 for Lillian McMurry of Jackson\, Mississippi's Trumpet Records\, three years after the death of John Lee Williamson\, which for the first time allowed some legitimacy to Miller's carefully worded claim to being "the one and only Sonny Boy Williamson". McMurry later erected Williamson's headstone\, near Tutwiler\, Mississippi\, in 1977. Checker Records When Trumpet went bankrupt in 1955\, Sonny Boy's recording contract was yielded to its creditors\, who sold it to Chess Records in Chicago\, Illinois. Sonny Boy had begun developing a following in Chicago beginning in 1953\, when he appeared there as a member of Elmore James's band. It was during his Chess years that he enjoyed his greatest success and acclaim\, recording about 70 songs for Chess subsidiary Checker Records from 1955 to 1964. Sonny Boy's first LP record was titled Down and Out Blues and was released by Checker Records in 1959. Ace Records One single\, "Boppin' With Sonny" b/w "No Nights By Myself" was released with Ace Records in 1955.

Hope You ENJOY!!! Warren Smith (February 7\, 1932 -- January 30\, 1980) was an American rockabilly and country music singer and guitarist. Smith was born in Humphreys County\, Mississippi to Iola and Willie Warren Smith\, who divorced when he was young. He was raised by his maternal grandparents in Louise\, Mississippi where they had a small farm and dry goods store. Smith took up the guitar to while away his evenings while in the United States Air Force stationed in San Antonio\, Texas. By the time of his discharge from the service\, he had decided to make a career of music. He moved to West Memphis\, Arkansas and auditioned\, successfully\, to play the Cotton Club\, a local hot spot. Steel guitarist Stan Kessler\, who was playing at that nightclub with the Snearly Ranch Boys\, immediately spotted Smith's potential and took him to Sun Records to audition for Sam Phillips\, with the Snearly Ranch Boys providing backup. Phillips liked what he heard\, and decided that "Rock & Roll Ruby"\, a song credited to Johnny Cash\, would be Smith's first record. (Smith later claimed that "Rock & Roll Ruby" was actually written by George Jones and sold to Cash for $40.) Smith recorded it on February 5\, 1956. Phillips\, who was hedging his bets over whether rock and roll would maintain its popularity\, released that record with a country crooner\, aptly named "I'd Rather Be Safe Than Sorry"\, on the flip side. By May 26\, "Rock & Roll Ruby" had hit No. 1 on the local pop charts. Smith's first record for Sun went on to outsell the first Sun releases by Elvis Presley\, Johnny Cash and Carl Perkins. In August 1956\, Smith went back to the Sun Records studio to record his second release\, "Ubangi Stomp". This infectious rocker had an incorrect lyric including an African chief with the syntax of a movie Indian. For the B side\, Smith recorded the classic ballad "Black Jack David". This song\, which originated in early 18th-century Britain and survived in various forms in the mountains of the American south\, may be the oldest song ever recorded by a rock and roll performer. Although a resounding artistic success\, it did not sell as well as Smith's debut. In 1957\, Smith recorded "So Long\, I'm Gone"\, a song written by Roy Orbison\, and it did become Smith's biggest hit at Sun\, peaking at No. 74 nationally (Billboard). But Sun had no cash to promote it at the same time as Sam Phillips put every dollar Sun had behind Jerry Lee Lewis' "Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin On". Although Smith continued to make rockabilly records for Sun\, including a cover version of Slim Harpo's "Got Love If Your Want It" (recorded in October 1957)\, these records did not do well commercially. Toward the end of 1958\, Smith\, seeing his future in country music\, cut a final record for Sun\, a cover version of Don Gibson's "Sweet Sweet Girl". In spite of a review in Billboard calling it "ultra commercial"\, this record also failed to sell. Like other artists such as Sonny Burgess\, Hayden Thompson\, Billy Lee Riley and Ray Harris\, chart success largely eluded him. Smith then decided to leave Sun Records.

COL title VAL Oh Death COL performer VAL The Kaleidoscope	COL video title VAL Bessie Jones and Georgia Sea Island Singers - O Death COL description VAL In voudun there are gods and demigods of death and of the cemetery who come to the dancing ground and possess some of their worshipers; now vehicles through which the deities can communicate with mortals\, the possessed advise\, gossip\, eat\, dance\, and socialize with the congregants. Thus Bessie Jones's dramatic dialogue between Death and the reluctant sinner might just as well have its roots in an African tradition as in the popular religious poems and dramas of medieval Europe in which death was so frequently personified. Chorus O Death in the mornin'\, (3 times) Spare me over another year. Well\, Death walked up into the sinner's gaze\, Says\, "B'lieve you have waited now a little too late\, Your fever now is one hundred and two\, Have a narrow chance if you ever pull through." (Chorus) He cried\, "O Death\," Cryin'\, "O Death in the mornin'\, O Death\, Death\, spare me over in another year. Hey\, what is this I see\, Cold\, icy hands all over me? You say\, "I am Death\, no one can excel\, I span the doors of Death and Hell." (Chorus) 11 "No\, you heard God's people sing and pray\, You would not heed\, you just walked away\, You would not even bend your knee\, Now you got to come and go with me. (Chorus) "Well\, I'm gon' fix your feet so you cannot walk\, 'M fix your tongue where you cannot talk\, Close your eyes and you cannot see\, And you got to come and go with me." (Chorus) "Well\, Death\, consider my age\, And do not take me in this stage\, Because all of my wealth is at your command\, If you'll just move your cold\, icy hand." (Chorus) He cried\, "No no\, O Death in the mornin'\, No no\, Lord\, spare me over in another year."  - Alan Lomax COL channel name VAL TheBWJohnson	1

The record was released in June 1979 on Optional Music with "The Man with the Dogs" as the b-side. The title track was re-recorded for the band's first album\, Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables (1980)\, and the version that appeared on this single\, as well as the single's b-side\, are available on the rarities album Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death (1987).  The lyrics were written by Jello Biafra and John Greenway\, and Biafra composed the music in one of his rare attempts at composing on bass.  This song was featured in the video game Tony Hawk's American Wasteland and as a downloadable song in the Rock Band series. It is also sampled in a song by the dance-punk/big beat trio The Prodigy\, "Dead Ken Beats". The song was also featured in the 2010 film The Social Network.  Meaning  The title is an allusion to the first (and no longer sung) stanza of the national anthem of Germany\, which begins with the words "Deutschland\, Deutschland über alles." (literally\, "Germany\, Germany above all.")  The song focuses on Jerry Brown\, the Governor of California 1975-1983 and 2011--present\, and is sung from his perspective. An imaginary Brown outlines a hippie-fascist vision for America\, in which his "suede denim secret police" kill un-cool people with "organic poison gas" chambers. Lines such as "Serpent's egg already hatched" (a reference to a line from William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar) comment on the corrosive nature of power. The line "now it is 1984" refers to the totalitarian regime of George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four\, describing a future (from 1979) where Jerry Brown has become President Brown presiding over secret police and gas chambers.  Cover versions  Blue Ribbon Glee Club regularly perform their version of the song.  The song was updated by The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy when they released a cover version in 1992 on the album Hypocrisy is the Greatest Legacy. They replaced references to Jerry Brown with references to Pete Wilson.  The song was also widely known in Poland (as "Kalifornia Ponad Wszystko") thanks to the cover by Polish rocker Kazik Staszewski with his band Kazik Na Żywo.  Hasidic New Wave perform a remake of the song on their 1999 album\, Kabalogy. In their version\, titled "Giuliani Über Alles"\, Jerry Brown is replaced by former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani.  The Delgados cover the song in their Peel Sessions CD set.  Six Feet Under do a cover the song on their Graveyard Classics album.  The black metal band Mayhem also covered the song.  Deceased covered the song on their punk covers album Rotten to the Core.  The hardcore band Ceremony has covered the song.  The Who Boys have done a mashup of "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" by Gil Scott-Heron called "Revolution Über Alles".  John Linnell and his band The Statesmen covered it live at least once during his "State Songs" tour\, choosing to perform it because it mentioned the state of California.  Dramarama has recorded a version\, updated in 2003 about California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger... "You will lift weights in school".  A 1986 live recording focused on Ronald Reagan on the album Mutiny On The Bay with live recordings from 1982 and 1986.  Jayne County covered the song with She Wolves about California's Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The green vinyl single was released under artist name Jayne County Meets The She Wolves by the German label Trash 2001.  Mexican death metal band Brujería covers Dead Kennedys with the song "California Uber Aztlan" in 2010. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

Upon its initial release by Fantasy Records in 1973\, the album was credited to "The Blue Ridge Rangers" with no mention of Fogerty on the cover. Fogerty chose to do this in order to distance himself from his Creedence legacy. The LP was later reissued and credited to John Fogerty with a different cover design. The CD reissue restores the original silhouette cover photo and credits the album to Fogerty. The album is made up entirely of traditional and country covers\, and features Fogerty playing all the instruments. The album peaked at #47 on the charts. Two singles from the album became hits: "Jambalaya" which peaked at #16\, and "Hearts of Stone" which peaked at #37. In 2009\, Fogerty released a sequel to this album\, entitled The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again.  Track listing Side one 1. "Blue Ridge Mountain Blues" (Traditional) -- 2:29 2.

He came across this young man pickin' on a guitar\, playing it hot an' An' the devil jumped on a hickory stump an' said 'I'll tell ya what' I guess you didn't know it\, I'm a guitar player too\, and if you care to take a dare I make a bet with you. Now you play a real good guitar boy\, but give the devil his due\, I'll bet a guitar of gold against you soul 'cause i think i'm better then you.

Now if you win you'll get this shinny guitar made of gold\, but if you loose the devil gets your soul!  The devil opened up his case and said 'i'll start this gig' and fire flew from his finger tips as he rosened up his pick. He strummed the pick across the strings it made an evil hiss Then a band of demons joined in and it sounded somthing like this  When the devil finished Johnny said 'You're pretty good ol' son\, but sit down in that chair right there let me show you how it's done!'  Fire on the mountain run boy's run! Devil's in the house of the risen sun! Chicken in the bread pan picken out dough! Granny does your dog bite\, no child\, no!   The devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat\, and he laid that golden gitar on the ground at Johnny's feet.

Another Girl Another Planet is featured on The Coal Porters new album\, No. 6. No. 6\, is produced by John Wood\, the legendary British folk-rock mastermind who recorded the classic albums of Fairport Convention\, Nick Drake\, Beth Orton and Squeeze. No. 6 is a bit of a departure for the Coal Porters as it pushes their musical boundaries further than ever before.The Coal Porters - No. 6  https://thecoalporters.com / https://thecoalporters.bandcamp.com / https://www.facebook.com/thecoalporters  This new album features Kerenza quadruple tracking herself into a string quartet\, Andrew on a ukulele\, Sid on trusty autoharp and mandolin\, both Neil and Paul on dobro\, a Byrdsy acoustic 12-string guitar\, and very emotional\, long\, sweet trumpet solo by Cuba’s noted “son y mambo” music virtuoso Eikel Venegas. There has never been music like this before. And already\, the album’s opening track\, Sid’s “The Day The Last Ramone Died\,” is being hailed as a classic.  Recorded in two creative bursts in late 2014 and in 2015 this is the Coal Porters album which took three years to incubate. Four new Sid songs\, three new Neil Bob Herd originals\, and Kerenza Peacock contributed her first recorded lead vocal on a very personal song with Play A Tune while also gracing the record with a totally catchy instrumental\, Chopping The Garlic. The album goes out on a high note with the band’s warm-hearted cover of the Only Ones’ classic hit Another Girl\, Another Planet.  No.6 was released in September 2016 and can be ordered via Amazon\, iTunes\, the Sid Griffin website and in all good records stores.  Read more about No. 6 at http://www.sidgriffin.com/2016/09/06/the-coal-porters-no-6/  The Coal Porters are also on facebook at http://www.facebook.com/The-Coal-Porters COL channel name VAL The Coal Porters	0

COL title VAL Endlessly COL performer VAL Mavis Staples	COL video title VAL Sonny James - Endlessly (The Johnny Cash Show - Jan 27\, 1971) COL description VAL Sonny James\, the Southern Gentleman\, used the popular Nashville sound of the '60s to countrify pop hits of the past into a form accessible to many\, broadening country music's appeal across the nation. James even moved over to the pop charts for a time in the late '50s but found the secret of his success by the time he returned to country. During the late '60s\, he scored an incredible five-year run of number one singles which locked up the top spot for a combined 45 weeks during the late '60s.   Born James Loden on May 1\, 1929\, he began performing with his show-business family at the age of three and played with his four sisters as the Loden Family while in his teens. The group appeared around the South and on radio shows like the Louisiana Hayride and Saturday Night Shindig. After spending time overseas during the Korean War\, Loden took Sonny James as his stage name -- after his teenage nickname -- and joined the local bar circuit. He met and played with Chet Atkins\, who later got him a tryout with Capitol Records. The label liked what it heard and offered James a contract.   His first single\, "That's Me Without You\," hit the country Top Ten in early 1953\, but it was three years before "For Rent (One Empty Heart)" became his second big hit. James\, who played guitar on virtually all of his records\, followed up with two 1956 Top Ten near-misses "Twenty Feet of Muddy Water" and "The Cat Came Back." His next single became his biggest hit: "Young Love" spent nine weeks at number one during 1956-1957 and crossed over to top the pop charts also.   Beginning in 1957\, James began to focus his attention on the popular charts. "First Date\, First Kiss\, First Love" made the Top 25\, but no follow-up placed as high. Several of his failures had still managed to go Top Ten on the country charts\, so James returned to country with a vengeance in 1964. "You're the Only World I Know" hit number one country late that year and spent four weeks atop the chart.   That began one of the greatest tears country music has ever known: 21 of his next 25 singles hit number one (and the other four near-misses hit either two or three). James completely dominated the chart from 1964 to 1972\, though only several singles crossed over for modest placements on the popular charts. That fact is somewhat surprising\, since three-quarters of James' number ones had previously been pop hits\, including "Take Good Care of Her" for Adam Wade\, "I'll Never Find Another You" and "A World of Our Own" for the Seekers\, "Born to Be With You" for the Chordettes\, and Roy Orbison's "Only the Lonely." Backed by his Southern Gentlemen band\, James toured the country and overseas\, appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show\, Hee Haw\, and The Bob Hope Show\, and made several movies\, including Las Vegas Hillbillies (1966)\, Second Fiddle to a Steel Guitar (1967)\, and Nashville Rebel (1967). Billboard named him the Number One Artist of 1969.   Even after James' number one streak ended in January 1972\, he continued to place high on the charts. The number two "Only Love Can Break a Heart" (a pop hit for Gene Pitney ten years earlier) was followed by the number ones "That's Why I Love You Like I Do" and -- after moving to Columbia in mid-1972 -- "When the Snow Is on the Roses." James' next chart-topping single\, "Is It Wrong (For Loving You)\," was released in March 1974\, and it began his last major run. He followed with four consecutive Top Ten hits\, "A Mi Esposa con Amor (To My Wife With Love)\," "A Little Bit South of Saskatoon\," "Little Band of Gold\," and "What in the World's Come Over You."   By the early '70s\, James had moved into producing and music publishing also; he oversaw three of Marie Osmond's albums and still managed occasional Top Tens himself. He picked up the prestigious award of Country Music's Male Artist of the Decade from Record World in 1977 and moved to the Monument label in 1979\, then to Dimension two years later. He retired in 1983\, and now raises cattle in Alabama.   ~ John Bush\, All Music Guide  PLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels\, Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

Vocals\, Bass - Spook Guitar - Kecks Sabopharge Drums - Vic 'Fontaine' Greener  Engineer - Kevin Ridley Producer - Kevin Ridley\, Spook And The Ghouls  Recorded at Impulse Studios\, Wallsend.  ------------------------  "Bela Lugosi's Dead" is a gothic rock song written by the band Bauhaus. The song was the band's first single\, released in August 1979\, and is often considered to be the first gothic rock record released. It did not enter the UK pop charts at that time. The b-side features the song "Boys" and some versions also include an early demo recording of what would be their next single\, "Dark Entries". It was released on CD in 1988 and was compiled on the 1998 album\, Crackle - The Best of Bauhaus. The original sleeve art was taken from a still of the film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.  Recording session  "Bela Lugosi's Dead" was recorded during a six-hour session at Beck Studios in Wellingborough on 26 January 1979. Four more songs were recorded ("Boys"\, "Harry"\, "Dark Entries" and the unreleased "Some Faces") but not used; only "Harry" surfaced in 1982 as a single B-side to "Kick In The Eye".  The song "Boys" was re-recorded at Beck Studios in spring 1979.  Use in film and television  The song was featured in the 1983 Tony Scott cult vampire film The Hunger\, with Bauhaus portraying a band in a nightclub\, playing it during the opening credits and introduction. A 7" promotional record featuring an edited version of the song was released to theaters playing the movie.  It was also played throughout the movie Dead Man's Curve/The Curve\, and featured in the French movie\, Sombre. The song is played in the movie Good Luck Chuck as an introduction for when the Goth girl is on screen and it is on the soundtrack.  The song was used as the intro music for the late 1990s Saturday Night Live skit "Goth Talk"\, which had Chris Kattan and Molly Shannon as two goth students. This song was also in an episode in the fifth season of Smallville\, the vampire/Halloween-themed "Thirst". The song was also in an episode of One Tree Hill.  The song was featured in an episode ("Midnight") of the science fiction/horror series Fringe which revolved around a vampire-esque creature.  Comedian and musician Bill Bailey parodied the song on his DVD Cosmic Jam as part of a medley in which he and his band\, the Stan Ellis Experiment performed Cockney Rock style versions of popular songs - this particular segment of the medley included lyrical changes such as "E ad a girl's name".  The song was played almost in its entirety during the horror film The Collector during a scene in which the older daughter was attempting to have sex with her boyfriend before they were both viciously murdered.  The song was played in the opening scene of the Supernatural television series in season 6\, episode 5\, "Live Free or Twi-Hard". The episode is vampire-themed\, poking particular fun at the Twilight movie series and its romanticism of vampires.  The Illuminoids made a mash-up called Lugosi's Mongoloid Loser with Bela Lugosi's Dead by Bauhaus\, Loser by Beck and Mongolid By Devo.  Ethan Gold also covered it. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

They are best known for their million-selling 1971 single "Put Your Hand in the Hand"\, penned by Gene MacLellan.[1] The gramophone record sold over one million copies and received a gold disc awarded by the Recording Industry Association of America on 3 May 1971.[1] Ocean consisted of Greg Brown (vocals\, keyboard)\, Jeff Jones (bass\, vocals)\, Janice Morgan (guitar\, vocals)\, Dave Tamblyn (guitar)\, and Chuck Slater (drums). The album was recorded in Toronto in 1970 and originally released on the highly collectable Yorkville label in Canada. The album contained eight songs written by such notables as Robbie Robertson and Gene MacLellan. The album was picked up in the U.S. by the Kama Sutra label that also released the band's second album in both the U.S. and Canada. Ocean managed another hit in Canada with the song "I've Got a Dream" written by the British songwriting team of Cook and Greenway\, but they failed to make any impact in the U.S. and disbanded in 1975 after only two albums.

COL title VAL Wedding Bells (Are Breaking Up That Old Gang of Mine) COL performer VAL Gene Vincent and His Blue Caps	COL video title VAL Gene Austin - Wedding Bells Are Breaking Up That Old Gang Of Mine 1929 COL description VAL Victor 21893 - This Song Peaked On US Music Charts At #8 In 1929 Gene Austin (June 24\, 1900 -- January 24\, 1972) was an American singer and songwriter\, one of the first "crooners". His 1920s compositions "When My Sugar Walks Down the Street" and "The Lonesome Road" became pop and jazz standards. Austin was born as Lemeul Eugene Lucas in Gainesville\, Texas (north of Dallas)\, to Nova Lucas (died 1943) and the former Serena Belle Harrell (died 1956). He took the name "Gene Austin" from his stepfather\, Jim Austin\, a blacksmith. Austin grew up in Minden\, the seat of Webster Parish in northwestern Louisiana\, located east of Shreveport. There he learned to play piano and guitar. He ran away from home at 15 and attended a vaudeville act in Houston\, Texas\, where the audience was allowed to come to the stage and sing. On a dare from his friends\, Austin took the stage and sang for the first time since singing as a Southern Baptist choir boy. The audience response was overwhelming\, and the vaudeville company immediately offered him a billed spot on their ticket. Austin joined the U.S. Army at the age of 17 in hopes of being dispatched to Europe to fight in World War I. He was first stationed in New Orleans\, where he played the piano at night in the city's notorious vice district. His familiarity with horses from helping his stepfather in his blacksmithing business also prompted the Army to assign Austin to the cavalry and send him to Mexico with General John Pershing's Pancho Villa expedition\, for which he was awarded the Mexican Service Medal. Thereafter\, he served in France in the Great War. On returning to the United States in 1919\, Austin settled in Baltimore\, Maryland\, where he intended to study dentistry. Soon\, however\, he was playing piano and singing in local taverns. He started writing songs and formed a vaudeville act with Roy Bergere\, with whom he wrote "How Come You Do Me Like You Do." The act ended when Bergere married. Austin worked briefly in a club owned by Lou Clayton\, who later was a part of the famous vaudeville team Clayton\, Jackson and Durante. Gene Austin was an important pioneer crooner whose records in their day enjoyed record sales and the highest circulation. The Genial Texan ex-vaudevillian and would-be screen idol\, Austin constitutes an underrated landmark in popular music history. He made a substantial number of influential recordings from the mid-1920s including a string of best-sellers. In 1956\, CBS made a television drama about Austin's life. In 1962\, Austin campaigned unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for governor of Nevada. He polled only 5\,017 votes (10.21 percent) to his opponent\, Grant Sawyer\, who received 40\,168 ballots (81.4 percent) Sawyer then won the governorship by a nearly 2-1 margin over weak Republican opposition in the fall campaign. Austin had retired to Palm Springs\, in the late 1950s and had been active in civic boards there until 1970. Income from his record sales allowed him to live comfortably the rest of his life. He died in Palm Springs of lung cancer and was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale\, California. He was a godfather of country singer David Houston\, who like Austin also lived in Minden\, Louisiana\, during his youth. "Wedding Bells Are Breaking Up (That Old Gang Of Mine)" is a popular barbershop song\, also known as just "That Old Gang Of Mine". The song laments the loss of childhood friendships when growing up into adulthood. The music was written by Sammy Fain and the lyrics by Irving Kahal and Willie Raskin. The song was published in 1929. COL channel name VAL warholsoup100	1

COL title VAL This Strange Effect COL performer VAL The Kinks	COL video title VAL Daliah Lavi - Das bleibt immer ein Geheimnis COL description VAL Daliah Lavis kongeniale deutsche Version von Gérard Lenormans "La ballade des gens heureux" aus dem Jahr 1976.  Warum der alte Stern\, die gute Erde\, sich ewig drehen muss durchs Himmelsblau  ja das bleibt immer ein Geheimnis\, das weiß niemand so ganz genau.  Warum spricht der alte Mann in seinem Garten zu den Blumen wie mit seiner Frau? Ja das bleibt immer ein Geheimnis\, das weiß niemand so ganz genau. Ja das bleibt immer ein Geheimnis\, das weiß niemand so ganz genau.  Warum tun wir\, wenn wir von Liebe reden\, als gäbs nur Liebe zwischen Mann und Frau? Ja das bleibt immer ein Geheimnis\, das weiß niemand so ganz genau. Ja das bleibt immer ein Geheimnis\, das weiß niemand so ganz genau.  Warum wir Menschen nie in Frieden leben können\, ohne Mauer\, Grenzen\, Drahtverhau - ja das bleibt immer ein Geheimnis\, das weiß niemand so ganz genau. Ja das bleibt immer ein Geheimnis\, das weiß niemand so ganz genau.  Warum ist Töten und ist Töten nicht dasselbe? In Uniform stellt man es noch zur Schau! Ja das bleibt immer ein Geheimnis\, das weiß niemand so ganz genau. Ja das bleibt immer ein Geheimnis\, das weiß niemand so ganz genau.  Wir alle suchen jeden Tag die Wahrheit. Sind wir\, wenn wir sie finden\, alt und grau? Ja das bleibt immer ein Geheimnis\, das weiß niemand so ganz genau. Ja das bleibt immer ein Geheimnis\, das weiß niemand so ganz genau.

COL title VAL The Stripper COL performer VAL Bobby Crush	COL video title VAL Joanie Sommers – “Step Inside Love” (Happy Tiger) 1968 COL description VAL Written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Arranged by  Capps and produced by Joseph Porter.  Joanie\, who scored a #7 US hit with “Johnny Get Angry” in the summer of 1962\, didn’t return to Hot-100 after “When The Boys Get Together” charted in October of the same year.  Some great records followed on Warners\, however\, including the northern soul favorite\, “Don’t Pity Me” in 1965. By 1967\, Joanie was with Columbia and following year with Capitol but still the hits continued to elude her – notwithstanding the quality of her recordings.  “Step Inside Love” had been a #8 UK hit for Cilla Black during Cilla’s ten year chart run from the early 60s.  The Happy Tiger label was owned by the Flying Tiger Line\, an air freight company. The label ran from 1968-71 and was home to artists such as Donnie Brooks\, Priscilla Paris and Them.

I lay there in the sun And felt it caressing my face As I fell asleep And dreamed. I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie And that I was the star of the movie. This really blew my mind\, The fact that me\, An overfed\, long-haired\, leaping gnome\, Should be the star of a Hollywood movie. Hmm\, but there I was. I was taken to a place\, The hall of the mountain king. I stood high upon a mountain top\, Naked to the world\, In front of every kind of girl. There was long ones\, tall ones\, short ones\, brown ones\, Black ones\, round ones\, big ones\, crazy ones. Out of the middle Came a lady. She whispered in my ear Something crazy. She said\, Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl." I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back As she disappeared\, But soon she returned. In her hand was a bottle of wine\, In the other\, a glass.

Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl." Take that pearl\, yeah. It's on girl\, all you gotta do is spill that wine\, spill that wine. Let me feel\, let me feel fine\, yeah\, yeah. Spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, take that pearl.

It was the 3rd track on her 2001 CD Single\, released in Australia by rooArt Records\, cat. # 74321848392. The other two tracks\, "Sleep" and "All I Want" were also on her album "The Other Side"\, but this track was an orphan...to my knowledge\, this single is the only place it was ever issued.  It is a gentle\, acoustic-pop remake of the Badfinger classic.  Prior to this release\, Shanley was considered a country artist\, but\, this album had much more of a Pop flavour\, which I guess accounts for the album title\, "The Other Side". As part of the new image\, she also dropped the 'Del" from her name...on this release\, she is simply called "Shanley".  *** If you like my channel\, why not SUBSCRIBE?

In the prison cell I sit\, Thinking Mother dear of you\, And our bright and happy home so far away\, And the tears they fill my eyes Spite of all that I can do Though I try to cheer my comrades and be gay.  Chorus: Tramp! tramp! tramp! The boys are marching Cheer up comrades\, They will come. And beneath the starry flag We shall breathe the air again Of the free land in our own beloved home.  In the battle front we stood When their fiercest charge they made\, And they swept us off a hundred men or more; But before we reached their lines They were beaten back\, dismayed\, And we heard the cry of vict'ry o'er and o'er.  So within the prison cell We are waiting for the day That shall come to open wide the iron door; And the hollow eye grows bright And the poor heart almost gay As we think of seing home and friends once more.

COL title VAL Pouring Water on a Drowning Man COL performer VAL James Carr	COL video title VAL Harpers Bizarre - Witchi Tai To COL description VAL Harpers Bizarre 4 is an album by Harpers Bizarre (Warner Bros. 1969) Ry Cooder contributes on slide guitar.  the song "Witchi Tai To" by jazzman Jim Pepper was given the group's smooth harmony veneer and mock-rococo production.  Pepper\,  was of Native American descent\, from the Plains tribes of the Kaw and the Cree. He came from a family of "road men"\, the peyote priests of the Native American Church. He was also a jazz saxophonist\, playing primarily tenor sax (but also soprano sax and flute).  encouraged by friends Ornette Coleman and Don Cherry\, Pepper began experimenting with mixing Native American music and jazz\, with interesting results. "Witchi Tai To" is a prime example of that blending\, taking a peyote song he'd learned from his grandfather and putting it in a jazz setting. COL channel name VAL mojavemoog	0

COL title VAL Police & Thieves COL performer VAL Zara McFarlane	COL video title VAL Eddy Arnold -- Seven Years With The Wrong Woman (VintageMusic.es) COL description VAL Eddy Arnold\, nacido el 15 de mayo de 1918 en la localidad de Henderson\, condado de Chester\, Tennessee y fallecido el 8 de mayo de 2008 en Franklin\, condado de Williamson\, Tennessee debido a una enfermedad\, fue un músico estadounidense\, especialmente volcado a la música country\, cuyo verdadero nombre era Richard Edward Arnold. Entre su debut en el mundo de la música en 1945 y 1954\, Eddie logró 58 top ten consecutivos\, y nunca marcó menos de un top 40 durante sus 21 años de carrera\, con más de 140 discos diferentes de los cuales se vendieron más de 85 millones de copias\, incluidos eternos clásicos como Bouquet de Rosas o Anytime. Recibió el apodo de Tennessee Plowboy (el chico del arado de Tennessee en inglés)\, y firmó contratos con las compañías discográficas RCA Records y MGM Records.  Richard Edward Arnold nació en Henderson\, en el condado de Chester\, estado de Tennessee\, el 15 de mayo de 1918 y se educó en el medio rural. Su padre era un violinista que alentó a su hijo respecto del desarrollo de sus talentos musicales y logró reunir el dinero suficiente para comprar a su niño una guitarra a la edad de 10 años. Para cuando entró en la escuela secundaria Eddie Arnols ya era toda una estrella local\, pero con la llegada de la Gran Depresión en 1929 y la crisis económica de los años 1930\, Eddy tuvo que dejar la escuela para ayudar trabajar como asistente en una funeraria. Relegó sus actuaciones musicales a funciones locales\, aunque de vez en cuando viajaba montado en una mula con su guitarra a la espalda.  Al igual que otros artistas del country de la época\, Eddy consiguió su pase al estrellato con sus apariciones en vivo por la radio\, antes de debutar en Jackson\, en Tennessee\, en 1936 y posteriormente en San Luis\, en el estado de Misuri.  Entre 1940 y 1943 apareció en el Grand Ole Opry junto a Pee Wee King. Apodado como el chico del arado de Tennessee (o Tennessee Plowboy\, en inglés) firmó con la RCA Victor Records un contrato en 1944 con ese nombre\, que fue el que apareció en sus discos hasta 1954. Con el tema Every hour Seems A Million Years alcanzó el quinto disco de su carrera\, dando con dicho disco comienzo a la cadena de 58 consecutivos éxitos top ten. En 1947 Arnold logró sus tres primeros éxitos número uno\, siendo uno de ellos número uno durante 21 semanas. Eddy Arnold realizó temas universalmente populares convirtiéndose en una estrella perenne\, grabando discos durante un período de cinco décadas\, desde los años 1960 hasta los años 1980; tras una pausa de siete años incluso regresó al estudio en 1990.  Además de establecer un nivel inigualable dada su avanzada edad\, Arnold se convirtió en un ejemplo de cómo manejar su fortuna en el mundo del espectáculo.

COL title VAL Gentleman Friend COL performer VAL The George Shearing Quintet with Nancy Wilson	COL video title VAL Joan of Arc (Leonard Cohen) - Allison Crowe w. lyrics COL description VAL On her debut album "secrets" Allison Crowe covers this Leonard Cohen song. Her voice and piano is accompanied by Jo Lundstrom (Rosehip Jam\, Black Velvet Band) on accordion. Crowe engineered the recording\, with production by Rainer Willeke (of Victoria\, B.C.'s Raindog Studios).  http://music.allisoncrowe.com/track/joan-of-arc  The photo of Allison Crowe is by Billie Woods.  MOJO magazine's December '08 issue paid tribute to "Rock's Greatest Poet" Leonard Cohen with a celebration of his "deep and moving music". Of Allison Crowe's contribution of "Joan of Arc" to its 'All Star Tribute"\, (featuring Judy Collins\, Nick Cave\, Katie Melua\, Martha Wainwright\, Dion and others)\, a cover-mount CD titled "Cohen Covered"\, MOJO says: "Once famously described by the Vancouver Courier as possessing a style akin to 'Elton John meets Edith Piaf'\, the Canadian singer-songwriter Allison Crowe is renowned for her ability to blend control and melodrama. Certainly she does so on this spirited cover of Cohen's 'Songs of Love and Hate' classic\, a track which also powerfully showcases her considerable talent as a fine interpreter of song."  "Any album that features a track from Leonard Cohen is certainly heading in the right direction. But when it is covered so beautifully\, it makes you realise what an amazing lyricist Leonard Cohen is. Joan of Arc is the Cohen song covered on this album and it's certainly in my top 10 of Cohen covers. It's also my favorite track on (Secrets)" ~ Colin Meeks\, indielaunchpad.com (USA)  Joan of Arc  Words & Music by Leonard Cohen As performed by Allison Crowe  Now the flames they followed Joan of Arc as she came riding through the dark; no moon to keep her armour bright\, no man to get her through this dark and smoky night.   She said\, "I'm tired of the war\, I want the kind of work I had before\, A wedding dress or something white to wear upon my swollen appetite."  Well\, I'm glad to hear you talk this way\, I've watched you riding every day and there is something in me that yearns to win such a cold\, such a lonesome heroine.  "And who are you?" she sternly spoke to the one beneath the smoke. "Why\, I'm fire\," he replied\, "And I love your solitude\, I love your pride."  "Well\, then\, fire make your body cold\, I'm going to give you mine to hold." And saying this she climbed inside to be his one\, to be his only bride.  Then deep into his fiery heart he took the dust of Joan of Arc\, and high above all these wedding guests he hung the ashes of her lovely wedding dress.  It was deep into his fiery heart he took the dust of Joan of Arc\, and then she clearly understood if he was fire\, oh\, she must be wood.  I saw her wince\, I saw her cry\, I saw the glory in her eye. Myself I long for love and light\, but must it come so cruel\,  must it be so bright? COL channel name VAL Allison Crowe	0

Warum der alte Stern\, die gute Erde\, sich ewig drehen muss durchs Himmelsblau  ja das bleibt immer ein Geheimnis\, das weiß niemand so ganz genau.  Warum spricht der alte Mann in seinem Garten zu den Blumen wie mit seiner Frau? Ja das bleibt immer ein Geheimnis\, das weiß niemand so ganz genau. Ja das bleibt immer ein Geheimnis\, das weiß niemand so ganz genau.  Warum tun wir\, wenn wir von Liebe reden\, als gäbs nur Liebe zwischen Mann und Frau? Ja das bleibt immer ein Geheimnis\, das weiß niemand so ganz genau. Ja das bleibt immer ein Geheimnis\, das weiß niemand so ganz genau.  Warum wir Menschen nie in Frieden leben können\, ohne Mauer\, Grenzen\, Drahtverhau - ja das bleibt immer ein Geheimnis\, das weiß niemand so ganz genau. Ja das bleibt immer ein Geheimnis\, das weiß niemand so ganz genau.  Warum ist Töten und ist Töten nicht dasselbe? In Uniform stellt man es noch zur Schau! Ja das bleibt immer ein Geheimnis\, das weiß niemand so ganz genau. Ja das bleibt immer ein Geheimnis\, das weiß niemand so ganz genau.  Wir alle suchen jeden Tag die Wahrheit. Sind wir\, wenn wir sie finden\, alt und grau? Ja das bleibt immer ein Geheimnis\, das weiß niemand so ganz genau. Ja das bleibt immer ein Geheimnis\, das weiß niemand so ganz genau.

COL title VAL Les bourgeois COL performer VAL Jacques Brel	COL video title VAL Uriah Heep - Lady in Black COL description VAL http://www.discogs.com/artist/Uriah+Heep http://www.myspace.com/uriaheep  Uriah Heep's by-the-books progressive heavy metal made the British band one of the most popular hard rock groups of the early '70s. Formed by vocalist David Byron and guitarist Mick Box in the late '60s\, the group went through an astonishing number of members over the next two decades — nearly 30 different musicians passed through the band over the years. Byron and Box were members of the mid-'60s rock band called the Stalkers; once that band broke up\, the duo formed another group called Spice. Spice would eventually turn into Uriah Heep in the late '60s\, once Ken Hensley (guitar\, keyboards\, vocals) and bassist Paul Newton joined the pair. Former Spice drummer Alex Napier was the band's drummer for a brief time; he was quickly replaced by Nigel Olsson. Uriah Heep released their debut album Very 'eavy...Very 'umble (called Uriah Heep in the U.S.) in 1970. After its release\, Keith Baker became the group's drummer; he recorded Salisbury\, the group's second album\, before deciding he couldn't keep up with the band's extensive touring and was replaced by Ian Clarke. Salisbury\, featuring a 16-minute title track recorded with a 26-piece orchestra\, showcased the band's more progressive tendencies. Later that year\, Ian Clarke was replaced by Lee Kerslake and Mark Clarke replaced Newton; Mark Clarke quickly left the band and Gary Thain became the group's bassist. This lineup of Uriah Heep was its most stable and popular; beginning with 1972's Demons and Wizards\, they released five albums between 1972 and 1975. After 1975\, the band's popularity began to slip. Byron left the band in 1977 and was replaced by John Lawton\, yet the group's fortunes kept declining right into the early '80s. However\, Uriah Heep soldiered on\, continuing to release albums into the '90s and 2000s. The album roster included Different World (1994)\, Sea of Light (1995)\, Sonic Origami (1998)\, and Spellbinder (1999). COL channel name VAL TheDeZyx	0

Growing up in an artistic\, politically engaged family in the Bronx\, he became an early rock 'n' roll convert after attending an Alan Freed rock 'n' roll revue that included performances by Chuck Berry\, Buddy Holly\, Jerry Lee Lewis\, Little Richard and Frankie Lymon.  His thirst for new and old sounds drove him to exploring blues\, soul\, country\, folk and jazz\, inspiring weekly visits to Harlem's Apollo Theatre and leading to acquaintances with many of the music's surviving originators.   Wolf's talent as a painter won him a grant to study at the Boston Museum School of Fine Arts.  While a student there\, he experienced a life-changing epiphany after jumping on stage to sing with a blues band at a loft party.  He soon talked himself into membership in that band\, The Hallucinations.   "I didn't join a band to meet girls\," Wolf recalls.  "I joined my first band to meet musicians.  Painting was a fascination for me\, but I was a music fanatic\, and sitting in with that band was a born-again type of experience for me.  I was transfixed\, and myself and some of the guys in the band would check out performances by the musicians we admired so much\, like Muddy Waters and John Lee Hooker and John Coltrane and Bill Monroe and the Stanley Brothers.  Those roots stayed with me." COL channel name VAL Concord Records	1

COL title VAL Pour Some Sugar on Me COL performer VAL Richard Cheese	COL video title VAL 'With my eyes wide open I'm dreaming'--Patti Page 'Quartet' (1949) COL description VAL Recorded in November 1949\, this is a classic example of 'multiple' recording\, as opposed to multitrack recording.  At the time this record was made there were no multitrack tape recorders.  In fact\, the studio this was recorded at (most likely Reeves in New York City) had yet to acquire tape equipment; hence\, this recording was made by first recording part of the music on one lacquer disc\, then playing this disc back through a mixer while another part was played or sung live along with the playback\, the mix of these parts being then recorded onto a second lacquer disc.  This was done four times (original recording plus three overdubs) to produce the four vocal parts heard on this record.   Les Paul was the first to produce successful 'multiples' (as he called them)\, both technically and artistically\, and what his label Capitol nicknamed 'The New Sound' spawned a brief fad where other performers tried to mimic his recording technique on their records\, with varying degrees of success.  This record was one of the better ones\, and Patti Page had several hits with this type of sound. COL channel name VAL PerisphereRec	0

Входит в список "100 лучших гитаристов мира" по версии журнала Classic Rock. Сценический псевдоним "Рэнди Калифорния" дал ему (в 15 лет) Джими Хендрикс\, чтобы можно было отличить от другого Рэнди в тогдашней группе Хендрикса Jimmy James and the Blue Flames (второго Рэнди Хендрикс называл "Рэнди Техас"). После ухода из группы Spirit (июль 1971) Рэнди начал сольную карьеру\, подписал контракт с Epic и выпустил осенью 1972 года альбом Kapt. Kopter and the (Fabulous) Twirly Birds. Музыка - Хендриксо-подобная\, с импровизациями\, кроме того здесь на некоторых треках играет басист Noel Redding (ex-Jimi Hendrix Experience). Следует отметить\, что на этой пластинке некоторые известные музыканты записаны под псевдонимами. С Эдом Кэссиди (своим отчимом) и басистом Ларри Найтом (Larry «Fuzzy» Knight) он провёл в Европе гастроли в поддержку своей пластинки. Но не совсем удачные\, так как Калифорния оказался неважным промоутером... Трио\, кроме того\, подготовило концептуальный альбом Potatoland\, но лейбл его отверг и Калифорния на некоторое время ушёл из музыкального бизнеса\, поселившись на Гавайях.

COL title VAL In My Way COL performer VAL Preslisa	COL video title VAL Bob Wills - Home In San Antone -HD copy now available. Link below COL description VAL https://youtu.be/gVrCs58PNUU This is a much better HD copy of the music\, plus Stay a Little Longer.  Westenr Swing music from the 1940s.  This has Noel Boggs on Steel\, which means after the war probably 1946. Alex Beshear on trumpet plays it without a mute.  That was quite unusual for him.  Also Tommy sings it.  When Bob made the Okey 78\, the vocalist was Danny Alguire\, who also played trumpet.  Tommy had joined the army when that session took play. So here we get to hear the way he would have done it.  Just wish the quality was better.  Notice the accordian?  Bob never used one in his recordings\, and I have to wonder where Noel plugged in his steel guitar.  Behind a tree?  Hot session\, though.

Wayne wrote several hits for The Box Tops\, as well as a string of hits for major country artists...and\, he co-wrote the CMA\, ACM and Grammy Award winning classic\, "Always On My Mind". Little wonder that he is a member of the Nashville Songwriters Hall Of Fame.  This track was released in Australia in 1969 as the flipside of a Monument 45\, PK3132. The A. side was Wayne's own version of the Waylon hit "(Don't Let The Sun Set On You In) Tulsa"\, which I've also uploaded to YouTube.  This upload is from the original 45.  *** If you like my channel\, why not SUBSCRIBE?

In questa puntata (la seconda delle tre) propose "Il volto della vita"\, lanciato in Italia da Caterina Caselli ma già noto negli States col titolo "The Days Of Pearly Spencer". Il brano in questione è contenuto col nuovo titolo de "La sirena di Ipanema" nell'album "Vietato ai minori" terzo capitolo della trilogia cover realizzata da Ivan nell'81 (Duemila60 Italian Graffiati)\, nell'83 (Bandiera gialla) e nell'86 appunto con "Vietato ai minori".   Il Volto Della Vita  Con il corpo sono qui ma la mente mia non c'è\, corre dietro a dei ricordi e chi la ferma più. I miei occhi sono chiusi\, ma ci vedo molto bene\, son davanti ad una casa\, entro e vedo te...  Il volto della vita... Il volto dell'amore.  Rose rosse alle pareti\, giochi d'ombra sul tuo viso\, come rami le mie braccia si apron verso te. Ed ancora la mia mente non è stanca di vagare e mi porta lungo un fiume e in fondo vedo te.  Il volto della vita... Il volto dell'amore...  Sei vestito un poco strano ma d'altronde\, come sempre\, il mio cuore ti fa festa\, sono a un passo da te. Ma qualcuno ha bussato e il mio viaggio è terminato\, io mi alzo per aprire\, apro e vedo te...  Il volto della vita... Il volto dell'amore... Il volto della vita...

COL title VAL Wasted COL performer VAL Pinback	COL video title VAL Eddy Arnold -- Seven Years With The Wrong Woman (VintageMusic.es) COL description VAL Eddy Arnold\, nacido el 15 de mayo de 1918 en la localidad de Henderson\, condado de Chester\, Tennessee y fallecido el 8 de mayo de 2008 en Franklin\, condado de Williamson\, Tennessee debido a una enfermedad\, fue un músico estadounidense\, especialmente volcado a la música country\, cuyo verdadero nombre era Richard Edward Arnold. Entre su debut en el mundo de la música en 1945 y 1954\, Eddie logró 58 top ten consecutivos\, y nunca marcó menos de un top 40 durante sus 21 años de carrera\, con más de 140 discos diferentes de los cuales se vendieron más de 85 millones de copias\, incluidos eternos clásicos como Bouquet de Rosas o Anytime. Recibió el apodo de Tennessee Plowboy (el chico del arado de Tennessee en inglés)\, y firmó contratos con las compañías discográficas RCA Records y MGM Records.  Richard Edward Arnold nació en Henderson\, en el condado de Chester\, estado de Tennessee\, el 15 de mayo de 1918 y se educó en el medio rural. Su padre era un violinista que alentó a su hijo respecto del desarrollo de sus talentos musicales y logró reunir el dinero suficiente para comprar a su niño una guitarra a la edad de 10 años. Para cuando entró en la escuela secundaria Eddie Arnols ya era toda una estrella local\, pero con la llegada de la Gran Depresión en 1929 y la crisis económica de los años 1930\, Eddy tuvo que dejar la escuela para ayudar trabajar como asistente en una funeraria. Relegó sus actuaciones musicales a funciones locales\, aunque de vez en cuando viajaba montado en una mula con su guitarra a la espalda.  Al igual que otros artistas del country de la época\, Eddy consiguió su pase al estrellato con sus apariciones en vivo por la radio\, antes de debutar en Jackson\, en Tennessee\, en 1936 y posteriormente en San Luis\, en el estado de Misuri.  Entre 1940 y 1943 apareció en el Grand Ole Opry junto a Pee Wee King. Apodado como el chico del arado de Tennessee (o Tennessee Plowboy\, en inglés) firmó con la RCA Victor Records un contrato en 1944 con ese nombre\, que fue el que apareció en sus discos hasta 1954. Con el tema Every hour Seems A Million Years alcanzó el quinto disco de su carrera\, dando con dicho disco comienzo a la cadena de 58 consecutivos éxitos top ten. En 1947 Arnold logró sus tres primeros éxitos número uno\, siendo uno de ellos número uno durante 21 semanas. Eddy Arnold realizó temas universalmente populares convirtiéndose en una estrella perenne\, grabando discos durante un período de cinco décadas\, desde los años 1960 hasta los años 1980; tras una pausa de siete años incluso regresó al estudio en 1990.  Además de establecer un nivel inigualable dada su avanzada edad\, Arnold se convirtió en un ejemplo de cómo manejar su fortuna en el mundo del espectáculo. "Guardo mi primer dólar y sigo ahorrando e invirtiendo mi dinero"\, recuerda\, "nunca olvidé cómo se sentía ser pobre"\, añadió. Eddie Anold se convirtió en uno de los hombres más ricos de la industria mediante la inversión en la única cosa que él consideraba de valor de propiedad\, "la tierra". Debido a su enorme popularidad musical Eddy Arnold se convirtió en un auténtico embajador de la música country a nivel mundial   Spotify:http://open.spotify.com/album/4tQOsxLgCwxPCRNS5LeWxN iTunes:http://itunes.apple.com/es/album/vintage-country-no-11-ep-all/id374306958 Síguenos en: Spotify: https://goo.gl/raouHQ Facebook: https://goo.gl/L92BHL Instagram: https://goo.gl/3oYDGH Web: http://www.vintagemusic.es   Compra nuestros Cd's en formato físico en estas plataformas: Ebay:  http://stores.ebay.com/VintageMusicFm BoutiqAlia: www.boutiqalia-vintagemusic.com Discogs: https://www.discogs.com/es/seller/vintagemusicfm/profile COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm	0

Alfonzo was a great singer\, with some good songs\, but to my opinion\, they should have launched him as an artist in his own right and not just a copycat of Michal Jackson. This last fact was surely true for his looks. Sadly enough he faded away from the scene\, maybe a wrong choice of managment or something like that. He was a great singer! This song is an absolutely favourite of mine! Anyone knows what happend to him? COL channel name VAL peterpiessens	0

COL title VAL Cherry Bomb COL performer VAL Joan Jett and The Blackhearts	COL video title VAL Elly Lapp - Ich weiß es wird einmal ein Wunder gescheh'n COL description VAL Elly Lapp Ganz nah  Genre: Deutsch-Pop\, Chanson\, Schlager   „Eine Stimme die unter die Haut geht.  Eindringlich\, lasziv\, ganz nah."   Elly Lapp liebt die Brückenschläge. Für sie sind UFA-Schlager und Popmusik keine  unarrangierbaren Gegensätze\, sondern interpretatorische Herausforderung. Dabei ist eine sehr moderne CD entstanden\,  die gleichzeitig sehr intensiv und sehr persönlich ist. Viel näher geht`s nicht.   Es waren große Songs -- es sind große Songs. Dazu leistet eine interessante Interpretin ihren Beitrag. Elly Lapp. Die studierte Schauspielerin und Sängerin tourt mit eigenen Programmen durch Deutschland -- und sie war die Stimme des Titelsongs der erfolgreichen ARD-Fernsehserie „Kir Royal".  „Der Wind hat mir ein Lied erzählt" - gleichzeitig erste Single - und „Ich steh` im Regen" sind Versuche einer ungewöhnlichen Verbindung von UFA - HIT und POPSOUND. Zarah Leander machte einst diese Songs zu Welterfolgen. Damals hatten die Autoren wohl nie eine Umsetzung mit rockigen Gitarren oder Saxophon im Auge. Hier geben die modernen Instrumente\, wie das gesamte Pop- Arrangement\, eine ganz neue Farbe -- voller Intensität.  Doch die CD von Elly Lapp zeigt die großen Filmhits nicht nur im Popgewand\, sondern auch sehr sparsam\, kunstvoll arrangiert\, als Chansons mit großer interpretatorischer Tiefe.  z.B."

Virtually every major session player in Nashville was a member of The Radio Playboys at one time or another. Infact\, the great Grady Martin started out playing fiddle for Big Jeff in the early days. But most importantly\, Big Jeff recorded some of the most rockingest\, swinginest toe tappin' music ever to come out of Tennessee. It's records like this that helped pave the way for rock'n'roll.

COL title VAL Get the Party Started COL performer VAL Crew 7	COL video title VAL Elly Lapp - Ich weiß es wird einmal ein Wunder gescheh'n COL description VAL Elly Lapp Ganz nah  Genre: Deutsch-Pop\, Chanson\, Schlager   „Eine Stimme die unter die Haut geht.  Eindringlich\, lasziv\, ganz nah."   Elly Lapp liebt die Brückenschläge. Für sie sind UFA-Schlager und Popmusik keine  unarrangierbaren Gegensätze\, sondern interpretatorische Herausforderung. Dabei ist eine sehr moderne CD entstanden\,  die gleichzeitig sehr intensiv und sehr persönlich ist. Viel näher geht`s nicht.   Es waren große Songs -- es sind große Songs. Dazu leistet eine interessante Interpretin ihren Beitrag. Elly Lapp. Die studierte Schauspielerin und Sängerin tourt mit eigenen Programmen durch Deutschland -- und sie war die Stimme des Titelsongs der erfolgreichen ARD-Fernsehserie „Kir Royal".  „Der Wind hat mir ein Lied erzählt" - gleichzeitig erste Single - und „Ich steh` im Regen" sind Versuche einer ungewöhnlichen Verbindung von UFA - HIT und POPSOUND. Zarah Leander machte einst diese Songs zu Welterfolgen. Damals hatten die Autoren wohl nie eine Umsetzung mit rockigen Gitarren oder Saxophon im Auge. Hier geben die modernen Instrumente\, wie das gesamte Pop- Arrangement\, eine ganz neue Farbe -- voller Intensität.  Doch die CD von Elly Lapp zeigt die großen Filmhits nicht nur im Popgewand\, sondern auch sehr sparsam\, kunstvoll arrangiert\, als Chansons mit großer interpretatorischer Tiefe.  z.B." Wenn ich mir was wünschen dürfte" und - vor allem - „Der Nowack lässt mich nicht verkommen" -\, ein wahrer Kultsong\, 1959 geschrieben\, sofort auf Schallplatte aufgenommen\, kurzerhand von einem Münchner Gericht verboten und wieder eingestampft -- eine echte Rarität für jedes Rundfunk- und Privatarchiv!

The original line-up consisted of Brian le Gassick – lead vocals\, guitar\, John Leach – lead guitar\, Willie van der Walt – bass and Ian Miller – drums. In 1962 Leach and van der Walt were replaced by Richard Crouse – guitar\, Jimmy Routledge – bass and Billy Andrews – vocals\, harmonica (Billy later became one half of the duo the “Dream Merchants” with Billy Forrest). In 1964 the Staccatos won the Transvaal Merseyside Contest\, which included a recording contract with EMI. They supported Peter and Gordon on their tour of South Africa in 1965.  In 1966 Steve Lonsdale took over the lead vocals\, and Richard Crouse married Wanda Arletti who joined the group for a tour of Zambia. In 1967 Eddie Boyle – bass\, and Ronnie Cline – organ\, joined the group. In 1968 Billy Forrest approached the group to record “Cry to me” for the film “Katrina”.

In 1969 John Elliot – sax\, joined the group and in 1970 Ivor Black – drums and Peter Vee – lead vocals (Steve Lonsdale left for America).

COL title VAL Handy Man COL performer VAL Del Shannon	COL video title VAL The Easy Riders -- South Coast COL description VAL The Easy Riders were an American folk music band\, that operated from 1956 to 1959\, consisting of Terry Gilkyson\, Richard Dehr\, and Frank Miller. Their career was guided by Mitch Miller\, who had them under contract for Columbia Records. Their greatest hit\, in early 1957\, was the song "Marianne". The group also composed some tunes for the 1958 cinemiracle-documentaryWindjammer\, such as "Kari Waits for Me" and "Sugar Cane". One of Gilkyson's songs was a number one hit for Frankie Laine\, "The Cry of the Wild Goose". Gilkyson wrote many tunes for Laine\, and he and The Easy Riders were also featured on Frankie's 1957 hit\, "Love Is a Golden Ring"\, having also penned the number for Laine.  Many songs of the group became better known through the interpretation of other singers\, such as the Kingston Trio\, Gale Storm\, Harry Belafonte\, Doris Day\, Burl Ives and the The Brothers Four. Their song "Memories Are Made of This" became a top hit through the interpretation by Dean Martin. After the Easy Riders made a single with the 1927 song "Tell The Captain"\, the Beach Boys adapted it and made of it their hit "Sloop John B". Gilkyson left the group in the early 1960s to work for Disney studios and wrote the Oscar-nominated "The Bear Necessities" for Disney's The Jungle Book.

Since you been gone\, since you been gone. I'm out of my head can't take it. Could I be wrong\, but since you ben gone. You cast a spell so break it.  So in the night I stand\, beneath the back street light. I read the words that you sent to me. I can take the afternoon but night time comes around too soon. You can't know what you mean to me. Your poison letter\, your telegram. They go to show you don't give a damn.  Since you been gone\, since you been gone. I'm out of my head can't take it. Could I be wrong\, but since you ben gone.

COL title VAL 7 Years COL performer VAL Travis Atreo	COL video title VAL Shanley Del - Day After Day (Non-LP Track) COL description VAL Here's a much-sought-after Non-LP track from New Zealand/Aussie artist\, Shanley Del.  It was the 3rd track on her 2001 CD Single\, released in Australia by rooArt Records\, cat. # 74321848392. The other two tracks\, "Sleep" and "All I Want" were also on her album "The Other Side"\, but this track was an orphan...to my knowledge\, this single is the only place it was ever issued.  It is a gentle\, acoustic-pop remake of the Badfinger classic.  Prior to this release\, Shanley was considered a country artist\, but\, this album had much more of a Pop flavour\, which I guess accounts for the album title\, "The Other Side". As part of the new image\, she also dropped the 'Del" from her name...on this release\, she is simply called "Shanley".  *** If you like my channel\, why not SUBSCRIBE?

COL title VAL Nocturne COL performer VAL Døsty Cåwshit	COL video title VAL Sonny James - Endlessly (The Johnny Cash Show - Jan 27\, 1971) COL description VAL Sonny James\, the Southern Gentleman\, used the popular Nashville sound of the '60s to countrify pop hits of the past into a form accessible to many\, broadening country music's appeal across the nation. James even moved over to the pop charts for a time in the late '50s but found the secret of his success by the time he returned to country. During the late '60s\, he scored an incredible five-year run of number one singles which locked up the top spot for a combined 45 weeks during the late '60s.   Born James Loden on May 1\, 1929\, he began performing with his show-business family at the age of three and played with his four sisters as the Loden Family while in his teens. The group appeared around the South and on radio shows like the Louisiana Hayride and Saturday Night Shindig. After spending time overseas during the Korean War\, Loden took Sonny James as his stage name -- after his teenage nickname -- and joined the local bar circuit. He met and played with Chet Atkins\, who later got him a tryout with Capitol Records. The label liked what it heard and offered James a contract.   His first single\, "That's Me Without You\," hit the country Top Ten in early 1953\, but it was three years before "For Rent (One Empty Heart)" became his second big hit. James\, who played guitar on virtually all of his records\, followed up with two 1956 Top Ten near-misses "Twenty Feet of Muddy Water" and "The Cat Came Back." His next single became his biggest hit: "Young Love" spent nine weeks at number one during 1956-1957 and crossed over to top the pop charts also.   Beginning in 1957\, James began to focus his attention on the popular charts. "First Date\, First Kiss\, First Love" made the Top 25\, but no follow-up placed as high. Several of his failures had still managed to go Top Ten on the country charts\, so James returned to country with a vengeance in 1964. "You're the Only World I Know" hit number one country late that year and spent four weeks atop the chart.   That began one of the greatest tears country music has ever known: 21 of his next 25 singles hit number one (and the other four near-misses hit either two or three). James completely dominated the chart from 1964 to 1972\, though only several singles crossed over for modest placements on the popular charts. That fact is somewhat surprising\, since three-quarters of James' number ones had previously been pop hits\, including "Take Good Care of Her" for Adam Wade\, "I'll Never Find Another You" and "A World of Our Own" for the Seekers\, "Born to Be With You" for the Chordettes\, and Roy Orbison's "Only the Lonely." Backed by his Southern Gentlemen band\, James toured the country and overseas\, appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show\, Hee Haw\, and The Bob Hope Show\, and made several movies\, including Las Vegas Hillbillies (1966)\, Second Fiddle to a Steel Guitar (1967)\, and Nashville Rebel (1967). Billboard named him the Number One Artist of 1969.   Even after James' number one streak ended in January 1972\, he continued to place high on the charts. The number two "Only Love Can Break a Heart" (a pop hit for Gene Pitney ten years earlier) was followed by the number ones "That's Why I Love You Like I Do" and -- after moving to Columbia in mid-1972 -- "When the Snow Is on the Roses." James' next chart-topping single\, "Is It Wrong (For Loving You)\," was released in March 1974\, and it began his last major run. He followed with four consecutive Top Ten hits\, "A Mi Esposa con Amor (To My Wife With Love)\," "A Little Bit South of Saskatoon\," "Little Band of Gold\," and "What in the World's Come Over You."   By the early '70s\, James had moved into producing and music publishing also; he oversaw three of Marie Osmond's albums and still managed occasional Top Tens himself. He picked up the prestigious award of Country Music's Male Artist of the Decade from Record World in 1977 and moved to the Monument label in 1979\, then to Dimension two years later. He retired in 1983\, and now raises cattle in Alabama.   ~ John Bush\, All Music Guide  PLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels\, Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

He sold  beer\, cure-all tonics and baby chicks on the local radio. Appeared in films and owned several night clubs. Virtually every major session player in Nashville was a member of The Radio Playboys at one time or another. Infact\, the great Grady Martin started out playing fiddle for Big Jeff in the early days. But most importantly\, Big Jeff recorded some of the most rockingest\, swinginest toe tappin' music ever to come out of Tennessee. It's records like this that helped pave the way for rock'n'roll.

COL title VAL Vehicle COL performer VAL The Links	COL video title VAL NYSF Threepenny Opera - 19 - Call From the Grave COL description VAL This is an LP transfer of the 1976 New York Shakespeare Festival's revival production of "The Threepenny Opera."  This recording should not be confused with the original 1954 New York production recording\, nor the 1994 Donmar Warehouse production recording in England.  Unlike Marc Blitzstein's version which ran during the 1950's for six years and featured the incomparable Lotte Lenya\, this translation is less sanitized and more in keeping with the seedy and sexual nature of the original german play.    From the liner notes to the album - "the successful Blitzstein version was an adaptation rather than a translation\, and in comparing it to the original\, we were surprised at the extent to which his treatment vitiated the political and sexual thrust which gives the work its relentless power.  Blitzstein sweetened and cleaned up Brecht's unsparing lyrics\, partially in deference to stage censorship...but in doing so he in many instances changed Brecht's meanings around entirely\, and throughout he softened the impact of Brecht's biting ferocity.  He also attempted to make the lyrics more 'singable' by fitting them into conventional musical patterns\, and in this he succeeded admirably."  The translation used for this revival was prepared by Ralph Maheim and John Willett; the full text can be found in their edition of Brecht's Collected Plays\, Volume 2.  A hardcover edition was also published in conjunction with the revival.  This revival was directed by conceptual theater artist Richard Foreman\, and starred Raul Julia and Ellen Greene\, both of whom were nominated for Tony Awards.  It was produced by Joseph Papp and the New York Shakespeare Festival at the Vivian Beaumont Theatre at Lincoln Center.  Additional information regarding the production\, including cast list\, can be found at the Internet Broadway Database's listing for this revival at http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=3835 ...  As of June 2007\, this cast album has not been released or reissued on CD; it was originally made available in 1976 on LP\, and this is an LP transfer.  As such\, the quality is not CD quality  - there will occasionally be noise\, popping\, or hissing.

COL title VAL My Mammy COL performer VAL Al Jolson	COL video title VAL Bob Luman - Early in The Morning (1958) COL description VAL Bob Luman on His 4th appearence on Town Hall Party at 1958.  ---ABOUT THE SONG--- "Early In The Morning" [US #24 - 1958] was a song written and recorded by Bobby Darin for Brunswick Records\, but as Darin was still under contract to Atlantic Records' subsidiary\, Atco\, the song was released by "The Ding Dongs". New York deejays liked the record and Atco soon discovered the deception. Brunswick was forced to turn over the masters to Atco which released the record under the name "The Rinky Dinks".  --- ABOUT THE ARTIST--- Bob Luman recieved his early musical influence in Nacogdoches\, Texas\, as his father was an amateur fiddle\, guitar and harmonica player.  In 1956\, he won a talent contest which earned him an appearance on the Louisiana Hayride. For the Hayride\, Luman formed a backup band called the Shadows. In 1957\, the band signed with Imperial Records\, where they recorded "All Night Long" and "Amarillo Blues".That same year\, the band appeared for the first time on the Town Hall Party in Los Angeles\, and appeared in the movie Carnival Rock. In 1958\, dropped by Imperial Records\, Luman signed with Capitol Records\, where he released "Try Me" and "I Know My Baby Cares." Capitol Records wanted Luman to change his name\, which he refused to do\, so he left the record label and signed with Warner Bros. Records\, recording "Class of '59" and "Loretta". In 1960\, Luman was drafted into the United States Army. It was while still in the Army that Warner Bros. Records released Luman's best-known crossover hit\, "Let's Think About Living\," a novelty song that hit #7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and #9 on the Billboard country music chart. After leaving the Army in 1962\, Luman moved to Nashville\, where he married. In 1965\, he joined the Grand Ole Opry. Luman toured frequently in the 60s and 70s\, and became popular in Las Vegas\, with an act which combined country and rockabilly. He signed with Epic Records in 1968\, and had several hits with them\, including "Still Loving You" and "Lonely Women Make Good Lovers" -his biggest country hit\, hitting #4 on the country chart. Luman's other country hits included "Ain't Got Time To Be Unhappy" (1968)\, "Ballad of Two Brothers" (with Autry Inman\, 1968)\, "When You Say Love" (1972)\, "Neither One Of Us (Wants To Be The First To Say Goodbye)" (1973)\, "Proud Of You Baby" (1975)\, and "The Pay Phone" (1977). Luman died in Nashville of pneumonia in 1978\, at the age of forty-one. After his death\, Bear Family Records released several compilations of his songs\, including More of the Rocker\, Still Rockin' and Carnival Rock. Luman is a member of both the Rockabilly Hall of Fame and the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame.  source: www.wikipedia.org COL channel name VAL AugieBurr	0

Warum spricht der alte Mann in seinem Garten zu den Blumen wie mit seiner Frau? Ja das bleibt immer ein Geheimnis\, das weiß niemand so ganz genau. Ja das bleibt immer ein Geheimnis\, das weiß niemand so ganz genau.  Warum tun wir\, wenn wir von Liebe reden\, als gäbs nur Liebe zwischen Mann und Frau? Ja das bleibt immer ein Geheimnis\, das weiß niemand so ganz genau. Ja das bleibt immer ein Geheimnis\, das weiß niemand so ganz genau.  Warum wir Menschen nie in Frieden leben können\, ohne Mauer\, Grenzen\, Drahtverhau - ja das bleibt immer ein Geheimnis\, das weiß niemand so ganz genau. Ja das bleibt immer ein Geheimnis\, das weiß niemand so ganz genau.  Warum ist Töten und ist Töten nicht dasselbe? In Uniform stellt man es noch zur Schau! Ja das bleibt immer ein Geheimnis\, das weiß niemand so ganz genau. Ja das bleibt immer ein Geheimnis\, das weiß niemand so ganz genau.  Wir alle suchen jeden Tag die Wahrheit. Sind wir\, wenn wir sie finden\, alt und grau? Ja das bleibt immer ein Geheimnis\, das weiß niemand so ganz genau. Ja das bleibt immer ein Geheimnis\, das weiß niemand so ganz genau.

Tindley was born in 1851 and died in 1936. He wrote this number in 1905 as "We"ll Understand It Better By and By." He might have recorded the number himself\, but this can't be confirmed. Tindley also wrote the song "I'll Overcome Some Day\," which later became know as "We Shall Overcome." Furthermore\, he wrote the gospel number "Stand By Me." Many sources imply that this is the song with which Ben E. King had a hit in the 1960s\, but that was a different number. However\, Elvis also recorded Tindley's "Stand By Me" for his own "How Great Thou Art" gospel collection. Brothers Frank and James McCravy from Laurens\, South Carolina\, recorded the number as "We'll Understand It Better Bye and Bye" (note the added "e"s on the words "By") in New York in February 1925\, for release on Okeh 40319. This was the McCravy's first recording session\, but they went on to record hundreds of tracks\, often using different names\, such as The Lonesome Pine Twins\, The Austin Brothers\, Al and Joe Blackburn\, Cox and Campbell\, and The Mack Brothers. They ended their recording career in 1935\, by which time they had recorded "We'll Understand It Better Bye and Bye" on at least two more occasions.

COL title VAL Du bist schön COL performer VAL Herman Van Keeken	COL video title VAL Eddy Arnold -- Seven Years With The Wrong Woman (VintageMusic.es) COL description VAL Eddy Arnold\, nacido el 15 de mayo de 1918 en la localidad de Henderson\, condado de Chester\, Tennessee y fallecido el 8 de mayo de 2008 en Franklin\, condado de Williamson\, Tennessee debido a una enfermedad\, fue un músico estadounidense\, especialmente volcado a la música country\, cuyo verdadero nombre era Richard Edward Arnold. Entre su debut en el mundo de la música en 1945 y 1954\, Eddie logró 58 top ten consecutivos\, y nunca marcó menos de un top 40 durante sus 21 años de carrera\, con más de 140 discos diferentes de los cuales se vendieron más de 85 millones de copias\, incluidos eternos clásicos como Bouquet de Rosas o Anytime. Recibió el apodo de Tennessee Plowboy (el chico del arado de Tennessee en inglés)\, y firmó contratos con las compañías discográficas RCA Records y MGM Records.  Richard Edward Arnold nació en Henderson\, en el condado de Chester\, estado de Tennessee\, el 15 de mayo de 1918 y se educó en el medio rural. Su padre era un violinista que alentó a su hijo respecto del desarrollo de sus talentos musicales y logró reunir el dinero suficiente para comprar a su niño una guitarra a la edad de 10 años. Para cuando entró en la escuela secundaria Eddie Arnols ya era toda una estrella local\, pero con la llegada de la Gran Depresión en 1929 y la crisis económica de los años 1930\, Eddy tuvo que dejar la escuela para ayudar trabajar como asistente en una funeraria. Relegó sus actuaciones musicales a funciones locales\, aunque de vez en cuando viajaba montado en una mula con su guitarra a la espalda.  Al igual que otros artistas del country de la época\, Eddy consiguió su pase al estrellato con sus apariciones en vivo por la radio\, antes de debutar en Jackson\, en Tennessee\, en 1936 y posteriormente en San Luis\, en el estado de Misuri.  Entre 1940 y 1943 apareció en el Grand Ole Opry junto a Pee Wee King. Apodado como el chico del arado de Tennessee (o Tennessee Plowboy\, en inglés) firmó con la RCA Victor Records un contrato en 1944 con ese nombre\, que fue el que apareció en sus discos hasta 1954. Con el tema Every hour Seems A Million Years alcanzó el quinto disco de su carrera\, dando con dicho disco comienzo a la cadena de 58 consecutivos éxitos top ten. En 1947 Arnold logró sus tres primeros éxitos número uno\, siendo uno de ellos número uno durante 21 semanas. Eddy Arnold realizó temas universalmente populares convirtiéndose en una estrella perenne\, grabando discos durante un período de cinco décadas\, desde los años 1960 hasta los años 1980; tras una pausa de siete años incluso regresó al estudio en 1990.  Además de establecer un nivel inigualable dada su avanzada edad\, Arnold se convirtió en un ejemplo de cómo manejar su fortuna en el mundo del espectáculo. "Guardo mi primer dólar y sigo ahorrando e invirtiendo mi dinero"\, recuerda\, "nunca olvidé cómo se sentía ser pobre"\, añadió. Eddie Anold se convirtió en uno de los hombres más ricos de la industria mediante la inversión en la única cosa que él consideraba de valor de propiedad\, "la tierra". Debido a su enorme popularidad musical Eddy Arnold se convirtió en un auténtico embajador de la música country a nivel mundial   Spotify:http://open.spotify.com/album/4tQOsxLgCwxPCRNS5LeWxN iTunes:http://itunes.apple.com/es/album/vintage-country-no-11-ep-all/id374306958 Síguenos en: Spotify: https://goo.gl/raouHQ Facebook: https://goo.gl/L92BHL Instagram: https://goo.gl/3oYDGH Web: http://www.vintagemusic.es   Compra nuestros Cd's en formato físico en estas plataformas: Ebay:  http://stores.ebay.com/VintageMusicFm BoutiqAlia: www.boutiqalia-vintagemusic.com Discogs: https://www.discogs.com/es/seller/vintagemusicfm/profile COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm	0

Well the both 12" versions low down and girl you are the one are just as long as the album versions. Alfonzo was a great singer\, with some good songs\, but to my opinion\, they should have launched him as an artist in his own right and not just a copycat of Michal Jackson. This last fact was surely true for his looks. Sadly enough he faded away from the scene\, maybe a wrong choice of managment or something like that. He was a great singer! This song is an absolutely favourite of mine! Anyone knows what happend to him? COL channel name VAL peterpiessens	0

The record was released in June 1979 on Optional Music with "The Man with the Dogs" as the b-side. The title track was re-recorded for the band's first album\, Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables (1980)\, and the version that appeared on this single\, as well as the single's b-side\, are available on the rarities album Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death (1987).  The lyrics were written by Jello Biafra and John Greenway\, and Biafra composed the music in one of his rare attempts at composing on bass.  This song was featured in the video game Tony Hawk's American Wasteland and as a downloadable song in the Rock Band series. It is also sampled in a song by the dance-punk/big beat trio The Prodigy\, "Dead Ken Beats". The song was also featured in the 2010 film The Social Network.  Meaning  The title is an allusion to the first (and no longer sung) stanza of the national anthem of Germany\, which begins with the words "Deutschland\, Deutschland über alles." (literally\, "Germany\, Germany above all.")  The song focuses on Jerry Brown\, the Governor of California 1975-1983 and 2011--present\, and is sung from his perspective. An imaginary Brown outlines a hippie-fascist vision for America\, in which his "suede denim secret police" kill un-cool people with "organic poison gas" chambers. Lines such as "Serpent's egg already hatched" (a reference to a line from William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar) comment on the corrosive nature of power. The line "now it is 1984" refers to the totalitarian regime of George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four\, describing a future (from 1979) where Jerry Brown has become President Brown presiding over secret police and gas chambers.  Cover versions  Blue Ribbon Glee Club regularly perform their version of the song.  The song was updated by The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy when they released a cover version in 1992 on the album Hypocrisy is the Greatest Legacy. They replaced references to Jerry Brown with references to Pete Wilson.  The song was also widely known in Poland (as "Kalifornia Ponad Wszystko") thanks to the cover by Polish rocker Kazik Staszewski with his band Kazik Na Żywo.  Hasidic New Wave perform a remake of the song on their 1999 album\, Kabalogy. In their version\, titled "Giuliani Über Alles"\, Jerry Brown is replaced by former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani.  The Delgados cover the song in their Peel Sessions CD set.  Six Feet Under do a cover the song on their Graveyard Classics album.  The black metal band Mayhem also covered the song.  Deceased covered the song on their punk covers album Rotten to the Core.  The hardcore band Ceremony has covered the song.  The Who Boys have done a mashup of "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" by Gil Scott-Heron called "Revolution Über Alles".  John Linnell and his band The Statesmen covered it live at least once during his "State Songs" tour\, choosing to perform it because it mentioned the state of California.  Dramarama has recorded a version\, updated in 2003 about California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger... "You will lift weights in school".  A 1986 live recording focused on Ronald Reagan on the album Mutiny On The Bay with live recordings from 1982 and 1986.  Jayne County covered the song with She Wolves about California's Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The green vinyl single was released under artist name Jayne County Meets The She Wolves by the German label Trash 2001.  Mexican death metal band Brujería covers Dead Kennedys with the song "California Uber Aztlan" in 2010. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

COL title VAL The Stripper COL performer VAL Bobby Crush	COL video title VAL Jimmy Bruno feat. Joey DeFrancesco - Unit Seven (from cd: Like That\, 1995) COL description VAL Performed: Jimmy Bruno\, feat. Joey DeFrancesco Composed: Sam Jones Cd: "Like That"\, Recording Date: August 30\, 1995 - August 31\, 1995  Release Date: April 30\, 1996   Subscribe Here: http://www.youtube.com/user/TheSouLighting http://www.facebook.com/thesoulighting  Jimmy Bruno\, born July 22\, 1953 in Philadelphia\, Pennsylvania\, is a master jazz guitarist and jazz educator. He started playing at the age of 7. He began his professional career at the age of 19\, touring with Buddy Rich. Among his many credits\, he is the only guitarist to have ever led Frank Sinatra's band. He played for many years in Los Angeles before returning to the Philadelphia area. He counts Johnny Smith\, Hank Garland\, Joe Pass\, Tal Farlow\, Wes Montgomery\, Howard Roberts\, Jim Hall\, and Pat Martino amongst his influences. In March\, 2011 Jimmy opened up Jimmy Bruno's Guitar Workshop\, a website that allows students to learn directly from Jimmy through video lessons.  For more information: http://jimmybruno.com/biography.php  Although Like That was recorded in New York\, many of the people involved with the project were Philadelphians. The pleasing hard bop date unites Jimmy Bruno's Philly-based trio of the 1990s (which includes bassist Craig Thomas and drummer Steve Holloway) with organist/trumpeter and Philly native Joey DeFrancesco\, Although DeFrancesco plays organ on most of the 11 songs\, he switches to the trumpet and favors a Miles Davis-influenced mute on relaxed versions of "There Is No Greater Love" and "Stars Fell on Alabama."   Ο Jimmy Bruno γεννήθηκε στις 22 Ιουλίου 1953\, στην Πενσυλβάνια και είναι ένας Αμερικανός master κιθαρίστας και διδάσκαλος της τζαζ. Παίζει από ηλικία 7 ετών και ξεκίνησε την επαγγελματική του καριέρα στην ηλικία των 19\, περιοδεύοντας με τον Buddy Rich. Μεταξύ των πολλών του διακρίσεων\, είναι ότι ήταν ο μόνος επικεφαλής κιθαρίστας της μπάντας του Frank Sinatra. Έπαιξε για πολλά χρόνια στο Λος Άντζελες πριν από την επιστροφή στην  Φιλαδέλφεια. Έχει επηρεαστεί\, μεταξύ άλλων\, από τους  Johnny Smith\, Hank Garland\, Joe Pass\, Tal Farlow\, Wes Montgomery\, Howard Roberts\, Jim Hall\, and Pat Martino. Από τον Μάρτιο του 2011\, άνοιξε την ιστοσελίδα: Jimmy Bruno's Guitar Workshop\,  που επιτρέπει στους μαθητές του να εξασκηθούν απευθείας από τον Bruno μέσω βίντεο μαθημάτων. Περισσότερες πληροφορίες: http://jimmybruno.com/biography.php  Το μουσικό κομμάτι “Unit Seven” είναι το από το cd του 1996 με τίτλο “Like That”\, που ηχογραφήθηκε στη Νέα Υόρκη και οι περισσότεροι μουσικοί ήταν από την Φιλαδέλφεια. Στο βασικό του τρίο (με μπάσσο τον Craig Thomas και ντράμμερ τον Steve Holloway) της περιόδου του 1990\, προστέθηκε ο  οργανίστας/τρομπετίστας Joey DeFrancesco (επίσης από την Φιλαδέλφεια).  Ο Joey DeFrancesco παίζει όργανο στα περισσότερα από τα 11 κομμάτια\, αλλά και τρομπέτα βαθειά επηρεασμένος από τον τρόπο του Miles Davis (κυρίως στα "There Is No Greater Love" και "Stars Fell on Alabama.")

COL title VAL Jeanne d'Arc COL performer VAL Claudia Scott	COL video title VAL Joan of Arc (Leonard Cohen) - Allison Crowe w. lyrics COL description VAL On her debut album "secrets" Allison Crowe covers this Leonard Cohen song. Her voice and piano is accompanied by Jo Lundstrom (Rosehip Jam\, Black Velvet Band) on accordion. Crowe engineered the recording\, with production by Rainer Willeke (of Victoria\, B.C.'s Raindog Studios).  http://music.allisoncrowe.com/track/joan-of-arc  The photo of Allison Crowe is by Billie Woods.  MOJO magazine's December '08 issue paid tribute to "Rock's Greatest Poet" Leonard Cohen with a celebration of his "deep and moving music". Of Allison Crowe's contribution of "Joan of Arc" to its 'All Star Tribute"\, (featuring Judy Collins\, Nick Cave\, Katie Melua\, Martha Wainwright\, Dion and others)\, a cover-mount CD titled "Cohen Covered"\, MOJO says: "Once famously described by the Vancouver Courier as possessing a style akin to 'Elton John meets Edith Piaf'\, the Canadian singer-songwriter Allison Crowe is renowned for her ability to blend control and melodrama. Certainly she does so on this spirited cover of Cohen's 'Songs of Love and Hate' classic\, a track which also powerfully showcases her considerable talent as a fine interpreter of song."  "Any album that features a track from Leonard Cohen is certainly heading in the right direction. But when it is covered so beautifully\, it makes you realise what an amazing lyricist Leonard Cohen is. Joan of Arc is the Cohen song covered on this album and it's certainly in my top 10 of Cohen covers. It's also my favorite track on (Secrets)" ~ Colin Meeks\, indielaunchpad.com (USA)  Joan of Arc  Words & Music by Leonard Cohen As performed by Allison Crowe  Now the flames they followed Joan of Arc as she came riding through the dark; no moon to keep her armour bright\, no man to get her through this dark and smoky night.   She said\, "I'm tired of the war\, I want the kind of work I had before\, A wedding dress or something white to wear upon my swollen appetite."  Well\, I'm glad to hear you talk this way\, I've watched you riding every day and there is something in me that yearns to win such a cold\, such a lonesome heroine.  "And who are you?" she sternly spoke to the one beneath the smoke. "Why\, I'm fire\," he replied\, "And I love your solitude\, I love your pride."  "Well\, then\, fire make your body cold\, I'm going to give you mine to hold." And saying this she climbed inside to be his one\, to be his only bride.  Then deep into his fiery heart he took the dust of Joan of Arc\, and high above all these wedding guests he hung the ashes of her lovely wedding dress.  It was deep into his fiery heart he took the dust of Joan of Arc\, and then she clearly understood if he was fire\, oh\, she must be wood.  I saw her wince\, I saw her cry\, I saw the glory in her eye. Myself I long for love and light\, but must it come so cruel\,  must it be so bright? COL channel name VAL Allison Crowe	1

Lo que atrae de los covers como siempre e dicho\, es la curiosidad de como se escucha tal cancion con tal vocalista\, el morbo de escuchar una cancion tocada por diferentes personas.  Para disfrutar de este recopilatoria\, tienes que quitarte la imagen de como es la cancion\, no esperes algo igual o "muy parecido"\, recordemos que cada musico aporta algo que hace unica cualquier cancion\, ya sea un cover como es este caso.  Como se observa en la track list\, hay una gran variedad de musicos\, entre ellos vi a Paul Di'anno\, que como todos saben fue ex-integrante de Iron Maiden\, no podian faltar Lemmy o Ripper\, tambien veo a chuck de testament\, tambien esta Chris Jericho de WWE que la neta yo ni sabia que tenia una banda.  En fin hay para todos los gustos\, lo unico malo que vi en el disco es que faltaron algunos temas. COL channel name VAL el juanito	0

Ward	COL video title VAL Bull Doze Blues COL description VAL One of Henry Thomas' most renowned recording which was covered to great acclaim in the 1960's by Blues Rock band Canned Heat. Henry Thomas was more a Songster than a Blues musician who played his own reworks of traditionals and standards alike with the unique touch of the Quills which he plays along with the Guitar in a style which appears to be completely individual for Thomas as a Musician.  Lyrics from Weeniepedia  Bull Doze Blues - Henry Thomas  I'm going away\, babe\, and it won't be long I'm going away and it won't be long I'm going away and it won't be long  Just as sure as that train leaves out of that Mobile yard Just as sure as that train leaves out of that Mobile yard Just as sure as that train leaves out of that Mobile yard  Come shake your hand\, tell your papa goodbye Come shake your hand\, tell your papa goodbye Come shake your hand\, tell your papa goodbye  I'm going back to Tennessee I'm going back to Memphis\, Tennessee I'm going back\, Memphis\, Tennessee  I'm going where I never get bulldozed I'm going where I never get the bulldoze I'm going where I never get bulldozed  If you don't believe I'm sinking\, look what a hole I'm in If you don't believe I'm sinking\, look what a hole I'm in If you don't believe I'm sinking\, look what a fool I've been.  Oh\, my babe\, take me back. How in the world\, Lord\, take me back. COL channel name VAL PreWarMusic	0

The record was released in June 1979 on Optional Music with "The Man with the Dogs" as the b-side. The title track was re-recorded for the band's first album\, Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables (1980)\, and the version that appeared on this single\, as well as the single's b-side\, are available on the rarities album Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death (1987).  The lyrics were written by Jello Biafra and John Greenway\, and Biafra composed the music in one of his rare attempts at composing on bass.  This song was featured in the video game Tony Hawk's American Wasteland and as a downloadable song in the Rock Band series. It is also sampled in a song by the dance-punk/big beat trio The Prodigy\, "Dead Ken Beats". The song was also featured in the 2010 film The Social Network.  Meaning  The title is an allusion to the first (and no longer sung) stanza of the national anthem of Germany\, which begins with the words "Deutschland\, Deutschland über alles." (literally\, "Germany\, Germany above all.")  The song focuses on Jerry Brown\, the Governor of California 1975-1983 and 2011--present\, and is sung from his perspective. An imaginary Brown outlines a hippie-fascist vision for America\, in which his "suede denim secret police" kill un-cool people with "organic poison gas" chambers. Lines such as "Serpent's egg already hatched" (a reference to a line from William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar) comment on the corrosive nature of power. The line "now it is 1984" refers to the totalitarian regime of George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four\, describing a future (from 1979) where Jerry Brown has become President Brown presiding over secret police and gas chambers.  Cover versions  Blue Ribbon Glee Club regularly perform their version of the song.  The song was updated by The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy when they released a cover version in 1992 on the album Hypocrisy is the Greatest Legacy. They replaced references to Jerry Brown with references to Pete Wilson.  The song was also widely known in Poland (as "Kalifornia Ponad Wszystko") thanks to the cover by Polish rocker Kazik Staszewski with his band Kazik Na Żywo.  Hasidic New Wave perform a remake of the song on their 1999 album\, Kabalogy. In their version\, titled "Giuliani Über Alles"\, Jerry Brown is replaced by former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani.  The Delgados cover the song in their Peel Sessions CD set.  Six Feet Under do a cover the song on their Graveyard Classics album.  The black metal band Mayhem also covered the song.  Deceased covered the song on their punk covers album Rotten to the Core.  The hardcore band Ceremony has covered the song.  The Who Boys have done a mashup of "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" by Gil Scott-Heron called "Revolution Über Alles".  John Linnell and his band The Statesmen covered it live at least once during his "State Songs" tour\, choosing to perform it because it mentioned the state of California.  Dramarama has recorded a version\, updated in 2003 about California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger... "You will lift weights in school".  A 1986 live recording focused on Ronald Reagan on the album Mutiny On The Bay with live recordings from 1982 and 1986.  Jayne County covered the song with She Wolves about California's Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The green vinyl single was released under artist name Jayne County Meets The She Wolves by the German label Trash 2001.  Mexican death metal band Brujería covers Dead Kennedys with the song "California Uber Aztlan" in 2010. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

Parker acquired the nickname "Yardbird" early in his career and the shortened form\, "Bird"\, which continued to be used for the rest of his life\, inspired the titles of a number of Parker compositions\, such as "Yardbird Suite"\, "Ornithology"\, "Bird Gets the Worm"\, and "Bird of Paradise." Parker was a highly influential jazz soloist and a leading figure in the development of bebop\, a form of jazz characterized by fast tempos\, virtuosic technique\, and improvisation. Parker introduced revolutionary harmonic ideas\, including rapid passing chords\, new variants of altered chords\, and chord substitutions. His tone ranged from clean and penetrating to sweet and somber. Many Parker recordings demonstrate virtuosic technique and complex melodic lines\, sometimes combining jazz with other musical genres\, including blues\, Latin\, and classical. Parker was an icon for the hipster subculture and later the Beat Generation\, personifying the jazz musician as an uncompromising artist and intellectual\, rather than an entertainer... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Parker   A link to this wonderful artist's personal website: http://www.cmgww.com/music/parker/home.html   Please Enjoy!

COL title VAL Chelsea Hotel No. 2 COL performer VAL Allison Crowe and Band	COL video title VAL Huey "Piano" Smith - High Blood Pressure COL description VAL Huey "Piano" Smith was an important part of the great New Orleans piano tradition\, following in the footsteps of Professor Longhair and Fats Domino to take his place among the Crescent City's R&B elite. He was also one of R&B's great comedians\, his best singles matching the Coasters for genial\, good-time humor\, although his taste often ran more towards nonsense lyrics. Smith's sound was too earthy to match the pop crossover appeal of Domino or the Coasters\, which limited his exposure\, and he couldn't match the latter's amazing consistency\, lacking their reliable supply of material. But at the peak of his game\, Smith epitomized New Orleans R&B at its most infectious and rollicking\, as showcased on his classic signature tune "Rockin' Pneumonia and the Boogie Woogie Flu."   Huey Smith was born in New Orleans on January 26\, 1934\, and began playing the piano at age 15. At the dawn of the '50s\, Smith backed New Orleans guitar legends Earl King and Guitar Slim\, and quickly became a popular session pianist\, playing on records by the cream of the New Orleans R&B scene: Smiley Lewis (the classic "I Hear You Knockin'")\, Lloyd Price\, and Little Richard. During the mid-'50s\, Smith began leading his own band\, the Clowns\, which usually featured popular local blues singer and female impersonator Bobby Marchan on lead vocals. Smith & the Clowns signed with the Ace label and scored a breakout Top Five R&B hit in 1957 with "Rockin' Pneumonia and the Boogie Woogie Flu\," which despite becoming a classic rock & roll standard didn't even make the pop Top 40\, thanks to reticent white radio programmers. The following year\, Smith scored his biggest hit with the double-sided smash "Don't You Just Know It"/"High Blood Pressure\," which reached the pop Top Ten and the R&B Top Five. In 1959\, Smith cut the original tune "Sea Cruise\," and seeking pop radio airplay\, Ace had white teenage R&B singer Frankie Ford overdub his own vocal onto Smith's backing track; the result became a nationwide hit.   Smith cut a few novelty numbers in an attempt to duplicate the success of "Rockin' Pneumonia\," some even using the same type of illness joke ("Tu-Ber-Cu-Lucas and the Sinus Blues\," for example). It didn't work\, and Marchan left the Clowns after scoring a solo hit with "There Is Something on Your Mind" in 1960; he was replaced by female singer Gerry Hall and male vocalist Curley Moore. Smith switched briefly to the Imperial label\, then returned to Ace for one last chart single in 1962\, "Pop Eye." Smith spent part of the '60s recording for Instant and touring not only with the Clowns\, but alternate groups the Hueys and the Pitter Pats as well. Unable to return to the charts\, he eventually converted to the Jehovah's Witnesses and left the music industry permanently. ~ Steve Huey\, All Music Guide  PLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels\, Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

COL title VAL Kokomo COL performer VAL The Vandals	COL video title VAL Leslie West - Politician.wmv COL description VAL Leslie West - Got Blooze (2005) Guitar hero Leslie West has issued countless albums over the years\, mostly either as a member of Mountain or as a solo artist. But he has never set out to record an album comprised entirely of classic blues rockers. Then 2005's Got Blooze came along. While this sort of thing has been done by countless fellow veteran classic rock acts of late (the best-known of the bunch being Aerosmith's Honkin' on Bobo)\, it turns out to be custom-made for a player like West. Throughout the 12-track set\, West keeps things raw and gritty\, as evidenced by such standouts as the extraordinary "Third Degree" and a cover of the oft-overlooked Cream gem\, "Politician." West also surrounds himself with a fantastic rhythm section\, comprised of Vanilla Fudge's Tim Bogert on bass and session ace Aynsley Dunbar on drums (turns out the pair pulled double duty\, as they also backed ex-Ozzy Osbourne guitarist Jake E. Lee on an additional album full of covers\, Retraced). While we probably could have done without the umpteenth cover of "Baby Please Don't Go" (AC/DC\, Aerosmith\, Ted Nugent\, and countless others have played it over the years)\, overall\, Got Blooze is a welcome return for West\, and easily his strongest\, most focused work in quite some time.

COL title VAL Sentimental Me COL performer VAL Jack Jersey	COL video title VAL Streets of Baltimore - Nanci Griffith and John Prine COL description VAL from her album\, "Other Voices\, Too - A Trip Back to Bountiful"\, released in 1998. This is Nanci's 15th album and she is joined with other artists. She considers this a follow up to her album\, "Other Voices\, Other Rooms" which was released in 1993. In this album her focus on songwriters is so much a part of the album's spirit. The writers whose songs Nanci has selected range from the well-known\, like British folk-pop artists Richard Thompson and Sandy Denny\, early American rocker Sonny Curtis\, American folksingers Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger and country legend Johnny Cash\, to lesser known writers like John Grimaudo\, Saylor White\, Ian Tyson and Texas songwriter Mickie Merkens\, to Stephen Foster\, perhaps the greatest American songwriter of the 19th century. "We started with several songs that spilled over from the last album\, like Richard Thompson's 'Wall Of Death' and Stephen Foster's 'Hard Times Come Again No More\,' then we went back to the list of songs I felt weren't sung enough".  At times\, we had so many people in the studio -- like when we had 37 for "Wasn't That A Mighty Storm" -- and they wouldn't leave! The beer was free\, the food was good\, everyone got to meet their heroes. It was just so exciting to bring people together.  quotes from Nanci Griffith found on the site homepages.sover.net/~rschrull/ngriffith/othertoo/othertoo.html  I do not own this song.

COL title VAL Steppin' Out COL performer VAL Claire Martin & Richard Rodney Bennett	COL video title VAL LURLEAN HUNTER  Vocal Jazz Swing. Steppin' Out With My Baby \, I Feel COL description VAL Lurlean Hunter  Singer Lurlean Hunter made five albums on her own during the second half of the '50s\, starting out as a Lonesome Gal on RCA and winding up still feeling Blue & Sentimental for Atlantic. She was discovered in Chicago where she had been singing in many clubs\, including a collaboration with drummer Red Saunders that held forth at the Club DeLisa. Hunter's move to New York City in 1955 was prompted by RCA's interest in recording her. The singer's recording career actually began before she left the Windy City at the behest of indie jazz labels\, some of them quite short-lived -- such as Seymour\, with a catalog topping out at four releases. The press described Hunter as a "blues thrush" in announcing her interpretations of three numbers actually written by the label's owner\, producer and record store owner Seymour Schwartz. The latter promotional blurb inevitably told some truth about Hunter's stylistic traits\, if not her relation to winged fauna. Her recordings were more about rhythm & blues and pop than jazz\, yet were done in an era when such sessions often involved fine mainstream jazz players in the accompaniment. The 1956Night Life\, for example\, featured pianist Hank Jones and tenor saxophonist Al Cohn. Blue & Sentimental -- with arrangements by the progressive Jimmy Giuffre -- was reissued in 2000 as a split CD also including an album by fellow singer Betty Bennett\, a former wife of pianist André Previn.Hunter's final recordings were done in 1964\, at which point she was still well under 40 years old. She is known to have died young\, although details of this tragedy are murky. In one version of the story she was knocked off by a mobster lover\, yet whether anybody was really that mean to Lurlean cannot be completely confirmed.

COL title VAL Why Can't We Live Together COL performer VAL Blow Up [1]	COL video title VAL Elly Lapp - Ich weiß es wird einmal ein Wunder gescheh'n COL description VAL Elly Lapp Ganz nah  Genre: Deutsch-Pop\, Chanson\, Schlager   „Eine Stimme die unter die Haut geht.  Eindringlich\, lasziv\, ganz nah."   Elly Lapp liebt die Brückenschläge. Für sie sind UFA-Schlager und Popmusik keine  unarrangierbaren Gegensätze\, sondern interpretatorische Herausforderung. Dabei ist eine sehr moderne CD entstanden\,  die gleichzeitig sehr intensiv und sehr persönlich ist. Viel näher geht`s nicht.   Es waren große Songs -- es sind große Songs. Dazu leistet eine interessante Interpretin ihren Beitrag. Elly Lapp. Die studierte Schauspielerin und Sängerin tourt mit eigenen Programmen durch Deutschland -- und sie war die Stimme des Titelsongs der erfolgreichen ARD-Fernsehserie „Kir Royal".  „Der Wind hat mir ein Lied erzählt" - gleichzeitig erste Single - und „Ich steh` im Regen" sind Versuche einer ungewöhnlichen Verbindung von UFA - HIT und POPSOUND. Zarah Leander machte einst diese Songs zu Welterfolgen. Damals hatten die Autoren wohl nie eine Umsetzung mit rockigen Gitarren oder Saxophon im Auge. Hier geben die modernen Instrumente\, wie das gesamte Pop- Arrangement\, eine ganz neue Farbe -- voller Intensität.  Doch die CD von Elly Lapp zeigt die großen Filmhits nicht nur im Popgewand\, sondern auch sehr sparsam\, kunstvoll arrangiert\, als Chansons mit großer interpretatorischer Tiefe.  z.B." Wenn ich mir was wünschen dürfte" und - vor allem - „Der Nowack lässt mich nicht verkommen" -\, ein wahrer Kultsong\, 1959 geschrieben\, sofort auf Schallplatte aufgenommen\, kurzerhand von einem Münchner Gericht verboten und wieder eingestampft -- eine echte Rarität für jedes Rundfunk- und Privatarchiv!

COL title VAL (Something Inside) So Strong COL performer VAL Kenny Rogers	COL video title VAL John Fogerty - Have Thine Own Way\, Lord.wmv COL description VAL The Blue Ridge Rangers Is the first solo album by John Fogerty\, the former lead singer and lead guitarist of Creedence Clearwater Revival. Upon its initial release by Fantasy Records in 1973\, the album was credited to "The Blue Ridge Rangers" with no mention of Fogerty on the cover. Fogerty chose to do this in order to distance himself from his Creedence legacy. The LP was later reissued and credited to John Fogerty with a different cover design. The CD reissue restores the original silhouette cover photo and credits the album to Fogerty. The album is made up entirely of traditional and country covers\, and features Fogerty playing all the instruments. The album peaked at #47 on the charts. Two singles from the album became hits: "Jambalaya" which peaked at #16\, and "Hearts of Stone" which peaked at #37. In 2009\, Fogerty released a sequel to this album\, entitled The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again.  Track listing Side one 1. "Blue Ridge Mountain Blues" (Traditional) -- 2:29 2.

'Spirit of '73: Rock For Choice' was put together by the activist group Feminist Majority with proceeds going to support the Becky Bell/Rosie Jimenez Campaign "to lift consent laws and federal funding restrictions that are forcing young women to turn to back-alley abortions". The compilation's title is inspired by the January 22\, 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion in the United States. The songs included are all contemporary artists of 1995 covering songs that were popular in the early 1970s.

The english lyrics (well known by the classic Leonard Cohen cover) were written by Hy Zaret.  Bertrand Cantat of Noir Desir provides some french vocals...  LYRICS When they poured across the border I was cautioned to surrender\, this I could not do; I took my gun and vanished.  I have changed my name so often\, I've lost my wife and children but I have many friends\, and some of them are with me.  An old woman gave us shelter\, Kept us hidden in the garret\, then the soldiers came; she died without a whisper.  There were three of us this morning I'm the only one this evening but I must go on; the frontiers are my prison.  Oh\, the wind\, the wind is blowing\, through the graves the wind is blowing\, freedom soon will come; then we'll come from the shadows.  Les Allemands étaient chez moi\, ils me dirent\, "Résigne toi\," mais je n'ai pas peur; j'ai repris mon âme.  (The Germans were at my home They said\, "Sign yourself\," But I am not afraid I have retaken my soul.)  J'ai changé cent fois de nom\, j'ai perdu femme et enfants mais j'ai tant d'amis; j'ai la France entière.  (I've changed names a hundred times I have lost wife and children But I have so many friends I have all of France)  Un vieil homme dans un grenier pour la nuit nous a caché\, les Allemands l'ont pris; il est mort sans surprise.  (An old man\, in an attic Hid us for the night The Germans captured him He died without surprise.)  Oh\, the wind\, the wind is blowing\, through the graves the wind is blowing\, freedom soon will come; then we'll come from the shadows. COL channel name VAL TinderNikos	0

Tindley was born in 1851 and died in 1936. He wrote this number in 1905 as "We"ll Understand It Better By and By." He might have recorded the number himself\, but this can't be confirmed. Tindley also wrote the song "I'll Overcome Some Day\," which later became know as "We Shall Overcome." Furthermore\, he wrote the gospel number "Stand By Me." Many sources imply that this is the song with which Ben E. King had a hit in the 1960s\, but that was a different number. However\, Elvis also recorded Tindley's "Stand By Me" for his own "How Great Thou Art" gospel collection. Brothers Frank and James McCravy from Laurens\, South Carolina\, recorded the number as "We'll Understand It Better Bye and Bye" (note the added "e"s on the words "By") in New York in February 1925\, for release on Okeh 40319. This was the McCravy's first recording session\, but they went on to record hundreds of tracks\, often using different names\, such as The Lonesome Pine Twins\, The Austin Brothers\, Al and Joe Blackburn\, Cox and Campbell\, and The Mack Brothers. They ended their recording career in 1935\, by which time they had recorded "We'll Understand It Better Bye and Bye" on at least two more occasions.

COL title VAL Zombie COL performer VAL Miser	COL video title VAL LURLEAN HUNTER  Vocal Jazz Swing. Steppin' Out With My Baby \, I Feel COL description VAL Lurlean Hunter  Singer Lurlean Hunter made five albums on her own during the second half of the '50s\, starting out as a Lonesome Gal on RCA and winding up still feeling Blue & Sentimental for Atlantic. She was discovered in Chicago where she had been singing in many clubs\, including a collaboration with drummer Red Saunders that held forth at the Club DeLisa. Hunter's move to New York City in 1955 was prompted by RCA's interest in recording her. The singer's recording career actually began before she left the Windy City at the behest of indie jazz labels\, some of them quite short-lived -- such as Seymour\, with a catalog topping out at four releases. The press described Hunter as a "blues thrush" in announcing her interpretations of three numbers actually written by the label's owner\, producer and record store owner Seymour Schwartz. The latter promotional blurb inevitably told some truth about Hunter's stylistic traits\, if not her relation to winged fauna. Her recordings were more about rhythm & blues and pop than jazz\, yet were done in an era when such sessions often involved fine mainstream jazz players in the accompaniment. The 1956Night Life\, for example\, featured pianist Hank Jones and tenor saxophonist Al Cohn. Blue & Sentimental -- with arrangements by the progressive Jimmy Giuffre -- was reissued in 2000 as a split CD also including an album by fellow singer Betty Bennett\, a former wife of pianist André Previn.Hunter's final recordings were done in 1964\, at which point she was still well under 40 years old. She is known to have died young\, although details of this tragedy are murky. In one version of the story she was knocked off by a mobster lover\, yet whether anybody was really that mean to Lurlean cannot be completely confirmed.

COL title VAL Willie and Laura Mae Jones COL performer VAL The Persuasions	COL video title VAL Sonny James - Endlessly (The Johnny Cash Show - Jan 27\, 1971) COL description VAL Sonny James\, the Southern Gentleman\, used the popular Nashville sound of the '60s to countrify pop hits of the past into a form accessible to many\, broadening country music's appeal across the nation. James even moved over to the pop charts for a time in the late '50s but found the secret of his success by the time he returned to country. During the late '60s\, he scored an incredible five-year run of number one singles which locked up the top spot for a combined 45 weeks during the late '60s.   Born James Loden on May 1\, 1929\, he began performing with his show-business family at the age of three and played with his four sisters as the Loden Family while in his teens. The group appeared around the South and on radio shows like the Louisiana Hayride and Saturday Night Shindig. After spending time overseas during the Korean War\, Loden took Sonny James as his stage name -- after his teenage nickname -- and joined the local bar circuit. He met and played with Chet Atkins\, who later got him a tryout with Capitol Records. The label liked what it heard and offered James a contract.   His first single\, "That's Me Without You\," hit the country Top Ten in early 1953\, but it was three years before "For Rent (One Empty Heart)" became his second big hit. James\, who played guitar on virtually all of his records\, followed up with two 1956 Top Ten near-misses "Twenty Feet of Muddy Water" and "The Cat Came Back." His next single became his biggest hit: "Young Love" spent nine weeks at number one during 1956-1957 and crossed over to top the pop charts also.   Beginning in 1957\, James began to focus his attention on the popular charts. "First Date\, First Kiss\, First Love" made the Top 25\, but no follow-up placed as high. Several of his failures had still managed to go Top Ten on the country charts\, so James returned to country with a vengeance in 1964. "You're the Only World I Know" hit number one country late that year and spent four weeks atop the chart.   That began one of the greatest tears country music has ever known: 21 of his next 25 singles hit number one (and the other four near-misses hit either two or three). James completely dominated the chart from 1964 to 1972\, though only several singles crossed over for modest placements on the popular charts. That fact is somewhat surprising\, since three-quarters of James' number ones had previously been pop hits\, including "Take Good Care of Her" for Adam Wade\, "I'll Never Find Another You" and "A World of Our Own" for the Seekers\, "Born to Be With You" for the Chordettes\, and Roy Orbison's "Only the Lonely." Backed by his Southern Gentlemen band\, James toured the country and overseas\, appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show\, Hee Haw\, and The Bob Hope Show\, and made several movies\, including Las Vegas Hillbillies (1966)\, Second Fiddle to a Steel Guitar (1967)\, and Nashville Rebel (1967). Billboard named him the Number One Artist of 1969.   Even after James' number one streak ended in January 1972\, he continued to place high on the charts. The number two "Only Love Can Break a Heart" (a pop hit for Gene Pitney ten years earlier) was followed by the number ones "That's Why I Love You Like I Do" and -- after moving to Columbia in mid-1972 -- "When the Snow Is on the Roses." James' next chart-topping single\, "Is It Wrong (For Loving You)\," was released in March 1974\, and it began his last major run. He followed with four consecutive Top Ten hits\, "A Mi Esposa con Amor (To My Wife With Love)\," "A Little Bit South of Saskatoon\," "Little Band of Gold\," and "What in the World's Come Over You."   By the early '70s\, James had moved into producing and music publishing also; he oversaw three of Marie Osmond's albums and still managed occasional Top Tens himself. He picked up the prestigious award of Country Music's Male Artist of the Decade from Record World in 1977 and moved to the Monument label in 1979\, then to Dimension two years later. He retired in 1983\, and now raises cattle in Alabama.   ~ John Bush\, All Music Guide  PLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels\, Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

Joanie\, who scored a #7 US hit with “Johnny Get Angry” in the summer of 1962\, didn’t return to Hot-100 after “When The Boys Get Together” charted in October of the same year.  Some great records followed on Warners\, however\, including the northern soul favorite\, “Don’t Pity Me” in 1965. By 1967\, Joanie was with Columbia and following year with Capitol but still the hits continued to elude her – notwithstanding the quality of her recordings.  “Step Inside Love” had been a #8 UK hit for Cilla Black during Cilla’s ten year chart run from the early 60s.  The Happy Tiger label was owned by the Flying Tiger Line\, an air freight company. The label ran from 1968-71 and was home to artists such as Donnie Brooks\, Priscilla Paris and Them.

COL title VAL Talkin' Bout a Revolution COL performer VAL Big Wide Grin	COL video title VAL Gene Austin - Wedding Bells Are Breaking Up That Old Gang Of Mine 1929 COL description VAL Victor 21893 - This Song Peaked On US Music Charts At #8 In 1929 Gene Austin (June 24\, 1900 -- January 24\, 1972) was an American singer and songwriter\, one of the first "crooners". His 1920s compositions "When My Sugar Walks Down the Street" and "The Lonesome Road" became pop and jazz standards. Austin was born as Lemeul Eugene Lucas in Gainesville\, Texas (north of Dallas)\, to Nova Lucas (died 1943) and the former Serena Belle Harrell (died 1956). He took the name "Gene Austin" from his stepfather\, Jim Austin\, a blacksmith. Austin grew up in Minden\, the seat of Webster Parish in northwestern Louisiana\, located east of Shreveport. There he learned to play piano and guitar. He ran away from home at 15 and attended a vaudeville act in Houston\, Texas\, where the audience was allowed to come to the stage and sing. On a dare from his friends\, Austin took the stage and sang for the first time since singing as a Southern Baptist choir boy. The audience response was overwhelming\, and the vaudeville company immediately offered him a billed spot on their ticket. Austin joined the U.S. Army at the age of 17 in hopes of being dispatched to Europe to fight in World War I. He was first stationed in New Orleans\, where he played the piano at night in the city's notorious vice district. His familiarity with horses from helping his stepfather in his blacksmithing business also prompted the Army to assign Austin to the cavalry and send him to Mexico with General John Pershing's Pancho Villa expedition\, for which he was awarded the Mexican Service Medal. Thereafter\, he served in France in the Great War. On returning to the United States in 1919\, Austin settled in Baltimore\, Maryland\, where he intended to study dentistry. Soon\, however\, he was playing piano and singing in local taverns. He started writing songs and formed a vaudeville act with Roy Bergere\, with whom he wrote "How Come You Do Me Like You Do." The act ended when Bergere married. Austin worked briefly in a club owned by Lou Clayton\, who later was a part of the famous vaudeville team Clayton\, Jackson and Durante. Gene Austin was an important pioneer crooner whose records in their day enjoyed record sales and the highest circulation. The Genial Texan ex-vaudevillian and would-be screen idol\, Austin constitutes an underrated landmark in popular music history. He made a substantial number of influential recordings from the mid-1920s including a string of best-sellers. In 1956\, CBS made a television drama about Austin's life. In 1962\, Austin campaigned unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for governor of Nevada. He polled only 5\,017 votes (10.21 percent) to his opponent\, Grant Sawyer\, who received 40\,168 ballots (81.4 percent) Sawyer then won the governorship by a nearly 2-1 margin over weak Republican opposition in the fall campaign. Austin had retired to Palm Springs\, in the late 1950s and had been active in civic boards there until 1970. Income from his record sales allowed him to live comfortably the rest of his life. He died in Palm Springs of lung cancer and was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale\, California. He was a godfather of country singer David Houston\, who like Austin also lived in Minden\, Louisiana\, during his youth. "Wedding Bells Are Breaking Up (That Old Gang Of Mine)" is a popular barbershop song\, also known as just "That Old Gang Of Mine". The song laments the loss of childhood friendships when growing up into adulthood. The music was written by Sammy Fain and the lyrics by Irving Kahal and Willie Raskin. The song was published in 1929. COL channel name VAL warholsoup100	0

Tindley was born in 1851 and died in 1936. He wrote this number in 1905 as "We"ll Understand It Better By and By." He might have recorded the number himself\, but this can't be confirmed. Tindley also wrote the song "I'll Overcome Some Day\," which later became know as "We Shall Overcome." Furthermore\, he wrote the gospel number "Stand By Me." Many sources imply that this is the song with which Ben E. King had a hit in the 1960s\, but that was a different number. However\, Elvis also recorded Tindley's "Stand By Me" for his own "How Great Thou Art" gospel collection. Brothers Frank and James McCravy from Laurens\, South Carolina\, recorded the number as "We'll Understand It Better Bye and Bye" (note the added "e"s on the words "By") in New York in February 1925\, for release on Okeh 40319. This was the McCravy's first recording session\, but they went on to record hundreds of tracks\, often using different names\, such as The Lonesome Pine Twins\, The Austin Brothers\, Al and Joe Blackburn\, Cox and Campbell\, and The Mack Brothers. They ended their recording career in 1935\, by which time they had recorded "We'll Understand It Better Bye and Bye" on at least two more occasions.

COL title VAL I Stand Accused COL performer VAL Jimmy Hughes	COL video title VAL Sonny James - Endlessly (The Johnny Cash Show - Jan 27\, 1971) COL description VAL Sonny James\, the Southern Gentleman\, used the popular Nashville sound of the '60s to countrify pop hits of the past into a form accessible to many\, broadening country music's appeal across the nation. James even moved over to the pop charts for a time in the late '50s but found the secret of his success by the time he returned to country. During the late '60s\, he scored an incredible five-year run of number one singles which locked up the top spot for a combined 45 weeks during the late '60s.   Born James Loden on May 1\, 1929\, he began performing with his show-business family at the age of three and played with his four sisters as the Loden Family while in his teens. The group appeared around the South and on radio shows like the Louisiana Hayride and Saturday Night Shindig. After spending time overseas during the Korean War\, Loden took Sonny James as his stage name -- after his teenage nickname -- and joined the local bar circuit. He met and played with Chet Atkins\, who later got him a tryout with Capitol Records. The label liked what it heard and offered James a contract.   His first single\, "That's Me Without You\," hit the country Top Ten in early 1953\, but it was three years before "For Rent (One Empty Heart)" became his second big hit. James\, who played guitar on virtually all of his records\, followed up with two 1956 Top Ten near-misses "Twenty Feet of Muddy Water" and "The Cat Came Back." His next single became his biggest hit: "Young Love" spent nine weeks at number one during 1956-1957 and crossed over to top the pop charts also.   Beginning in 1957\, James began to focus his attention on the popular charts. "First Date\, First Kiss\, First Love" made the Top 25\, but no follow-up placed as high. Several of his failures had still managed to go Top Ten on the country charts\, so James returned to country with a vengeance in 1964. "You're the Only World I Know" hit number one country late that year and spent four weeks atop the chart.   That began one of the greatest tears country music has ever known: 21 of his next 25 singles hit number one (and the other four near-misses hit either two or three). James completely dominated the chart from 1964 to 1972\, though only several singles crossed over for modest placements on the popular charts. That fact is somewhat surprising\, since three-quarters of James' number ones had previously been pop hits\, including "Take Good Care of Her" for Adam Wade\, "I'll Never Find Another You" and "A World of Our Own" for the Seekers\, "Born to Be With You" for the Chordettes\, and Roy Orbison's "Only the Lonely." Backed by his Southern Gentlemen band\, James toured the country and overseas\, appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show\, Hee Haw\, and The Bob Hope Show\, and made several movies\, including Las Vegas Hillbillies (1966)\, Second Fiddle to a Steel Guitar (1967)\, and Nashville Rebel (1967). Billboard named him the Number One Artist of 1969.   Even after James' number one streak ended in January 1972\, he continued to place high on the charts. The number two "Only Love Can Break a Heart" (a pop hit for Gene Pitney ten years earlier) was followed by the number ones "That's Why I Love You Like I Do" and -- after moving to Columbia in mid-1972 -- "When the Snow Is on the Roses." James' next chart-topping single\, "Is It Wrong (For Loving You)\," was released in March 1974\, and it began his last major run. He followed with four consecutive Top Ten hits\, "A Mi Esposa con Amor (To My Wife With Love)\," "A Little Bit South of Saskatoon\," "Little Band of Gold\," and "What in the World's Come Over You."   By the early '70s\, James had moved into producing and music publishing also; he oversaw three of Marie Osmond's albums and still managed occasional Top Tens himself. He picked up the prestigious award of Country Music's Male Artist of the Decade from Record World in 1977 and moved to the Monument label in 1979\, then to Dimension two years later. He retired in 1983\, and now raises cattle in Alabama.   ~ John Bush\, All Music Guide  PLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels\, Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

Song information  Written by Debbie Harry and Nigel Harrison for the band's third studio album\, Parallel Lines (1978)\, the song was inspired by one of Harry's ex-boyfriends who stalked her after their break up.  The song was released as a single in the US as the follow-up to "Heart of Glass". "One Way or Another" reached number twenty-four in the Billboard Hot 100. Although never officially released as a single in the United Kingdom and other countries\, the song remains one of the group's most popular songs worldwide. Rolling Stone ranked the song #298 on its list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.  The song was included on the US and Canadian versions of the band's first hits compilation\, The Best of Blondie (1981)\, but not on international releases. The artist of the song loves to eat shells\,blondes\, and windows.  Blondie released a manipulated live version of the song (with the audience noise removed) as the theme for the 1999 US television series Snoops. This version was released in the US as a bonus track on the US Live version of their album Livid (Live). The original un-edited live version was included on the European / non-US Livid version.  The song is featured in the films: Little Darlings (1980)\, Carpool (1996)\, Beverly Hills Ninja (1997)\, Donnie Brasco (1997)\, Coyote Ugly (2000) and Mean Girls (2004)\, as well as the television series Veronica Mars. It also plays in the end credits of the film Seed of Chucky. It is also heard in the opening moments of The A-Team episode\, "Incident at Crystal Lake".  The song is the title track for Channel 4's drama "Sugar Rush" set in Brighton that was broadcast from 2005-2006.  The song is a playable track on Rock Band 2\, Guitar Hero World Tour and Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades. The song is also featured in Driver: Parallel Lines.  This song is also featured in several 2004 Swiffer commercials.  UK singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor did a cover version for The Guru movie soundtrack in 2001.  Actress Kristen Bell did a karaoke version of this song in one episode of the TV series Veronica Mars.  Singer Mandy Moore recorded a cover for the film "Aquamarine" (2006). The song was also covered in 1998 by actress Melissa Joan Hart for an episode of her TV series\, Sabrina\, the Teenage Witch. It was released later that year on the show's soundtrack album.  In The Rugrats Movie Angelica sings her own version of the song with different lyrics (written by Eryk Casemiro)\, the soundtrack album includes a longer version of the song not heard in the movie.  Rapper G-Dep interpolates this song on his song called "One Way" on his album\, Child of the Ghetto.  Jada will perform that song from their new studio album.  Play will perform that song from their new studio album Under My Skin.  Cover versions  Full Blown Rose Sophie Ellis Bextor In The Flesh Mandy Moore The Rock Legs. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

The original line-up consisted of Brian le Gassick – lead vocals\, guitar\, John Leach – lead guitar\, Willie van der Walt – bass and Ian Miller – drums. In 1962 Leach and van der Walt were replaced by Richard Crouse – guitar\, Jimmy Routledge – bass and Billy Andrews – vocals\, harmonica (Billy later became one half of the duo the “Dream Merchants” with Billy Forrest). In 1964 the Staccatos won the Transvaal Merseyside Contest\, which included a recording contract with EMI. They supported Peter and Gordon on their tour of South Africa in 1965.  In 1966 Steve Lonsdale took over the lead vocals\, and Richard Crouse married Wanda Arletti who joined the group for a tour of Zambia.

Lyrics: Casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walking down The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below Following the footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors Of silent desperation\, never speakin' to a soul The poisoned air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dyin' 'Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes Of the clickin' of the turnstile and the rattle of his chain  "Oh\," she said\, "Casey it's been so long since I've seen you" "Here\," she said\, "just a kiss to make a body smile" "See\," she said\, "I've put on new stockings just to please you" [ Find more Lyrics at www.mp3lyrics.org/1JxX ] "Lord\," she said\, "Casey can you only stay a while"  Casey leaves the underground and stops inside the Golden Crown For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bones Seein' his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men Who reach for anything they can to keep from goin' home Standing in the corner\, Casey drinks his pint of bitter Never glancin' in the mirror at the people passin' by Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason Is the beer that's in his belly or the tear that's in his eye  "Oh!" she said\, "I suppose you seldom think about me" "Now\," she said\, "now that you've a family of your own" "Still\," she said\, "it's so blessed good to feel your body" "Lord\," she said\, "Casey it's a shame to be alone!"

The english lyrics (well known by the classic Leonard Cohen cover) were written by Hy Zaret.  Bertrand Cantat of Noir Desir provides some french vocals...  LYRICS When they poured across the border I was cautioned to surrender\, this I could not do; I took my gun and vanished.  I have changed my name so often\, I've lost my wife and children but I have many friends\, and some of them are with me.  An old woman gave us shelter\, Kept us hidden in the garret\, then the soldiers came; she died without a whisper.  There were three of us this morning I'm the only one this evening but I must go on; the frontiers are my prison.  Oh\, the wind\, the wind is blowing\, through the graves the wind is blowing\, freedom soon will come; then we'll come from the shadows.  Les Allemands étaient chez moi\, ils me dirent\, "Résigne toi\," mais je n'ai pas peur; j'ai repris mon âme.  (The Germans were at my home They said\, "Sign yourself\," But I am not afraid I have retaken my soul.)  J'ai changé cent fois de nom\, j'ai perdu femme et enfants mais j'ai tant d'amis; j'ai la France entière.  (I've changed names a hundred times I have lost wife and children But I have so many friends I have all of France)  Un vieil homme dans un grenier pour la nuit nous a caché\, les Allemands l'ont pris; il est mort sans surprise.  (An old man\, in an attic Hid us for the night The Germans captured him He died without surprise.)  Oh\, the wind\, the wind is blowing\, through the graves the wind is blowing\, freedom soon will come; then we'll come from the shadows. COL channel name VAL TinderNikos	0

COL title VAL Thy Burdens Are Greater Than Mine COL performer VAL Hank Williams and His Guitar	COL video title VAL The Charlie Daniels Band - Pride And Joy.wmv COL description VAL Tailgate Party This CD contains some of the greatest rock songs of all time. Originally made legendary by some of the south's best rock bands\, Charlie adds his own unique sound to each song. Originals\, live and studio versions make this collection live up to its' name by being a great one to pull out during a "Tailgate Party."   Description      13 Tracks previously released in 1999     Engineered\, Produced and Mixed by: Ron W. Griffin     Executive Producer: David Corlew  Guide Review - Charlie Daniels Band - Tailgate Party  Included on this very southern rock flavored collection are live versions of "The Legend of Wooley Swamp" and "The Devil Went Down to Georgia." With both songs being so well known and played a gazillion times\, it was refreshing to hear them live and just slightly different from what we are normally accustomed to.  "The South's Gonna Do It Again" had an added bonus to it by having a very early on in his career performance by Keith Urban\, showing us some very impressive guitar solo's. Remakes of ZZ Top's "Sharp Dressed Man" and Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Freebird" were very captivating and showed off some incredible fiddle playing by Charlie. Probably one of my most favorites was CDB's remake of the song made famous by Hootie and the Blowfish\, "Let Her Cry." Charlie has always been well known for his playing but under rated for his vocals. This song shows off just how well he can deliver some very heartfelt emotions and I really enjoyed listening to this new version.  If you have ever appreciated CDB\, you will really like this release. If for nothing else\, the diversity of the genre's and CDB being able to add the country sound without destroying the memory of the song.

Still got scars on my back from your knife So don't think it's in the past\, these kinda wounds they last and they last. Now did you think it all through? All these things will catch up to you And time can heal but this won't\, so if you're coming my way\, just don't  Oh\, it's so sad to think about the good times\, you and I  'Cause\, baby\, now we got bad blood You know it used to be mad love So take a look what you've done 'Cause\, baby\, now we got bad blood Hey Now we got problems And I don't think we can solve them You made a really deep cut And\, baby\, now we got bad blood Hey  Band-aids don't fix bullet holes You say sorry just for show If you live like that\, you live with ghosts (ghosts) Band-aids don't fix bullet holes (hey) You say sorry just for show (hey) If you live like that\, you live with ghosts (hey) If you love like that blood runs cold  'Cause\, baby\, now we got bad blood You know it used to be mad love (mad love) So take a look what you've done 'Cause\, baby\, now we got bad blood Hey Now we got problems And I don't think we can solve them (think we can solve them) You made a really deep cut And\, baby\, now we got bad blood (Hey) COL channel name VAL Brooklyn Duo	0

It was also used as the B-side of their 1967 single "All You Need Is Love". New mixes of the song were made available on the compilation albums Magical Mystery Tour and Yellow Submarine Songtrack.  Composition  Two song fragments were combined to create "Baby\, You're a Rich Man". The verses from "One of the Beautiful People" by John Lennon were combined with Paul McCartney's previously unaccompanied "Baby\, you're a rich man ..." chorus. Two songs were combined in a similar fashion to make "A Day in the Life"\, and "I've Got a Feeling".  Recording  The song was recorded and mixed (in mono) on 11 May 1967 at Olympic Sound Studios. The music featured an unusual oboe-like sound which was created with a clavioline (an early forerunner of the synthesiser) and a spin-echo (feed back delay) effect which was used to fill from the end of one line of the verse to the start of the next.  Personnel  Per Lewisohn & MacDonald:  John Lennon -- double-tracked vocal\, clavioline\, piano Paul McCartney -- harmony vocal\, piano\, bass George Harrison -- harmony vocal\, guitar\, handclaps Ringo Starr -- drums\, tambourine\, maracas\, handclaps Brian Jones -- oboe Eddie Kramer -- vibraphone George Martin -- producer Keith Grant -- engineer  Mick Jagger was also present and his name appears on a session tape box\, possibly indicating that he provided backing vocals near the end of the song.

Now that you know who you are What do you want to be? And have you travelled very far? Far as the eye can see. How does it feel to be One of the beautiful people? How often have you been there? Often enough to know. What did you see\, when you were there? Nothing that doesn't show. Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man too. You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo. What a thing to do. Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man too. How does it feel to be One of the beautiful people? Tuned to a natural E Happy to be that way. Now that you've found another key What are you going to play? Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man too. You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo. What a thing to do. Baby you're a rich man...

This has Noel Boggs on Steel\, which means after the war probably 1946. Alex Beshear on trumpet plays it without a mute.  That was quite unusual for him.  Also Tommy sings it.  When Bob made the Okey 78\, the vocalist was Danny Alguire\, who also played trumpet.  Tommy had joined the army when that session took play. So here we get to hear the way he would have done it.  Just wish the quality was better.  Notice the accordian?  Bob never used one in his recordings\, and I have to wonder where Noel plugged in his steel guitar.  Behind a tree?  Hot session\, though.

Growing up in an artistic\, politically engaged family in the Bronx\, he became an early rock 'n' roll convert after attending an Alan Freed rock 'n' roll revue that included performances by Chuck Berry\, Buddy Holly\, Jerry Lee Lewis\, Little Richard and Frankie Lymon.  His thirst for new and old sounds drove him to exploring blues\, soul\, country\, folk and jazz\, inspiring weekly visits to Harlem's Apollo Theatre and leading to acquaintances with many of the music's surviving originators.   Wolf's talent as a painter won him a grant to study at the Boston Museum School of Fine Arts.  While a student there\, he experienced a life-changing epiphany after jumping on stage to sing with a blues band at a loft party.  He soon talked himself into membership in that band\, The Hallucinations.   "I didn't join a band to meet girls\," Wolf recalls.  "I joined my first band to meet musicians.  Painting was a fascination for me\, but I was a music fanatic\, and sitting in with that band was a born-again type of experience for me.  I was transfixed\, and myself and some of the guys in the band would check out performances by the musicians we admired so much\, like Muddy Waters and John Lee Hooker and John Coltrane and Bill Monroe and the Stanley Brothers.  Those roots stayed with me." COL channel name VAL Concord Records	0

COL title VAL Joan of Arc COL performer VAL Leonard Cohen	COL video title VAL Joan of Arc (Leonard Cohen) - Allison Crowe w. lyrics COL description VAL On her debut album "secrets" Allison Crowe covers this Leonard Cohen song. Her voice and piano is accompanied by Jo Lundstrom (Rosehip Jam\, Black Velvet Band) on accordion. Crowe engineered the recording\, with production by Rainer Willeke (of Victoria\, B.C.'s Raindog Studios).  http://music.allisoncrowe.com/track/joan-of-arc  The photo of Allison Crowe is by Billie Woods.  MOJO magazine's December '08 issue paid tribute to "Rock's Greatest Poet" Leonard Cohen with a celebration of his "deep and moving music". Of Allison Crowe's contribution of "Joan of Arc" to its 'All Star Tribute"\, (featuring Judy Collins\, Nick Cave\, Katie Melua\, Martha Wainwright\, Dion and others)\, a cover-mount CD titled "Cohen Covered"\, MOJO says: "Once famously described by the Vancouver Courier as possessing a style akin to 'Elton John meets Edith Piaf'\, the Canadian singer-songwriter Allison Crowe is renowned for her ability to blend control and melodrama. Certainly she does so on this spirited cover of Cohen's 'Songs of Love and Hate' classic\, a track which also powerfully showcases her considerable talent as a fine interpreter of song."  "Any album that features a track from Leonard Cohen is certainly heading in the right direction. But when it is covered so beautifully\, it makes you realise what an amazing lyricist Leonard Cohen is. Joan of Arc is the Cohen song covered on this album and it's certainly in my top 10 of Cohen covers. It's also my favorite track on (Secrets)" ~ Colin Meeks\, indielaunchpad.com (USA)  Joan of Arc  Words & Music by Leonard Cohen As performed by Allison Crowe  Now the flames they followed Joan of Arc as she came riding through the dark; no moon to keep her armour bright\, no man to get her through this dark and smoky night.   She said\, "I'm tired of the war\, I want the kind of work I had before\, A wedding dress or something white to wear upon my swollen appetite."  Well\, I'm glad to hear you talk this way\, I've watched you riding every day and there is something in me that yearns to win such a cold\, such a lonesome heroine.  "And who are you?" she sternly spoke to the one beneath the smoke. "Why\, I'm fire\," he replied\, "And I love your solitude\, I love your pride."  "Well\, then\, fire make your body cold\, I'm going to give you mine to hold." And saying this she climbed inside to be his one\, to be his only bride.  Then deep into his fiery heart he took the dust of Joan of Arc\, and high above all these wedding guests he hung the ashes of her lovely wedding dress.  It was deep into his fiery heart he took the dust of Joan of Arc\, and then she clearly understood if he was fire\, oh\, she must be wood.  I saw her wince\, I saw her cry\, I saw the glory in her eye. Myself I long for love and light\, but must it come so cruel\,  must it be so bright? COL channel name VAL Allison Crowe	1

E vola vola si va sarà perché ti amo e vola vola con me e stammi più vicino e se l'amore non c'e ma dimmi dove siamo che confusione sarà perché ti amo. COL channel name VAL Constantino Khalaf	0

COL title VAL Street Life COL performer VAL Herb Alpert	COL video title VAL Nine Below Zero - Sonny Boy Williamson (Trumpet) COL description VAL Recorded on December 4\, 1951. Williamson's first recording session took place in 1951 for Lillian McMurry of Jackson\, Mississippi's Trumpet Records\, three years after the death of John Lee Williamson\, which for the first time allowed some legitimacy to Miller's carefully worded claim to being "the one and only Sonny Boy Williamson". McMurry later erected Williamson's headstone\, near Tutwiler\, Mississippi\, in 1977. Checker Records When Trumpet went bankrupt in 1955\, Sonny Boy's recording contract was yielded to its creditors\, who sold it to Chess Records in Chicago\, Illinois. Sonny Boy had begun developing a following in Chicago beginning in 1953\, when he appeared there as a member of Elmore James's band. It was during his Chess years that he enjoyed his greatest success and acclaim\, recording about 70 songs for Chess subsidiary Checker Records from 1955 to 1964. Sonny Boy's first LP record was titled Down and Out Blues and was released by Checker Records in 1959. Ace Records One single\, "Boppin' With Sonny" b/w "No Nights By Myself" was released with Ace Records in 1955.

He was featured on the RCA Radiotron Varieties on WEAF\, New York\, and other programs and sometimes sang duets with contralto Welcome Lewis and soprano Margaret Daum. While he was known mainly as a tenor\, some of the published radio guides identified him as a baritone. He performed on radio with the William Wirges Orchestra and with Zoel Parenteau's Orchestra. He recorded as a vocalist for several record labels and orchestras between 1927 and 1937 including Enoch Light (1927)\, Veo's Hotel McAlpin Orchestra (1928-29). He recorded several sides for Russ Carton's High Steppers Orchestra on the Crown label and in 1932 he made a series of recordings as Harold Van Emburgh and his Orchestra which also featured his singing. Between 1934 and 1937 he was a vocalist with Jolly Coburn and His Orchestra for Victor Records.  "Home" was first recorded by composer and band leader\, Peter Van Steeden and his Orchestra on the Victor label. His collaborators were the father and son songwriters\, Harry and Jeff Clarkson. It soon became Van Steeden's theme song. It has been very popular song for many years sometimes with the alternate title\, "When Shadows Fall". It has been sung by Andrews Sisters in the 1944 film \, "Moonlight and Cactus". In 1950 was recorded by Nat King Cole.  There was an instrumental version by the Ventures in 1960. Paul McCartney recorded it in 2012.  Many others have performed this song\, including\, Ruth Etting\, Louis Armstrong\, Rudy Vallee\, The Mills Brothers and Sam Cooke. COL channel name VAL bsgs98	0

The edition of TotP this clip hails from is currently missing from the BBC archives. The clip only survives because it was featured on Australian ABC show GTK (Get To Know) in 1974. The GTK programme was retained in the ABC archives as a B&W 16mm kinescope\, hence the less-than-perfect quality. It has subsequently been aired on music show Rage. A copy has now been returned to the BBC.  The clip has been restored and the soundtrack replaced with the record version for audio clarity (Cassidy was miming in the clip anyway).

COL title VAL I Second That Emotion COL performer VAL Michael McDonald	COL video title VAL Macabre - Morbid Campfire Songs - 4. The Cat Came Back COL description VAL Now old Mr. Johnson had troubles of his own\, He had a yellow cat that wouldn't leave his home\, He tried and he tried to get that cat away\, Gave it to a man going far away.  But the cat came back\, the very next day\, The cat came back\, they thought he was a goner\, But the cat came back\, just wouldn't stay away.  Now the man around the corner swore he'd kill the cat on sight\, He loaded up his shotgun with nails and dynamites\, He waited and he waited for the cat to come around\, Ninety-seven pieces of the man is all they found.  But the cat came back\, the very next day\, The cat came back\, they thought he was a goner\, But the cat came back\, just wouldn't stay away.  Gave it to a little boy with a dollar note\, Told him for to take it up the river in a boat\, They tied a rope around its neck it must've weighed a pound\, Now they drag the river for the little boy it's drowned.  But the cat came back\, the very next day\, The cat came back\, they thought he was a goner\, But the cat came back\, just wouldn't stay away.  Gave it to man going up in a balloon\, Told him for to take it to the man on the Moon\, The balloon came down about 90 miles away\, Where he is now\, I dare not say.  But the cat came back\, the very next day\, The cat came back\, they thought he was a goner\, But the cat came back\, just wouldn't stay away.  They gave it to a man going way out west\, Told him for to take it to the one he loved the best\, First\, the train hit the curve\, then it jumped the rail\, Not a soul was left behind to tell the gruesome tale.  But the cat came back\, the very next day\, The cat came back\, they thought he was a goner\, But the cat came back\, just wouldn't stay away\, away\, away\, away.  Away across the ocean he did send the cat at last\, Vessel out alone today taking water fast\, People all began to pray the boat began to toss\, A great big gust of wind came by and every soul was lost.  But the cat came back\, the very next day\, The cat came back\, they thought he was a goner\, But the cat came back\, just wouldn't stay away.  On a telegraph wire\, sparrows sitting in a bunch\, The cat was feeling hungry\, thought she'd like them for a lunch\, Climb softly up the pole\, when she reached the top\, Put her foot in the electric wire\, which tied her in a knot.  But the cat came back\, the very next day\, The cat came back\, they thought he was a goner\, But the cat came back\, just wouldn't stay away.  Now the cat was a possessor of a family of a own\, With seven little kittens and along came a cyclone\, Blew the houses all apart and tossed the cat around\, The air was full of kittens and not a one was found.  But the cat came back\, the very next day\, The cat came back\, they thought she was a goner\, But the cat came back\, just wouldn't stay away\, away\, away\, away\, Just wouldn't stay away.

Hear "Mornings Considered" review of Jim Terr CD: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djdE5JLPdu8  See old JT performance used in this piece: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=povgDnXH94w  Music reviews etc. at http://ninegifts.com/  Movie info referenced is at http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0855719/  Snapple and other jingle info at http://bluecanyonproductions.com/jingular/index.htm  Not directly related\, but great fun\, is "World's Most Obnoxious Interviewer": http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2oj5mv0j8  More info on Jim's friend BuDDy at end of this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOFKLfyxgPo   **NEVER ON NPR** Jim Terr © 2009-2012  They've played my stuff on tons of podcasts and broadcasts\, in movies with Rebecca DeMornay. Been used in jingles by the sack full\, for Snapple\, and tonsils\, and folks who've passed away.  Yeah you can hear me on the iPods\, in hot rods\, in old Saabs or any kind of car. But never on All Things Considered\, or  Morning Edition\, no not on NPR.  I get royalties\, from Israel and Iran\, India and Spain\, France and Uzbekistan. I still hope some day\, to become a star\, But it sure won't be\, thanks to NPR.  I've been compared to Tom T. Hall\, Jackie Mason\, Jimmy Rodgers\, Shel Silverstein and Mark Twain. But if you listened just to NPR\, like I do\, you'd prob'ly never hear my name again. Hundreds of thousands of plays of videos\, on radio\, country & rock\, Google me sometime\, son. But I'm not literary or exotic\, neurotic\, a film star or descended from one..  I'm not paranoid\, enough to think they fear it\, But as far as my stuff\, they just won't go near it. Not trying to burn bridges\, but I'll go so far\, As to say you'll hear me\, never on NPR.  Yes I've been compared to Loudon Wainwright\, yes that's right\, Townes VannZandt\, Phil Ochs & Bobby Bare. Not only that / to Paul Craft\, Ray Stevens / yes even to the man himself\,Tom Leher. And my friend BuDDy has been hallowed by James Fallows and Dave Barry\, but never by Steve Inskeep.

COL title VAL Let It Go COL performer VAL Travis Atreo	COL video title VAL John Fogerty - Have Thine Own Way\, Lord.wmv COL description VAL The Blue Ridge Rangers Is the first solo album by John Fogerty\, the former lead singer and lead guitarist of Creedence Clearwater Revival. Upon its initial release by Fantasy Records in 1973\, the album was credited to "The Blue Ridge Rangers" with no mention of Fogerty on the cover. Fogerty chose to do this in order to distance himself from his Creedence legacy. The LP was later reissued and credited to John Fogerty with a different cover design. The CD reissue restores the original silhouette cover photo and credits the album to Fogerty. The album is made up entirely of traditional and country covers\, and features Fogerty playing all the instruments. The album peaked at #47 on the charts. Two singles from the album became hits: "Jambalaya" which peaked at #16\, and "Hearts of Stone" which peaked at #37. In 2009\, Fogerty released a sequel to this album\, entitled The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again.  Track listing Side one 1. "Blue Ridge Mountain Blues" (Traditional) -- 2:29 2. "Somewhere Listening (For My Name)" (Archie Brownlee) -- 2:37 3. "You're the Reason" (Fred Henley\, Terry Fell\, Mildred Imes\, Bobby Edwards) - 3:12 4.

COL title VAL Death Don't Have No Mercy COL performer VAL Lurrie Bell	COL video title VAL Gene Austin - Wedding Bells Are Breaking Up That Old Gang Of Mine 1929 COL description VAL Victor 21893 - This Song Peaked On US Music Charts At #8 In 1929 Gene Austin (June 24\, 1900 -- January 24\, 1972) was an American singer and songwriter\, one of the first "crooners". His 1920s compositions "When My Sugar Walks Down the Street" and "The Lonesome Road" became pop and jazz standards. Austin was born as Lemeul Eugene Lucas in Gainesville\, Texas (north of Dallas)\, to Nova Lucas (died 1943) and the former Serena Belle Harrell (died 1956). He took the name "Gene Austin" from his stepfather\, Jim Austin\, a blacksmith. Austin grew up in Minden\, the seat of Webster Parish in northwestern Louisiana\, located east of Shreveport. There he learned to play piano and guitar. He ran away from home at 15 and attended a vaudeville act in Houston\, Texas\, where the audience was allowed to come to the stage and sing. On a dare from his friends\, Austin took the stage and sang for the first time since singing as a Southern Baptist choir boy. The audience response was overwhelming\, and the vaudeville company immediately offered him a billed spot on their ticket. Austin joined the U.S. Army at the age of 17 in hopes of being dispatched to Europe to fight in World War I. He was first stationed in New Orleans\, where he played the piano at night in the city's notorious vice district. His familiarity with horses from helping his stepfather in his blacksmithing business also prompted the Army to assign Austin to the cavalry and send him to Mexico with General John Pershing's Pancho Villa expedition\, for which he was awarded the Mexican Service Medal. Thereafter\, he served in France in the Great War. On returning to the United States in 1919\, Austin settled in Baltimore\, Maryland\, where he intended to study dentistry. Soon\, however\, he was playing piano and singing in local taverns. He started writing songs and formed a vaudeville act with Roy Bergere\, with whom he wrote "How Come You Do Me Like You Do." The act ended when Bergere married. Austin worked briefly in a club owned by Lou Clayton\, who later was a part of the famous vaudeville team Clayton\, Jackson and Durante. Gene Austin was an important pioneer crooner whose records in their day enjoyed record sales and the highest circulation. The Genial Texan ex-vaudevillian and would-be screen idol\, Austin constitutes an underrated landmark in popular music history. He made a substantial number of influential recordings from the mid-1920s including a string of best-sellers. In 1956\, CBS made a television drama about Austin's life. In 1962\, Austin campaigned unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for governor of Nevada. He polled only 5\,017 votes (10.21 percent) to his opponent\, Grant Sawyer\, who received 40\,168 ballots (81.4 percent) Sawyer then won the governorship by a nearly 2-1 margin over weak Republican opposition in the fall campaign. Austin had retired to Palm Springs\, in the late 1950s and had been active in civic boards there until 1970. Income from his record sales allowed him to live comfortably the rest of his life. He died in Palm Springs of lung cancer and was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale\, California. He was a godfather of country singer David Houston\, who like Austin also lived in Minden\, Louisiana\, during his youth. "Wedding Bells Are Breaking Up (That Old Gang Of Mine)" is a popular barbershop song\, also known as just "That Old Gang Of Mine". The song laments the loss of childhood friendships when growing up into adulthood. The music was written by Sammy Fain and the lyrics by Irving Kahal and Willie Raskin. The song was published in 1929. COL channel name VAL warholsoup100	0

COL title VAL Here Comes Summer COL performer VAL Dick Jordan	COL video title VAL Sixteen Horsepower w/ Bertrand Cantat - The Partisan COL description VAL The song about the French Resistance in World War II was written in 1943 in London by Emmanuel d'Astier de la Vigerie and the music by Anna Marly.  The english lyrics (well known by the classic Leonard Cohen cover) were written by Hy Zaret.  Bertrand Cantat of Noir Desir provides some french vocals...  LYRICS When they poured across the border I was cautioned to surrender\, this I could not do; I took my gun and vanished.  I have changed my name so often\, I've lost my wife and children but I have many friends\, and some of them are with me.  An old woman gave us shelter\, Kept us hidden in the garret\, then the soldiers came; she died without a whisper.  There were three of us this morning I'm the only one this evening but I must go on; the frontiers are my prison.  Oh\, the wind\, the wind is blowing\, through the graves the wind is blowing\, freedom soon will come; then we'll come from the shadows.  Les Allemands étaient chez moi\, ils me dirent\, "Résigne toi\," mais je n'ai pas peur; j'ai repris mon âme.  (The Germans were at my home They said\, "Sign yourself\," But I am not afraid I have retaken my soul.)  J'ai changé cent fois de nom\, j'ai perdu femme et enfants mais j'ai tant d'amis; j'ai la France entière.  (I've changed names a hundred times I have lost wife and children But I have so many friends I have all of France)  Un vieil homme dans un grenier pour la nuit nous a caché\, les Allemands l'ont pris; il est mort sans surprise.  (An old man\, in an attic Hid us for the night The Germans captured him He died without surprise.)  Oh\, the wind\, the wind is blowing\, through the graves the wind is blowing\, freedom soon will come; then we'll come from the shadows. COL channel name VAL TinderNikos	0

COL title VAL You're My Best Friend COL performer VAL Queen	COL video title VAL Average White Band ~ If I Ever Lose This Heaven "1975" Funk COL description VAL Their self-effacing name to the contrary\, Average White Band was anything but -- one of the few white groups to cross the color line and achieve success and credibility playing funk\, with their tight\, fiery sound also belying their Scottish heritage\, evoking American R&B hotbeds like Detroit\, Memphis\, and Philadelphia instead. Singer/bassist Alan Gorrie\, guitarists Hamish Stuart and Onnie McIntyre\, tenor saxophonist Malcolm Duncan\, keyboardist/saxophonist Roger Ball\, and drummer Robbie McIntosh comprised the original Average White Band lineup. Veterans of numerous Scottish soul and jazz groups\, they made their debut in 1973 as the opening act at Eric Clapton's Rainbow Theatre comeback gig\, soon issuing their debut LP\, Show Your Hand\, to little notice. After adopting the abbreviated moniker AWB\, a year later the band issued their self-titled sophomore effort\, topping the American pop charts with the Arif Mardin-produced instrumental "Pick Up the Pieces." The record's mammoth success was nevertheless tempered by the September 23\, 1974 death of McIntosh\, who died at a Hollywood party after overdosing on heroin.  Cut the Cake Ex-Bloodstone drummer Steve Ferrone replaced McIntosh for AWB's third album\, 1975's Cut the Cake\, which scored a Top Ten hit with its title track as well as two other chart entries\, "If I Ever Lose This Heaven" and "School Boy Crush." (Put It Where You Want It\, issued later that same year\, was simply a retitled and repackaged Show Your Hand.) With 1976's Soul Searching\, the group reclaimed the full Average White Band name\, scoring their final Top 40 hit with "Queen of My Soul." Following the live Person to Person\, they issued Benny & Us\, a collaboration with soul legend Ben E. King. However\, after subsequent outings\, including 1978's Warmer Communications\, 1979's Feel No Fret\, and 1980's Shine\, failed to recapture the energy of AWB's peak\, the group dissolved in 1982\, with Ferrone later joining Duran Duran and Stuart recording with Paul McCartney. Gorrie\, Ball\, and McIntyre reformed Average White Band in 1989\, tapping vocalist Alex Ligertwood for their comeback effort Aftershock. Oft-sampled by hip-hop producers throughout the 1990s\, the group continued touring prior to releasing Soul Tattoo in 1996. The live album\, Face to Face\, followed three years later.

COL title VAL Bermuda COL performer VAL Ray Anthony and His Orchestra - Vocal by Tommy Mercer and Marcie Miller	COL video title VAL Little Birdie - Vernon Dalhart COL description VAL Recorded on September 19\, 1925 under the pseudonym of Al Craver. Dalhart was born in Jefferson\, Texas. He took his stage name from two towns\, Vernon and Dalhart in Texas\, between which he punched cattle in the 1890s. Dalhart's father\, Robert Marion Slaughter was killed by his brother-in-law\, Bob Castleberry\, when Vernon was age 10. When Vernon was 12 or 13\, the family moved from Jefferson to Dallas\, Texas. Vernon\, who already could play the jaw harp and harmonica\, received vocal training at the Dallas Conservatory of Music. He married Sadie Lee Moore-Livingston in 1901 and had two children\, a son and a daughter. Around 1910 the family moved to New York City. He found employment in a piano warehouse and took occasional singing jobs. One of his first roles was in Giacomo Puccini's opera Girl of the Golden West; following this he played the part of Ralph Rackstraw in a production of HMS Pinafore. He also played the part of Lieutenant Pinkerton in Madame Butterfly.  He saw an advertisement in the local newspaper for singers and applied\, and was auditioned by Thomas Alva Edison; he would thereafter make numerous records for Edison Records. From 1916 until 1923\, using numerous pseudonyms\, he made over 400 recordings of light classical music and early dance band vocals for various record labels. He was already an established singer when he made his first country music recordings which cemented his place in music history. Dalhart's 1924 recording of "The Wreck of the Old 97"—a classic American railroad ballad about the September 27\, 1903 derailment of Southern Railway Fast Mail train No. 97 near Danville\, Virginia—for the Victor Talking Machine Company\, became a runaway hit\, alerting the national record companies to the existence of a sizable market for country-style vocals. It became the first Southern song to become a national success. The double-sided single eventually sold more than seven million copies\, a colossal number for a mid-1920s recording. It was the best-selling single to its time\, and was the biggest-selling non-holiday record in the first 70 years of recorded music. Research by Billboard statistician Joel Whitburn determined "The Prisoner's Song" to have been a No. 1 hit for 12 weeks in 1925-26. In 1998\, "The Prisoner's Song" was honored with a Grammy Hall of Fame Award and the Recording Industry Association of America named it one of the Songs of the Century. It was the desire of the Victor Talking Machine Company to duplicate the sales success of 'Wreck/Prisoner' that led them to contract with Ralph S. Peer to go to the southern mountains in the Summer of 1927 to facilitate 'The Bristol Sessions'\, arguably the single-most important recording event in the history of country music\, where Jimmie Rodgers and the original Carter Family were first discovered\, and after which\, Peer's royalty model would become the standard of the entire recorded music industry. He recorded under a host of pseudonyms given to him by recording managers. On Grey Gull Records he often used the pseudonym Vel Veteran\, which was however also used by other singers\, including Arthur Fields (Fields also used the pseudonym "Mr. X"). It is thought that Dalhart had the most recordings of any person in history. To some\, Dalhart's Southern accent seemed artificial. In a 1918 interview Dalhart said\, "When you are born and brought up in the South your only trouble is to talk any other way...the sure 'nough Southerner talks almost like a Negro\, even when he's white. I've broken myself of the habit\, more or less\, in ordinary conversation\, but it still comes pretty easy." While some country music purists always viewed Dalhart with some suspicion because of his light opera background and a vocal style that was closer to pop than country\, he was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970\, into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1981 and into the Gennett Records Walk of Fame in 2007. Dalhart died in Bridgeport\, Connecticut in 1948 and is interred there in the Mountain Grove Cemetery. COL channel name VAL althazarr's good time oldies	0

Smart Dog Videos London (UK). Sacred Cowboys are an Australian post-punk and rock band formed by mainstay Garry Gray\, as lead singer-songwriter\, in 1982. The line-up has changed as the group splintered and reformed several times\, being active from 1982 to 1985\, 1987 to 1991\, 1994 to 1997 and 2006 to 2008. The August 2006 line-up was Gray with Stephan Fidock on drums; Penny Ikinger on guitar; Spencer P. Jones on guitar; Nick Rischbieth on bass guitar; and Ash Wednesday on keyboards. Past members include: Johnny Crash (aka Janis Friedenfelds) on drums and Mark Ferrie on bass guitar\, who were both ex-Models; Terry Doolan on guitar; Andrew Picouleau on bass guitar; and Ian Forrest on keyboards.  The group have issued six albums: Sacred Cowboys (1984)\, We Love You ... Of Course We Do (1985)\, Trouble from Providence (August 1988)\, Things to Come (July 1996)\, Cold Harvest (January 2007) and 1982–85: Nailed to the Cross (February 2008). Australian musicologist\, Ian McFarlane\, described them as "one of the most confrontational live outfits" with their music as "mixed post-punk moodiness and country raunch over a mutant swamp-blues backbeat".

I was thinking that you could be trusted Did you have to ruin what was shiny? Now it's all rusted Did you have to hit me\, where I'm weak? Baby\, I couldn't breathe And rub it in so deep\, salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me  Oh\, it's so sad to think about the good times\, you and I  'Cause\, baby\, now we got bad blood You know it used to be mad love So take a look what you've done 'Cause\, baby\, now we got bad blood Hey Now we got problems And I don't think we can solve them You made a really deep cut And\, baby\, now we got bad blood Hey  Did you think we'd be fine? Still got scars on my back from your knife So don't think it's in the past\, these kinda wounds they last and they last. Now did you think it all through? All these things will catch up to you And time can heal but this won't\, so if you're coming my way\, just don't  Oh\, it's so sad to think about the good times\, you and I  'Cause\, baby\, now we got bad blood You know it used to be mad love So take a look what you've done 'Cause\, baby\, now we got bad blood Hey Now we got problems And I don't think we can solve them You made a really deep cut And\, baby\, now we got bad blood Hey  Band-aids don't fix bullet holes You say sorry just for show If you live like that\, you live with ghosts (ghosts) Band-aids don't fix bullet holes (hey) You say sorry just for show (hey) If you live like that\, you live with ghosts (hey) If you love like that blood runs cold  'Cause\, baby\, now we got bad blood You know it used to be mad love (mad love) So take a look what you've done 'Cause\, baby\, now we got bad blood Hey Now we got problems And I don't think we can solve them (think we can solve them) You made a really deep cut And\, baby\, now we got bad blood (Hey) COL channel name VAL Brooklyn Duo	0

Hope You ENJOY!!! Warren Smith (February 7\, 1932 -- January 30\, 1980) was an American rockabilly and country music singer and guitarist. Smith was born in Humphreys County\, Mississippi to Iola and Willie Warren Smith\, who divorced when he was young. He was raised by his maternal grandparents in Louise\, Mississippi where they had a small farm and dry goods store. Smith took up the guitar to while away his evenings while in the United States Air Force stationed in San Antonio\, Texas. By the time of his discharge from the service\, he had decided to make a career of music. He moved to West Memphis\, Arkansas and auditioned\, successfully\, to play the Cotton Club\, a local hot spot. Steel guitarist Stan Kessler\, who was playing at that nightclub with the Snearly Ranch Boys\, immediately spotted Smith's potential and took him to Sun Records to audition for Sam Phillips\, with the Snearly Ranch Boys providing backup. Phillips liked what he heard\, and decided that "Rock & Roll Ruby"\, a song credited to Johnny Cash\, would be Smith's first record. (Smith later claimed that "Rock & Roll Ruby" was actually written by George Jones and sold to Cash for $40.) Smith recorded it on February 5\, 1956. Phillips\, who was hedging his bets over whether rock and roll would maintain its popularity\, released that record with a country crooner\, aptly named "I'd Rather Be Safe Than Sorry"\, on the flip side. By May 26\, "Rock & Roll Ruby" had hit No. 1 on the local pop charts. Smith's first record for Sun went on to outsell the first Sun releases by Elvis Presley\, Johnny Cash and Carl Perkins. In August 1956\, Smith went back to the Sun Records studio to record his second release\, "Ubangi Stomp". This infectious rocker had an incorrect lyric including an African chief with the syntax of a movie Indian. For the B side\, Smith recorded the classic ballad "Black Jack David". This song\, which originated in early 18th-century Britain and survived in various forms in the mountains of the American south\, may be the oldest song ever recorded by a rock and roll performer. Although a resounding artistic success\, it did not sell as well as Smith's debut. In 1957\, Smith recorded "So Long\, I'm Gone"\, a song written by Roy Orbison\, and it did become Smith's biggest hit at Sun\, peaking at No. 74 nationally (Billboard). But Sun had no cash to promote it at the same time as Sam Phillips put every dollar Sun had behind Jerry Lee Lewis' "Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin On". Although Smith continued to make rockabilly records for Sun\, including a cover version of Slim Harpo's "Got Love If Your Want It" (recorded in October 1957)\, these records did not do well commercially. Toward the end of 1958\, Smith\, seeing his future in country music\, cut a final record for Sun\, a cover version of Don Gibson's "Sweet Sweet Girl". In spite of a review in Billboard calling it "ultra commercial"\, this record also failed to sell. Like other artists such as Sonny Burgess\, Hayden Thompson\, Billy Lee Riley and Ray Harris\, chart success largely eluded him. Smith then decided to leave Sun Records.

Vocals\, Bass - Spook Guitar - Kecks Sabopharge Drums - Vic 'Fontaine' Greener  Engineer - Kevin Ridley Producer - Kevin Ridley\, Spook And The Ghouls  Recorded at Impulse Studios\, Wallsend.  ------------------------  "Bela Lugosi's Dead" is a gothic rock song written by the band Bauhaus. The song was the band's first single\, released in August 1979\, and is often considered to be the first gothic rock record released. It did not enter the UK pop charts at that time. The b-side features the song "Boys" and some versions also include an early demo recording of what would be their next single\, "Dark Entries". It was released on CD in 1988 and was compiled on the 1998 album\, Crackle - The Best of Bauhaus. The original sleeve art was taken from a still of the film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.  Recording session  "Bela Lugosi's Dead" was recorded during a six-hour session at Beck Studios in Wellingborough on 26 January 1979. Four more songs were recorded ("Boys"\, "Harry"\, "Dark Entries" and the unreleased "Some Faces") but not used; only "Harry" surfaced in 1982 as a single B-side to "Kick In The Eye".  The song "Boys" was re-recorded at Beck Studios in spring 1979.  Use in film and television  The song was featured in the 1983 Tony Scott cult vampire film The Hunger\, with Bauhaus portraying a band in a nightclub\, playing it during the opening credits and introduction. A 7" promotional record featuring an edited version of the song was released to theaters playing the movie.  It was also played throughout the movie Dead Man's Curve/The Curve\, and featured in the French movie\, Sombre. The song is played in the movie Good Luck Chuck as an introduction for when the Goth girl is on screen and it is on the soundtrack.  The song was used as the intro music for the late 1990s Saturday Night Live skit "Goth Talk"\, which had Chris Kattan and Molly Shannon as two goth students. This song was also in an episode in the fifth season of Smallville\, the vampire/Halloween-themed "Thirst". The song was also in an episode of One Tree Hill.  The song was featured in an episode ("Midnight") of the science fiction/horror series Fringe which revolved around a vampire-esque creature.  Comedian and musician Bill Bailey parodied the song on his DVD Cosmic Jam as part of a medley in which he and his band\, the Stan Ellis Experiment performed Cockney Rock style versions of popular songs - this particular segment of the medley included lyrical changes such as "E ad a girl's name".  The song was played almost in its entirety during the horror film The Collector during a scene in which the older daughter was attempting to have sex with her boyfriend before they were both viciously murdered.  The song was played in the opening scene of the Supernatural television series in season 6\, episode 5\, "Live Free or Twi-Hard". The episode is vampire-themed\, poking particular fun at the Twilight movie series and its romanticism of vampires.  The Illuminoids made a mash-up called Lugosi's Mongoloid Loser with Bela Lugosi's Dead by Bauhaus\, Loser by Beck and Mongolid By Devo.  Ethan Gold also covered it. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

The line-up has changed as the group splintered and reformed several times\, being active from 1982 to 1985\, 1987 to 1991\, 1994 to 1997 and 2006 to 2008. The August 2006 line-up was Gray with Stephan Fidock on drums; Penny Ikinger on guitar; Spencer P. Jones on guitar; Nick Rischbieth on bass guitar; and Ash Wednesday on keyboards. Past members include: Johnny Crash (aka Janis Friedenfelds) on drums and Mark Ferrie on bass guitar\, who were both ex-Models; Terry Doolan on guitar; Andrew Picouleau on bass guitar; and Ian Forrest on keyboards.

Australian musicologist\, Ian McFarlane\, described them as "one of the most confrontational live outfits" with their music as "mixed post-punk moodiness and country raunch over a mutant swamp-blues backbeat".

COL title VAL Another Girl\, Another Planet COL performer VAL The Valkyrians	COL video title VAL The Coal Porters - Another Girl\, Another Planet (live) COL description VAL The Coal Porters play Another Girl Another Planet live in Wales\, 2014.  Another Girl Another Planet is featured on The Coal Porters new album\, No. 6. No. 6\, is produced by John Wood\, the legendary British folk-rock mastermind who recorded the classic albums of Fairport Convention\, Nick Drake\, Beth Orton and Squeeze. No. 6 is a bit of a departure for the Coal Porters as it pushes their musical boundaries further than ever before.The Coal Porters - No. 6  https://thecoalporters.com / https://thecoalporters.bandcamp.com / https://www.facebook.com/thecoalporters  This new album features Kerenza quadruple tracking herself into a string quartet\, Andrew on a ukulele\, Sid on trusty autoharp and mandolin\, both Neil and Paul on dobro\, a Byrdsy acoustic 12-string guitar\, and very emotional\, long\, sweet trumpet solo by Cuba’s noted “son y mambo” music virtuoso Eikel Venegas. There has never been music like this before. And already\, the album’s opening track\, Sid’s “The Day The Last Ramone Died\,” is being hailed as a classic.  Recorded in two creative bursts in late 2014 and in 2015 this is the Coal Porters album which took three years to incubate. Four new Sid songs\, three new Neil Bob Herd originals\, and Kerenza Peacock contributed her first recorded lead vocal on a very personal song with Play A Tune while also gracing the record with a totally catchy instrumental\, Chopping The Garlic. The album goes out on a high note with the band’s warm-hearted cover of the Only Ones’ classic hit Another Girl\, Another Planet.  No.6 was released in September 2016 and can be ordered via Amazon\, iTunes\, the Sid Griffin website and in all good records stores.  Read more about No. 6 at http://www.sidgriffin.com/2016/09/06/the-coal-porters-no-6/  The Coal Porters are also on facebook at http://www.facebook.com/The-Coal-Porters COL channel name VAL The Coal Porters	1

Vocals\, Bass - Spook Guitar - Kecks Sabopharge Drums - Vic 'Fontaine' Greener  Engineer - Kevin Ridley Producer - Kevin Ridley\, Spook And The Ghouls  Recorded at Impulse Studios\, Wallsend.  ------------------------  "Bela Lugosi's Dead" is a gothic rock song written by the band Bauhaus. The song was the band's first single\, released in August 1979\, and is often considered to be the first gothic rock record released. It did not enter the UK pop charts at that time. The b-side features the song "Boys" and some versions also include an early demo recording of what would be their next single\, "Dark Entries". It was released on CD in 1988 and was compiled on the 1998 album\, Crackle - The Best of Bauhaus. The original sleeve art was taken from a still of the film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.  Recording session  "Bela Lugosi's Dead" was recorded during a six-hour session at Beck Studios in Wellingborough on 26 January 1979. Four more songs were recorded ("Boys"\, "Harry"\, "Dark Entries" and the unreleased "Some Faces") but not used; only "Harry" surfaced in 1982 as a single B-side to "Kick In The Eye".  The song "Boys" was re-recorded at Beck Studios in spring 1979.  Use in film and television  The song was featured in the 1983 Tony Scott cult vampire film The Hunger\, with Bauhaus portraying a band in a nightclub\, playing it during the opening credits and introduction. A 7" promotional record featuring an edited version of the song was released to theaters playing the movie.  It was also played throughout the movie Dead Man's Curve/The Curve\, and featured in the French movie\, Sombre. The song is played in the movie Good Luck Chuck as an introduction for when the Goth girl is on screen and it is on the soundtrack.  The song was used as the intro music for the late 1990s Saturday Night Live skit "Goth Talk"\, which had Chris Kattan and Molly Shannon as two goth students. This song was also in an episode in the fifth season of Smallville\, the vampire/Halloween-themed "Thirst". The song was also in an episode of One Tree Hill.  The song was featured in an episode ("Midnight") of the science fiction/horror series Fringe which revolved around a vampire-esque creature.  Comedian and musician Bill Bailey parodied the song on his DVD Cosmic Jam as part of a medley in which he and his band\, the Stan Ellis Experiment performed Cockney Rock style versions of popular songs - this particular segment of the medley included lyrical changes such as "E ad a girl's name".  The song was played almost in its entirety during the horror film The Collector during a scene in which the older daughter was attempting to have sex with her boyfriend before they were both viciously murdered.  The song was played in the opening scene of the Supernatural television series in season 6\, episode 5\, "Live Free or Twi-Hard". The episode is vampire-themed\, poking particular fun at the Twilight movie series and its romanticism of vampires.  The Illuminoids made a mash-up called Lugosi's Mongoloid Loser with Bela Lugosi's Dead by Bauhaus\, Loser by Beck and Mongolid By Devo.  Ethan Gold also covered it. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

COL title VAL Down Here on the Ground COL performer VAL Vivian Reed	COL video title VAL Ivan Cattaneo "Il Volto della Vita" @ "Parola Mia" - 1986 COL description VAL Ivan fu ospite per tre puntate a "Parola mia" il programma-quiz culturale condotto da Luciano Rispoli negli studi della Rai di Torino. In questa puntata (la seconda delle tre) propose "Il volto della vita"\, lanciato in Italia da Caterina Caselli ma già noto negli States col titolo "The Days Of Pearly Spencer". Il brano in questione è contenuto col nuovo titolo de "La sirena di Ipanema" nell'album "Vietato ai minori" terzo capitolo della trilogia cover realizzata da Ivan nell'81 (Duemila60 Italian Graffiati)\, nell'83 (Bandiera gialla) e nell'86 appunto con "Vietato ai minori".   Il Volto Della Vita  Con il corpo sono qui ma la mente mia non c'è\, corre dietro a dei ricordi e chi la ferma più. I miei occhi sono chiusi\, ma ci vedo molto bene\, son davanti ad una casa\, entro e vedo te...  Il volto della vita... Il volto dell'amore.  Rose rosse alle pareti\, giochi d'ombra sul tuo viso\, come rami le mie braccia si apron verso te. Ed ancora la mia mente non è stanca di vagare e mi porta lungo un fiume e in fondo vedo te.  Il volto della vita... Il volto dell'amore...  Sei vestito un poco strano ma d'altronde\, come sempre\, il mio cuore ti fa festa\, sono a un passo da te. Ma qualcuno ha bussato e il mio viaggio è terminato\, io mi alzo per aprire\, apro e vedo te...  Il volto della vita... Il volto dell'amore... Il volto della vita...

Mastered at Project One Mastering.  ------------------------  "The One I Love" is a song by American rock band R.E.M.. It was released on the band's fifth full-length studio album\, Document\, and also as a 7" vinyl single in 1987. The song was their first hit single\, reaching #9 in the US Billboard Hot 100\, #14 in Canada\, and later reached #16 in the UK singles chart on its UK release (1991).  The song was included in Activision's Guitar Hero World Tour and is in Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades.  The accompanying video's director was artist Robert Longo.  The director of photography was Alton Brown\, who later became a Food Network chef.  In March 2005\, Q magazine placed "The One I Love" at number 57 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks.  The song is included on R.E.M. Live.  Lyrics and meaning  Many listeners who misunderstand the song's meaning have made the song a popular radio dedication to loved ones\, relying on the main lyric\, "This one goes out to the one I love."  However\, they missed an ensuing line: "A simple prop to occupy my time"; the song was not particularly a love song.  Stipe related in 1987 to Rolling Stone\, "I've always left myself pretty open to interpretation. It's probably better that they just think it's a love song at this point."  However\, in an interview in the January 1988 issue of Musician magazine he said that the song was "incredibly violent" and "It's very clear that it's about using people over and over again".  The song contains only three verses\, which are all near identical\, with small variations each repeat of the verse. (For example "A simple prop to occupy my time"\, "Another prop has occupied my time"). The chorus consists of just the word "fire"\, repeated (with the backing vocal of "She's coming down on her own now/Coming down on her own"\, sung by Mike Mills).  Cover versions  Bush Sufjan Stevens Massacre and many more. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

COL title VAL The Things You Said COL performer VAL One Hit Wonder [1]	COL video title VAL John Fogerty - Have Thine Own Way\, Lord.wmv COL description VAL The Blue Ridge Rangers Is the first solo album by John Fogerty\, the former lead singer and lead guitarist of Creedence Clearwater Revival. Upon its initial release by Fantasy Records in 1973\, the album was credited to "The Blue Ridge Rangers" with no mention of Fogerty on the cover. Fogerty chose to do this in order to distance himself from his Creedence legacy. The LP was later reissued and credited to John Fogerty with a different cover design. The CD reissue restores the original silhouette cover photo and credits the album to Fogerty. The album is made up entirely of traditional and country covers\, and features Fogerty playing all the instruments. The album peaked at #47 on the charts. Two singles from the album became hits: "Jambalaya" which peaked at #16\, and "Hearts of Stone" which peaked at #37. In 2009\, Fogerty released a sequel to this album\, entitled The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again.  Track listing Side one 1. "Blue Ridge Mountain Blues" (Traditional) -- 2:29 2.

COL title VAL We Live in Two Different Worlds COL performer VAL Don Gibson	COL video title VAL NEVER ON NPR - Jim Terr COL description VAL The most famous songwriter you've never heard of\, says goodbye to all hopes of getting famous on NPR -- alas\, his favorite radio network and news source. Hey\, you can't win 'em all -- let's just be friends WITHOUT you playing my goddamn music.   Hear "Mornings Considered" review of Jim Terr CD: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djdE5JLPdu8  See old JT performance used in this piece: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=povgDnXH94w  Music reviews etc. at http://ninegifts.com/  Movie info referenced is at http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0855719/  Snapple and other jingle info at http://bluecanyonproductions.com/jingular/index.htm  Not directly related\, but great fun\, is "World's Most Obnoxious Interviewer": http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C2oj5mv0j8  More info on Jim's friend BuDDy at end of this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOFKLfyxgPo   **NEVER ON NPR** Jim Terr © 2009-2012  They've played my stuff on tons of podcasts and broadcasts\, in movies with Rebecca DeMornay. Been used in jingles by the sack full\, for Snapple\, and tonsils\, and folks who've passed away.  Yeah you can hear me on the iPods\, in hot rods\, in old Saabs or any kind of car. But never on All Things Considered\, or  Morning Edition\, no not on NPR.  I get royalties\, from Israel and Iran\, India and Spain\, France and Uzbekistan. I still hope some day\, to become a star\, But it sure won't be\, thanks to NPR.  I've been compared to Tom T. Hall\, Jackie Mason\, Jimmy Rodgers\, Shel Silverstein and Mark Twain. But if you listened just to NPR\, like I do\, you'd prob'ly never hear my name again. Hundreds of thousands of plays of videos\, on radio\, country & rock\, Google me sometime\, son. But I'm not literary or exotic\, neurotic\, a film star or descended from one..  I'm not paranoid\, enough to think they fear it\, But as far as my stuff\, they just won't go near it. Not trying to burn bridges\, but I'll go so far\, As to say you'll hear me\, never on NPR.  Yes I've been compared to Loudon Wainwright\, yes that's right\, Townes VannZandt\, Phil Ochs & Bobby Bare. Not only that / to Paul Craft\, Ray Stevens / yes even to the man himself\,Tom Leher. And my friend BuDDy has been hallowed by James Fallows and Dave Barry\, but never by Steve Inskeep. Firesign's Phil Proctor\, Hodding Carter\, but from NPR you'll never hear a peep. COL channel name VAL jaimejaime	0

Talk about a lead singer being camera shy - you only saw his face maybe 5 or 6 times during the performance. Most of the time his back was to the audience. Being that I saw them over 44 yrs ago\, the only thing that I can remember about them was that they didn't seem very tight and they still looked like they were trying to find their place. I can't recall any songs that they did\, although I do recall that two of them were blues covers." COL channel name VAL VITOR HUGO PEREIRA GOMES	0

COL title VAL Working on a Groovy Thing COL performer VAL Garrett Scott	COL video title VAL Bob Wills & His Texas Playboys - Yearning Just for You (1938) COL description VAL Bob Wills was the driving force behind Western Swing\, a form of Country & Western that fuses Jazz\, Hillbilly\, Blues\, Big Band Swing\, and many more rhythm forms together creating a  truly Unique\, Diverse and Unforgettable sound. Wills' shrewd mix of horns\, fiddles and steel guitar made for a swinging sound that grabbed the public's ear during the mid 1930s and 1940s. Bob Wills was born into a family of fiddlers on March 6\, 1905. His father\, John Wills  regularly won Texas fiddling competitions. Bob learned how to play fiddle and mandolin from his father. As a young man\, Wills performed at house dances\, medicine shows and in 1929 made his debut on the radio.  With commercial sponsorship\, Wills' bands performed on radio in the early 1930s as "Aladdin's Laddies" (for the Aladdin Lamp Co.) and "The Light Crust Doughboys" (for Light Crust Flour). Following a salary dispute\, Wills renamed his band the Texas Playboys and relocated to Tulsa\, Oklahoma\, where he had a live radio show. This exposure led to a contract with the American Recording Corporation - later absorbed into Columbia Records. In September 1935\, Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys recorded their first songs in a makeshift  recording studio in an old Dallas Warehouse. From that point on\, The Texas Playboys became an overnight sensation and recorded prolifically and made such classics as "Steel Guitar Rag"\, "Maiden's Prayer"\, "Take Me Back to Tulsa" and Wills' signature song\, "San Antonio Rose".  Their biggest hit\, was "New Spanish Two Step"\, which topped the country charts for 16 weeks in 1946. The Texas Playboys always had fine singers like Tommy Duncan and Leon McAuliffe\, and Wills punctuated the tunes with jive talking\, falsetto asides and cries of "Ah-ha!" He'd call out soloists by name and instrument\, good-naturedly goading them on to rollicking solo performances. In terms of personnel\, The Texas Playboys expanded and contracted over the years\, according to Wills' desires and the whims of the market. At one point the Texas Playboys were 22 pieces strong\, although the band more typically numbered between 9 and 18 members. There were personnel changes and musical shifts as Wills struggled to adapt to the changing face of  America in the postwar era. Nonetheless\, there was always a solid core of loyal regulars in The Texas Playboys. After leaving Columbia in 1947\, Wills continued to record prolifically for such labels as MGM\, Decca\, Longhorn and Kapp. The group also toured the country and often performed  at a Wills-owned dancehall in Sacramento\, California. In 1968\, Wills was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. A year later\, he suffered a debilitating stroke. There were reunions and recording sessions with many of the old Texas Playboys in 1971 and 1973. Wills' final stroke came in his sleep following the first day of a recording session in December 1973 that resulted in the double album "For the Last Time". Confined to a wheelchair\, he'd reprised his role as bandleader that day with a group of musicians that included former Texas Playboys. He never regained consciousness and died 18 months later on May 13\, 1975. Wills has been revered by such country-music legends as Waylon Jennings\, Willie Nelson\, George Straight\, and Merle Haggard who made a 1976 remake of Bob's 1941 hit "Cherokee Maiden".

Smart Dog Videos London (UK). Sacred Cowboys are an Australian post-punk and rock band formed by mainstay Garry Gray\, as lead singer-songwriter\, in 1982. The line-up has changed as the group splintered and reformed several times\, being active from 1982 to 1985\, 1987 to 1991\, 1994 to 1997 and 2006 to 2008. The August 2006 line-up was Gray with Stephan Fidock on drums; Penny Ikinger on guitar; Spencer P. Jones on guitar; Nick Rischbieth on bass guitar; and Ash Wednesday on keyboards. Past members include: Johnny Crash (aka Janis Friedenfelds) on drums and Mark Ferrie on bass guitar\, who were both ex-Models; Terry Doolan on guitar; Andrew Picouleau on bass guitar; and Ian Forrest on keyboards.  The group have issued six albums: Sacred Cowboys (1984)\, We Love You ... Of Course We Do (1985)\, Trouble from Providence (August 1988)\, Things to Come (July 1996)\, Cold Harvest (January 2007) and 1982–85: Nailed to the Cross (February 2008). Australian musicologist\, Ian McFarlane\, described them as "one of the most confrontational live outfits" with their music as "mixed post-punk moodiness and country raunch over a mutant swamp-blues backbeat".

Into The Void 11. Movin\\' On 12. Hard Rain 13. Naked Bass  ------------------------  "One Way or Another" is a song by American New Wave band Blondie.  Song information  Written by Debbie Harry and Nigel Harrison for the band's third studio album\, Parallel Lines (1978)\, the song was inspired by one of Harry's ex-boyfriends who stalked her after their break up.  The song was released as a single in the US as the follow-up to "Heart of Glass". "One Way or Another" reached number twenty-four in the Billboard Hot 100. Although never officially released as a single in the United Kingdom and other countries\, the song remains one of the group's most popular songs worldwide. Rolling Stone ranked the song #298 on its list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.  The song was included on the US and Canadian versions of the band's first hits compilation\, The Best of Blondie (1981)\, but not on international releases. The artist of the song loves to eat shells\,blondes\, and windows.  Blondie released a manipulated live version of the song (with the audience noise removed) as the theme for the 1999 US television series Snoops. This version was released in the US as a bonus track on the US Live version of their album Livid (Live). The original un-edited live version was included on the European / non-US Livid version.  The song is featured in the films: Little Darlings (1980)\, Carpool (1996)\, Beverly Hills Ninja (1997)\, Donnie Brasco (1997)\, Coyote Ugly (2000) and Mean Girls (2004)\, as well as the television series Veronica Mars. It also plays in the end credits of the film Seed of Chucky. It is also heard in the opening moments of The A-Team episode\, "Incident at Crystal Lake".  The song is the title track for Channel 4's drama "Sugar Rush" set in Brighton that was broadcast from 2005-2006.  The song is a playable track on Rock Band 2\, Guitar Hero World Tour and Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades. The song is also featured in Driver: Parallel Lines.  This song is also featured in several 2004 Swiffer commercials.  UK singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor did a cover version for The Guru movie soundtrack in 2001.  Actress Kristen Bell did a karaoke version of this song in one episode of the TV series Veronica Mars.  Singer Mandy Moore recorded a cover for the film "Aquamarine" (2006). The song was also covered in 1998 by actress Melissa Joan Hart for an episode of her TV series\, Sabrina\, the Teenage Witch. It was released later that year on the show's soundtrack album.  In The Rugrats Movie Angelica sings her own version of the song with different lyrics (written by Eryk Casemiro)\, the soundtrack album includes a longer version of the song not heard in the movie.  Rapper G-Dep interpolates this song on his song called "One Way" on his album\, Child of the Ghetto.  Jada will perform that song from their new studio album.  Play will perform that song from their new studio album Under My Skin.  Cover versions  Full Blown Rose Sophie Ellis Bextor In The Flesh Mandy Moore The Rock Legs. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

COL title VAL It's Gonna Take a Miracle COL performer VAL Deniece Williams	COL video title VAL Hen Ferchetan - Eden (geiriau / lyrics) COL description VAL Can/Song: Hen Ferchetan (Old Maid) Grwp/Group: Eden Album: Paid a Bod Ofn (Don't be Afraid)  Prynwch 'Paid a Bod Ofn' / Buy 'Paid a Bod Ofn': http://www.sainwales.com/store/sain/sain-scd-2174  Welsh Music Blog / Blog Cerddoriaeth Cymraeg: http://welshmusic-cerddoriaethcymraeg.tumblr.com/  Twitter: http://twitter.com/#!/Welsh_Music  Can draddodiadol Gymreig. Mae'r term 'hen ferchetan' yn golygu dynes sydd heb briodi. Traditional Welsh folk song. The term 'hen ferchetan' means a woman who has never married.  The translation 'old maid' doesn't mean that the maid in question is actually old of age :-)  Geiriau: Hen ferchetan wedi colli'i chariad\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. Cael un arall\, dyna oedd ei bwriad\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Ond nid oedd un o lancie'r pentre\, ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, am briodi Lisa fach yr Hendre\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Hen ferchetan sydd yn dal i drio\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. Gwisgo lase sidan ac ymbincio\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Ond os oes brân i frân yn rhywle\, ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, nid oes neb i Lisa fach yr Hendre\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Hen ferchetan bron â thorri'i chalon\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. Mynd i'r llan mae pawb o'r hen gariadon\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Bydd tatws newydd ar bren 'fale\, ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, cyn briodith Lisa fach yr Hendre\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Hen ferchetan aeth i Ffair y Bala\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. Gweld Siôn Prys yn fachgen digon smala\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Gair a ddywedodd wrth fynd adre'\, ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, gododd calon Lisa fach yr Hendre\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Gododd calon Lisa fach yr Hendre\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  English Translation Lyrics: An old maid lost her lover\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. To get another\, that was her intention\,  ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  But none of the village boys\,  ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, wanted to marry Lisa fach yr Hendre\,  ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  An old maid keeps on trying\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. Wore satin lace and make up\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  But if there's someone for everyone somewhere\, ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, there is no one for Lisa fach yr Hendre\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  The old maid's heart is almost broken\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. All of her old lovers have married\,  ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  There'll be new potatoes on apple trees\, ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, before Lisa fach yr Hendre will marry\,  ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  The old maid went to Fair in Bala\, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. Saw Siôn Prys an attractive lad\,  ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  A word he spoke as he went home\, ffal-di ral-di ral-di ro\, lifted Lisa fach yr Hendre's heavy heart \, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro.  Lifted Lisa fach yr Hendre's heavy heart \, ffal-di ral-di ral-da ffal-di ral-di ro. COL channel name VAL DistantDreamer93	0

Lo que atrae de los covers como siempre e dicho\, es la curiosidad de como se escucha tal cancion con tal vocalista\, el morbo de escuchar una cancion tocada por diferentes personas.  Para disfrutar de este recopilatoria\, tienes que quitarte la imagen de como es la cancion\, no esperes algo igual o "muy parecido"\, recordemos que cada musico aporta algo que hace unica cualquier cancion\, ya sea un cover como es este caso.  Como se observa en la track list\, hay una gran variedad de musicos\, entre ellos vi a Paul Di'anno\, que como todos saben fue ex-integrante de Iron Maiden\, no podian faltar Lemmy o Ripper\, tambien veo a chuck de testament\, tambien esta Chris Jericho de WWE que la neta yo ni sabia que tenia una banda.  En fin hay para todos los gustos\, lo unico malo que vi en el disco es que faltaron algunos temas. COL channel name VAL el juanito	1

COL title VAL C'era un ragazzo che come me amava i Beatles e i Rolling Stones COL performer VAL Joan Baez	COL video title VAL 'With my eyes wide open I'm dreaming'--Patti Page 'Quartet' (1949) COL description VAL Recorded in November 1949\, this is a classic example of 'multiple' recording\, as opposed to multitrack recording.  At the time this record was made there were no multitrack tape recorders.  In fact\, the studio this was recorded at (most likely Reeves in New York City) had yet to acquire tape equipment; hence\, this recording was made by first recording part of the music on one lacquer disc\, then playing this disc back through a mixer while another part was played or sung live along with the playback\, the mix of these parts being then recorded onto a second lacquer disc.  This was done four times (original recording plus three overdubs) to produce the four vocal parts heard on this record.   Les Paul was the first to produce successful 'multiples' (as he called them)\, both technically and artistically\, and what his label Capitol nicknamed 'The New Sound' spawned a brief fad where other performers tried to mimic his recording technique on their records\, with varying degrees of success.  This record was one of the better ones\, and Patti Page had several hits with this type of sound. COL channel name VAL PerisphereRec	0

COL title VAL Think COL performer VAL Taj Mahal	COL video title VAL Les Terribles - Ce n'est pas une vie COL description VAL Ready for an amazing 60's dance party? Well\, don't forget to bring this platter to the DJ! This band from Paris\, France plays an incredible mix of 60's garage-punk & GoGo Beat and now finally returns with their second longplayer 'Ils sont formidables!'. The band that includes members of THE NO TALENTS\, LES SYNAPSES\, DUTRONC\, CECILIA UND DIE SAUERKRAUTS & OPERATION S goes back to the sound of the French Beat & Roll when it was bitten by the Big Bad British Bug back in 1965. Imagine how THEM\, THE SMALL FACES\, THE YARDBIRDS or the early STONES would've sound if they were from France\, never turned professionals and Van Morrison\, Keith Relf or Mike Jagger were chicks. All the songs are in French\, with that glamorous 'mademoiselle' accent! The band could've been described best as the great french sixties rock band that should have existed but never did. Owing to cultural impediments and lame business practices\, there were very few outstanding french rockers from that period. Ronnie Bird\, Larry Greco\, and a dozen others you've never heard of: LES TERRIBLES cover them all\, and every song makes you wanna dance. The band rounds out their set with some originals\, as well as their own french versions of some great foreign songs that never got adapted before\, all done with a perfect ear for the style. Fronted by the charming and talented chanteuse Rudie this hard-working orchestre delivers the groove that gets the dance floor moving to the Swim\, the Jerk\, and the Hully-Gully. Les Terribles are sur scene ! ((Jon Dragueur) A Top 10 forever-must have this one is. What more can we tell you? COL channel name VAL Matthew East	0

Link below COL description VAL https://youtu.be/gVrCs58PNUU This is a much better HD copy of the music\, plus Stay a Little Longer.  Westenr Swing music from the 1940s.  This has Noel Boggs on Steel\, which means after the war probably 1946. Alex Beshear on trumpet plays it without a mute.  That was quite unusual for him.  Also Tommy sings it.  When Bob made the Okey 78\, the vocalist was Danny Alguire\, who also played trumpet.  Tommy had joined the army when that session took play. So here we get to hear the way he would have done it.  Just wish the quality was better.  Notice the accordian?  Bob never used one in his recordings\, and I have to wonder where Noel plugged in his steel guitar.  Behind a tree?  Hot session\, though.

COL title VAL Sentimental Me COL performer VAL Jack Jersey	COL video title VAL Affirmation - Jose Feliciano Original 1975 (also by Nujabes Counting Stars cover by George Benson) COL description VAL https://www.facebook.com/Jose-Feliciano-Fan-Area-1387556718159682  Affirmation Instrumental by Jose Feliciano recorded in his 1975 RCA album "Just Wann Rock'n'Roll"  FINALLY in CD !!!  in a new FANTASTIC COMPILATION for Jose Feliciano called "NO JIVE"...  (don't confuse  with many other compilations\, they has another 1996 re-recorded version)  NO JIVE is ABSOLUTELY THE BEST COMPILATION ABOUT JOSE FELICIANO 2 CD with his hit and many rarities never released before and many intrumentals  The song is also famous in the cover by George Benson in his hit album "Breezin" from 1976 and recently sampled by DJ Nujabes in Counting Stars part of the Samurai Champloo line up as "Shino's Theme" Video isn't of the.... Vinyl Version!!  here the story "How George Benson covered Affirmation by Jose Feliciano" by his producer LiPuma  A review by '70s for Breezin LP  Though Side One of Breezin' had the hits\, Side Two was a creamy\, seamless masterpiece unto itself. It unfolded with "Affirmation\," a song composed by Jose Feliciano\, the international superstar singer/guitarist/composer who had recorded it on his album\, Just Wanna Rock 'N' Roll (RCA)\, from the fall of '75. "Affirmation" was the sole instrumental on that Feliciano LP\, providing the blind Puerto Rican wunderkind a golden opportunity to showcase his skills on acoustic Spanish guitar\, electric rhythm guitar (with a wah-wah effect)\, electric bass\, congas and as a string arranger! LiPuma was enchanted with the melody of Feliciano's relatively brief (3:33) recording. When material was being prepared for Breezin'\, he presented it to Benson\, who liked it immediately. The band worked up an arrangement that loosened and elongated the vibe of the original. Like Feliciano's version\, George begins "Affirmation" alone\, caressing an introduction of choice notes and a smooth rendering of its signature run down the frets. But when the rhythm section eases in\, led by MacDonald's congas\, the groove is more relaxed and funky in a way that is quite different from Feliciano's more insistent arrangement\, which throbbed with forthright Latin pride. Where Feliciano had his rhythm section drop out for the soaring bridge\, Benson's band rides it like the wind\, drummer Mason liberating the rhythm by opening up on his cymbals. Benson tickles the strings with a tasty solo that leads into the killer breakdown section\, with Upchurch dipping into his effects bag. And then\, in what has to be one of the all-time classiest hand-offs in music\, Benson makes way for Dalto's wistful electric piano (complete with soulful little comps) before Benson takes it home\, getting in a few final signature licks. Benson's "Affirmation" is seven minutes of masterful musical heaven. http://www.fantasticfeliciano.too.it/ COL channel name VAL Thevolumex	0

I am depressed. Yet resurrected and sailing the crest. Why this elation\, mixed with deflation? What explanation? I am in love.  Such conflicting questions rise around in my brain: Should I order cynanide or order champagne?  Oh\, what is this sudden jolt? I feel like a frightened colt\, just hit by a thunderbolt. I am in love.  I knew the odds were against me before\, I had no flair for flaming desire\, But since the gods gave me you to adore\, I may lose but I refuse to fight the fire\,  So come and enlighten my days and never depart. You only can brighten the blaze that burns in my heart\, For I am wildly in love with you\, and so in need of a stampede of love.  I knew the odds were against me before\, I had no flair for flaming desire\, But since the gods gave me you to adore\, I may lose but I refuse to fight the fire\,  So come and enlighten my days and never depart. You only can brighten the blaze that burns in my heart\, For I am wildly in love with you\, and so in need of a stampede of love\, and so in need of a stampede of love.  http://www.stlyrics.com COL channel name VAL Michael C.	0

Since you been gone\, since you been gone. I'm out of my head can't take it. Could I be wrong\, but since you ben gone. You cast a spell so break it.  So in the night I stand\, beneath the back street light. I read the words that you sent to me. I can take the afternoon but night time comes around too soon. You can't know what you mean to me. Your poison letter\, your telegram. They go to show you don't give a damn.  Since you been gone\, since you been gone. I'm out of my head can't take it. Could I be wrong\, but since you ben gone.

COL title VAL Don't Let Me Down COL performer VAL Sam Tsui	COL video title VAL The Coal Porters - Another Girl\, Another Planet (live) COL description VAL The Coal Porters play Another Girl Another Planet live in Wales\, 2014.  Another Girl Another Planet is featured on The Coal Porters new album\, No. 6. No. 6\, is produced by John Wood\, the legendary British folk-rock mastermind who recorded the classic albums of Fairport Convention\, Nick Drake\, Beth Orton and Squeeze. No. 6 is a bit of a departure for the Coal Porters as it pushes their musical boundaries further than ever before.The Coal Porters - No. 6  https://thecoalporters.com / https://thecoalporters.bandcamp.com / https://www.facebook.com/thecoalporters  This new album features Kerenza quadruple tracking herself into a string quartet\, Andrew on a ukulele\, Sid on trusty autoharp and mandolin\, both Neil and Paul on dobro\, a Byrdsy acoustic 12-string guitar\, and very emotional\, long\, sweet trumpet solo by Cuba’s noted “son y mambo” music virtuoso Eikel Venegas. There has never been music like this before. And already\, the album’s opening track\, Sid’s “The Day The Last Ramone Died\,” is being hailed as a classic.  Recorded in two creative bursts in late 2014 and in 2015 this is the Coal Porters album which took three years to incubate. Four new Sid songs\, three new Neil Bob Herd originals\, and Kerenza Peacock contributed her first recorded lead vocal on a very personal song with Play A Tune while also gracing the record with a totally catchy instrumental\, Chopping The Garlic. The album goes out on a high note with the band’s warm-hearted cover of the Only Ones’ classic hit Another Girl\, Another Planet.  No.6 was released in September 2016 and can be ordered via Amazon\, iTunes\, the Sid Griffin website and in all good records stores.  Read more about No. 6 at http://www.sidgriffin.com/2016/09/06/the-coal-porters-no-6/  The Coal Porters are also on facebook at http://www.facebook.com/The-Coal-Porters COL channel name VAL The Coal Porters	0

The Sunsets were a 1950s-influenced rock'n'roll outfit from Penarth\, South Glamorgan that had evolved from a band\, previously called The Backbeats since 1958\,[3] who invited Stevens to join them after he had been an avid fan of the band for several years and occasionally hopped on stage to do a guest vocal.  An early break for Shaky and the band presented itself when they were given a support slot for The Rolling Stones in December 1969. Despite landing a recording contract with Parlophone Records the following year and releasing a Dave Edmunds produced album\, the optimistically and prematurely titled A Legend\, the band found success hard to come by\, at least in their native Great Britain\, though they had several hit singles in other countries. The band toured Germany and the Netherlands in between regular UK dates as the band's reputation for staging a vibrant and exciting show grew.[ COL channel name VAL ArkivArkiv	0
