It takes a great singer to really do justice to Dylan\, yet KT goes well beyond that and makes this her own. She's just that good live.  I work nights in a television studio and used to come home in the morning to find absolutely nothing interesting to watch on television. The last thing I wanted to see was more commercials. And I'm not really interested in watching talk shows and soap operas.  Then I discovered the commercial free music channel RAVE. HD quality video and pretty much perfect 5.1 sound. A few times a week they run "Later With Jools Holland" in the morning. Jools has great taste in music and each show runs the gamut from pop\, rock\, folk\, Celtic\, African\, to Joanna Newsome. Something for everyone. Suffice to say I love this show.  Uploaded as a high quality 640 x 480 MPEG4 file using Pinnacle Studio.

Márcio Greyck apresentou um programa chamado "O Mundo é dos Jovens"\, na extinta TV Tupi de São Paulo\, ao lado da cantora Sandra\, em 1967. Nessa época\, Roberto Carlos apresentava o programa "Jovem Guarda" na TV Record\, exibido de 1965 a 1968. Revista ROLLING STONE\, Outubro de 2008\, pag 158 : "No ano em que o mundo comemora as 40 primaveras do White Album\, lançado em 1968\, o Brasil acaba de dar à luz uma versão também democrática do disco duplo dos Beatles. No original\, pela primeira vez\, Paul\, John e George abriram espaço para Ringo colocar uma música sua no repertório\, e\, como instrumentistas\, cada um teve a chance de se mostrar individualmente. No Álbum Branco produzido pelo jornalista e pesquisador Marcelo Fróes\, os 30 convidados imprimiram seu estilo às músicas. Zé Ramalho canta "Dear Prudence" na velha conhecida "atmosfera mística"\, enquanto Daniel Tendler\, com timbre grave e vocal cuidadoso\, transforma "The Continuing Story Of Bungalow Bill" em canção para ninar gente grande. Pato Fu fez "Birthday" com cara de... Pato Fu. "I Will"\, com Érika Martins\, virou um delicioso folk\, enquanto "Julia" fez as vezes de bossa nova na voz e no violão de Celso Fonseca. Grande surpresa é a versão de Márcio Greyck para "Martha My Dear": com voz dobrada\, o músico faz bela interpretação da canção de Lennon e McCartney." (..)	0

COL title VAL Breathe COL performer VAL Our Broken Garden	COL video title VAL Grant Green_I Remember You COL channel name VAL rapitroy COL description VAL Personnel: Grant Green (guitar); Wilbur Ware (bass); Al Harewood (drums) (1961)  Producer: Alfred Lion.  Reissue producer: Michael Cuscuna.  Recorded at the Van Gelder Studio\, Englewood Cliffs\, New Jersey on August 29\, 1961. Includes liner notes by Pete Welding.  Digitally remastered using 20-bit technology by Ron McMaster.  Grant Green has always been somewhat neglected in the pantheon of jazz guitarists. Lacking the flash of Wes Montgomery and the cerebral intensity of Jim Hall\, his strengths tended to be overlooked\, but these strengths are well exhibited on STANDARDS.  Green brings a geometric simplicity to the melody of "You Stepped Out of a Dream\," his solos unfolding with more light than heat. On Gershwin's charming "Love Walked In\," his solo tumbles gently through the changes. He pauses to reflect on a note now and then\, giving the time elasticity and looseness rather than propulsion. Bassist Wilbur Ware is similarly underrated. It's hard to understand why--his pulse and sense of the architecture of a tune are without parallel. His rock-solid time on the ballad "If I Had You" shows why he was held in such high esteem by other musicians. Green and Ware work together like a pair of safecrackers\, each deftly anticipating and complementing the moves of the other\, while drummer Al Harewood keeps steady watch. This set of terse\, swinging jazz goes a long way towards fixing Grant Green's place in the jazz guitar firmament.	0

Tell me baby\, do you recognize me? Well\, it's been a year\, it doesn't surprise me. Merry Christmas\, I wrapped it up and sent it With a note saying 'I love you;' I meant it. Now I know what a fool I've been But if you kiss me now\, I know you'd fool me again.  //Last Christmas I gave you my heart But the very next day\, you gave it away This year\, to save me from tears I'll give it to someone special//  A crowded room\, friends with tired eyes I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice. My God\, I thought you were someone to rely on. Me\, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on. A face on a lover with a fire in his heart A man undercover but you tore me apart Now I've found a real love You'll never fool me again.  ///Last Christmas I gave you my heart But the very next day\, you gave it away This year\, to save me from tears I'll give it to someone special///  (In background: A face on a lover with a fire in his heart A man undercover but you tore me apart Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again)	0

It takes a great singer to really do justice to Dylan\, yet KT goes well beyond that and makes this her own. She's just that good live.  I work nights in a television studio and used to come home in the morning to find absolutely nothing interesting to watch on television. The last thing I wanted to see was more commercials. And I'm not really interested in watching talk shows and soap operas.  Then I discovered the commercial free music channel RAVE. HD quality video and pretty much perfect 5.1 sound. A few times a week they run "Later With Jools Holland" in the morning. Jools has great taste in music and each show runs the gamut from pop\, rock\, folk\, Celtic\, African\, to Joanna Newsome. Something for everyone. Suffice to say I love this show.  Uploaded as a high quality 640 x 480 MPEG4 file using Pinnacle Studio.

Records. The album consists of twelve cover songs and no originals. Autumn Records\, the band's previous label\, had sold the band to Warner Brothers in early 1966. Warner Brothers\, however\, did not control the publishing rights\, and opted to have the band record an album of covers\, including songs originally performed by Richard Berry\, Rolling Stones\, The Beatles and Bob Dylan\, as well as recent hit singles by such acts as The Mamas & the Papas and Simon & Garfunkel. Lead vocalist Sal Valentino explained\, "When we went to Warner Brothers\, they were just anxious to get a record out\, to capitalize on the success we had. That record was the wrong one to do at the time.  The album features Don Irving on guitar. Irving briefly became a member of the Beau Brummels filling in for Ron Elliott\, who also played on the album\, but was unable to withstand the rigors of touring due to his diabetic condition.	0

While its instrumental version is simply known as "The Godfather Love Theme"\, "Speak Softly Love" is the vocal version. The words are by Larry Kusik but the music itself is by Nino Rota. The signature musical theme that opens the piece closely models a theme that appears early in "Preludio - Povero Ernesto!" in the opera Don Pasquale by Gaetano Donizetti (1797-1848). A similar melody also appears in the Overture to "La Forza del Destino" by Giuseppe Verdi (1813-1901). There are also different sets of lyrics for the song in Italian ("Parla Più Piano") and also in Sicilian ("Brucia La Terra"). The Sicilian version is sung by Anthony Corleone (Franc D'Ambrosio) in The Godfather Part III.  Rota had used a more comedic version of the song for the 1958 film Fortunella. When this was discovered\, Rota's score for The Godfather was disqualified from consideration at the 1973 Academy Awards; it had been nominated for Best Original Score. However\, Rota's score for The Godfather Part II won the 1974 Academy Award for Best Original Score\, despite containing the same piece.  Recordings  The song was originally recorded by Andy Williams. Other artists\, such as Al Martino\, Eric Clapton and Bobby Vinton\, have also recorded the song\, among many others:  Slash regularly performs it in concerts in a rock style. Ken Boothe recorded a reggae version. Sergio Franchi recorded the theme song his 1976 DynaHouse album 20 Magnificent Songs. Satan's Pilgrims have performed a surf version as well. Harry Connick Jr. recorded it under the title "Parle Plus Bas". Gianni Morandi had covered the song under the title "Parla Più Piano". Dalida\, Tino Rossi\, Marie Laforêt\, and the Puppini Sisters covered the song under the title "Parle Plus Bas". A Ukrainian version\, "Say You Love Me" (Ukrainian: Скажи\, що любиш; Skazhy scho lyubysh) was performed by Sofia Rotaru in the musical film Song Is Always with Us. The Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra has also performed a ska version of the song. The song was also sampled for a song\, "Raja ko rani se pyar ho gaya" in the Indian film Akele Hum Akele Tum. In Yugoslavia it was adapted and sung by Tereza Kesovija as "Govori Tiše". Hungarian pop star György Korda released the Hungarian language version 1974 as "Gyöngéden ölelj át és ringass szerelem". Candies performed this song live in Osaka in 1977. Fantômas also recorded a metal version of the song on their album The Director's Cut. The Hot Club of Detroit recorded a Gypsy jazz cover of this song on their eponymous album. The Sicilian version from The Godfather Part III appears on the music compilation Mob Hits: the Best Songs of Mafia Movies. Speak Softly Love\, recorded in 2004 by the Norwegian singer Rein Alexander. The melody was used as the theme music and as a central plot device in the Soviet short animated film Contact. A Slovak version was done by František Krištof Veselý\, and a Czech version by Jiří Malásek. Scott Walker recorded a version for his 1972 album The Moviegoer. A Portuguese version called "Fale Baixinho" was recorded by Brazilian singer Wanderley Cardoso in 1972. German jazz pianist Wolfgang Liebert regularly performs it as a standard. Hip-hop artist RZA of Wu-Tang Clan samples the theme in "Black Mozart" on Raekwon's album Only Built 4 Cuban Linx II. The Italian version ("Parla Piu Piano"\, or "Io e Te") was recorded by Johnny Dorelli in 1973 . Dominic Chianese\, who portrayed Johnny Ola in The Godfather Part II\, recorded the Italian version for his album Ungrateful Heart. Mac Dre sampled the theme in his hip-hop song "Mafioso" from his 2003 album\, Al Boo Boo. Parle Plus Bas\, recorded in 2008 by French singer Patrick Fiori for his album Les Choses de La Vie. Rosenberg Trio recorded a version of this song on their 1992 album\, Impressions. The song was covered by several Hong Kong singers\, Frances Yip (葉麗儀) in 1972\, Irene Ryder (黎愛蓮) in 1973\, Juliana Luok (陸小雅) on her LP album Killing Me Softly\, and also\, by Singaporean singer Ling Ying (林櫻) on her LP album The Best Of Lin Ying & The Prinstar Punchers in 1972.	0

Blackberry winter only lasts a few days\, Just long enough to get you feeling sad When you think of all the love that you wasted On someone whom you never really had.  I'll never get over losing you But I've had to learn that life goes on And the memories grow dim like a half forgotten song 'Til the blackberry winter reminds me you are gone.  And I get so lonely\, most of all in springtime I wish I could enjoy the first of May But I know it means that blackberry winter Is not too far away.	0

Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels The dizzy dancing way you feel when every fairy tale comes real I've looked at love that way But now it's just another show You leave 'em laughing when you go And if you care\, don't let them know Don't give yourself away I've looked at love from both sides now From win and lose\, and still somehow It's love's illusions I recall I really don't know love at all Tears and fears and feeling proud To say "I love you" right out loud Dreams and schemes and circus crowds I've looked at life that way But now old friends are acting strange They shake their heads\, they say I've changed Well something's lost\, but something's gained In living every day I've looked at life from both sides now From win and lose and still somehow It's life's illusions I recall I really don't know life at all I've looked at life from both sides now From up and dawn\, and still somehow It's life's illusions I recall I really don't know life at all.	0

She takes two songs that I've been waiting for someone to cover since Fruits de Mer was still a winkle in someone's eye -- The Troggs' disturbed and disturbing  'Cousin Jane' and the long-lost Second Hand's 1968 classic 'A Fairy Tale' - and adds a carefully-crafted 'Play With Fire'\, previously recorded by the little-known rock combo\, The Rolling Stones.

COL title VAL I Don't Know Why\, I Just Do COL performer VAL The Belmonts	COL video title VAL Elvis Presley - Money Honey COL channel name VAL Music Legends Book COL description VAL Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8\, 1935 – August 16\, 1977) was an American singer and actor. Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century\, he is often referred to as "the King of Rock and Roll"\, or simply\, "the King". Presley was born in Tupelo\, Mississippi as a twinless twin\, and when he was 13 years old\, he and his family relocated to Memphis\, Tennessee. His music career began there in 1954\, when he recorded a song with producer Sam Phillips at Sun Records. Accompanied by guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black\, Presley was an early popularizer of rockabilly\, an uptempo\, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker\, who managed the singer for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single\, "Heartbreak Hotel"\, was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. He was regarded as the leading figure of rock and roll after a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style\, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines that coincided with the dawn of the Civil Rights Movement\, made him enormously popular and controversial. In November 1956\, he made his film debut in Love Me Tender. In 1958\, he was drafted into military service. He resumed his recording career two years later\, producing some of his most commercially successful work before devoting much of the 1960s to making Hollywood movies and their accompanying soundtrack albums\, most of which were critically derided. In 1968\, following a seven-year break from live performances\, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed televised comeback special Elvis\, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973\, Presley was featured in the first globally broadcast concert via satellite\, Aloha from Hawaii. Several years of prescription drug abuse severely damaged his health\, and he died in 1977 at the age of 42. Presley is one of the most celebrated and influential musicians of the 20th century. Commercially successful in many genres\, including pop\, blues and gospel\, he is the best-selling solo artist in the history of recorded music\, with estimated record sales of around 600 million units worldwide. He won three Grammys\, also receiving the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36\, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame. Forbes named Elvis Presley as the 2nd top earning dead celebrity with $55 million as of 2011.	0

It is related to a group of early 20th century blues and work songs that include "I'm Alabama Bound"\, "Another Man Done Gone"\, and "Don't Leave Me Here"\, and "Turn Your Lamp Down Low". It has become a blues and rock standard\, and has been recorded by many artists.  The original 1935 single by Joe Williams' Washboard Blues Singers can be heard on Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music\, Vol. 4 (Revenant\, 2000).  Notable cover versions  Van Morrison and Them  The band Them\, fronted by Van Morrison\, released "Baby\, Please Don't Go" as the A side of a single in late 1964. Boosted by the B side\, a ditty entitled "Gloria"\, the single became their first hit\, reaching No. 10 on the UK Singles Chart. Rhythm guitar was contributed by a then little-known Jimmy Page\, however he did not play the lead guitar on the track. It was re-released on the Deram label in 1973.  John Lee Hooker's posthumously released DVD Come See About Me includes a 1992 performance where Hooker plays "Baby\, Please Don't Go" on his guitar while sitting on a dock. He is accompanied on harmonica by Them's Van Morrison.  Amboy Dukes / Ted Nugent  Since it was The Amboy Dukes' debut single\, former Dukes guitarist Ted Nugent has covered the song in live performances throughout his career. The single is included on the 1967 album The Amboy Dukes.  AC/DC recorded a version for their 1975 Australia-only album High Voltage; it was released internationally in 1984 on their compilation EP '74 Jailbreak.  Aerosmith released a version of "Baby\, Please Don't Go" on their blues cover album\, Honkin' on Bobo in 2004.

COL title VAL I Mean You COL performer VAL Cyrille Aimée + Friends	COL video title VAL Elvis Presley - Money Honey COL channel name VAL Music Legends Book COL description VAL Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8\, 1935 – August 16\, 1977) was an American singer and actor. Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century\, he is often referred to as "the King of Rock and Roll"\, or simply\, "the King". Presley was born in Tupelo\, Mississippi as a twinless twin\, and when he was 13 years old\, he and his family relocated to Memphis\, Tennessee. His music career began there in 1954\, when he recorded a song with producer Sam Phillips at Sun Records. Accompanied by guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black\, Presley was an early popularizer of rockabilly\, an uptempo\, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker\, who managed the singer for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single\, "Heartbreak Hotel"\, was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. He was regarded as the leading figure of rock and roll after a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style\, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines that coincided with the dawn of the Civil Rights Movement\, made him enormously popular and controversial. In November 1956\, he made his film debut in Love Me Tender. In 1958\, he was drafted into military service. He resumed his recording career two years later\, producing some of his most commercially successful work before devoting much of the 1960s to making Hollywood movies and their accompanying soundtrack albums\, most of which were critically derided. In 1968\, following a seven-year break from live performances\, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed televised comeback special Elvis\, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973\, Presley was featured in the first globally broadcast concert via satellite\, Aloha from Hawaii. Several years of prescription drug abuse severely damaged his health\, and he died in 1977 at the age of 42. Presley is one of the most celebrated and influential musicians of the 20th century. Commercially successful in many genres\, including pop\, blues and gospel\, he is the best-selling solo artist in the history of recorded music\, with estimated record sales of around 600 million units worldwide. He won three Grammys\, also receiving the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36\, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame. Forbes named Elvis Presley as the 2nd top earning dead celebrity with $55 million as of 2011.	0

Ještě za trest v rohu postůj za svý vzpurný chování. Ještě jednou zazvoň zvoncem\, jako když byl štědrej den. A za příběh s šťastným koncem připiš\, nevěř s velkým N. Motýl s větrem dovnitř vlít. Můžeš zůstat\, můžeš jít.  A pak vzpomeň\, co tě nutí navždy pláchnout z těchto míst. Na tu křivdu s trpkou chutí\, kterou nelze\, nelze snýst. Kdo ty místa změnil v klec a zbořil bránu ke štěstí. Kdo tě nazval lehkou holkou a tvou lásku neřestí. Tolik špíny\, tolik bláta\, ani jeden vlídnej tón. To snad nebyl vlastní táta\, to snad vůbec nebyl on. Jak ta rána jak se zhojí\, jak to zpátky všechno vzít. Máš jak motýl možnost dvojí. Můžeš zůstat\, můžeš jít.  Je však pozdě\, všechno pomiň\, darmo smlouvat není s kým. Žádný odpusť\, žádný promiň. Běž a chvátej za tím svým. Teď jde o tvý právo žít. Ejhle\, motýl k nebi vzlít. Nesmíš zůstat\, musíš jít.  text a foto: vondrackova.net	1

Only mine's broke down And now I've no-one to love  So I find out your reason For the phone calls and smiles And it hurts And I'm lonely And I should never have tried And I missed you tonight It must be time to leave You see it meant everything to me	0

COL title VAL I'm Gonna Move to the Outskirts of Town COL performer VAL Lou Rawls and Les McCann Ltd.	COL video title VAL Nat Kendrick and The Swans - (Do The) Mashed Potatoes COL channel name VAL John1948NineD COL description VAL "(Do the) Mashed Potatoes" is a rhythm and blues instrumental. It was recorded by James Brown with his band in 1959 and released as a two-part single in 1960. For contractual reasons the recording was credited to "Nat Kendrick and the Swans."  The recording of "(Do the) Mashed Potatoes" arose out of James Brown's success in using the Mashed Potato dance as part of his stage show. Brown wanted to record a Mashed Potatoes-themed instrumental with his band in order to capitalize on the dance's popularity. However\, King Records head Syd Nathan\, a frequent critic of Brown's proposals\, would not allow it. (The first instrumental recorded by Brown and his band\, titled "Doodle Bug" and credited to Brown's tenor saxophonist J.C. Davis\, had not sold well when it was released on King's sister label Federal Records.) Brown approached Henry Stone\, a friend in the music business who ran the Dade Records label\, about recording the piece with him. Stone\, although nervous about crossing Nathan (with whom he did business)\, arranged for Brown to record at his Miami studio.  "(Do the) Mashed Potatoes" was recorded with Brown playing the piano and shouting the song's title. To prevent Brown's voice from being recognized\, Stone overdubbed shouted vocals by Carlton "King" Coleman\, a local radio DJ\, onto the recording\, though Brown's voice remains audible in the background. Leadership of the band was officially credited to Nat Kendrick\, who was Brown's drummer at the time\, while the writing was credited to "Dessie Rozier"\, a pseudonym for Brown. A simple twelve bar blues tune\, "(Do the) Mashed Potatoes" became a Top Ten R&B hit in 1960 and fed what would eventually grow into a national dance craze. The band recorded several more singles under the Nat Kendrick & the Swans name\, including "Dish Rag"\, "Slow Down"\, and "Wobble Wobble"\, but none were successful. Eventually made aware of Brown's outside success\, Syd Nathan relented and allowed him to release future instrumentals on King\, starting with the 1961 single "Hold It" b/w "The Scratch".  James Brown had a second Mashed Potatoes-themed hit with "Mashed Potatoes U.S.A." in 1962.  Personnel: "Nat Kendrick & The Swans": Carlton "King" Coleman - lead vocal Alfred Corley - alto saxophone J.C. Davis - tenor saxophone James Brown - piano\, vocal yelps Bobby Roach - guitar Bernard Odum - bass Nat Kendrick - drums  SOURCE: Wikipedia  PLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels\, Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

COL title VAL Cotton Fields COL performer VAL Porter Wagoner	COL video title VAL Nat Kendrick and The Swans - (Do The) Mashed Potatoes COL channel name VAL John1948NineD COL description VAL "(Do the) Mashed Potatoes" is a rhythm and blues instrumental. It was recorded by James Brown with his band in 1959 and released as a two-part single in 1960. For contractual reasons the recording was credited to "Nat Kendrick and the Swans."  The recording of "(Do the) Mashed Potatoes" arose out of James Brown's success in using the Mashed Potato dance as part of his stage show. Brown wanted to record a Mashed Potatoes-themed instrumental with his band in order to capitalize on the dance's popularity. However\, King Records head Syd Nathan\, a frequent critic of Brown's proposals\, would not allow it. (The first instrumental recorded by Brown and his band\, titled "Doodle Bug" and credited to Brown's tenor saxophonist J.C. Davis\, had not sold well when it was released on King's sister label Federal Records.) Brown approached Henry Stone\, a friend in the music business who ran the Dade Records label\, about recording the piece with him. Stone\, although nervous about crossing Nathan (with whom he did business)\, arranged for Brown to record at his Miami studio.  "(Do the) Mashed Potatoes" was recorded with Brown playing the piano and shouting the song's title. To prevent Brown's voice from being recognized\, Stone overdubbed shouted vocals by Carlton "King" Coleman\, a local radio DJ\, onto the recording\, though Brown's voice remains audible in the background. Leadership of the band was officially credited to Nat Kendrick\, who was Brown's drummer at the time\, while the writing was credited to "Dessie Rozier"\, a pseudonym for Brown. A simple twelve bar blues tune\, "(Do the) Mashed Potatoes" became a Top Ten R&B hit in 1960 and fed what would eventually grow into a national dance craze. The band recorded several more singles under the Nat Kendrick & the Swans name\, including "Dish Rag"\, "Slow Down"\, and "Wobble Wobble"\, but none were successful. Eventually made aware of Brown's outside success\, Syd Nathan relented and allowed him to release future instrumentals on King\, starting with the 1961 single "Hold It" b/w "The Scratch".  James Brown had a second Mashed Potatoes-themed hit with "Mashed Potatoes U.S.A." in 1962.  Personnel: "Nat Kendrick & The Swans": Carlton "King" Coleman - lead vocal Alfred Corley - alto saxophone J.C. Davis - tenor saxophone James Brown - piano\, vocal yelps Bobby Roach - guitar Bernard Odum - bass Nat Kendrick - drums  SOURCE: Wikipedia  PLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels\, Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

Márcio Greyck apresentou um programa chamado "O Mundo é dos Jovens"\, na extinta TV Tupi de São Paulo\, ao lado da cantora Sandra\, em 1967. Nessa época\, Roberto Carlos apresentava o programa "Jovem Guarda" na TV Record\, exibido de 1965 a 1968. Revista ROLLING STONE\, Outubro de 2008\, pag 158 : "No ano em que o mundo comemora as 40 primaveras do White Album\, lançado em 1968\, o Brasil acaba de dar à luz uma versão também democrática do disco duplo dos Beatles. No original\, pela primeira vez\, Paul\, John e George abriram espaço para Ringo colocar uma música sua no repertório\, e\, como instrumentistas\, cada um teve a chance de se mostrar individualmente. No Álbum Branco produzido pelo jornalista e pesquisador Marcelo Fróes\, os 30 convidados imprimiram seu estilo às músicas. Zé Ramalho canta "Dear Prudence" na velha conhecida "atmosfera mística"\, enquanto Daniel Tendler\, com timbre grave e vocal cuidadoso\, transforma "The Continuing Story Of Bungalow Bill" em canção para ninar gente grande. Pato Fu fez "Birthday" com cara de... Pato Fu. "I Will"\, com Érika Martins\, virou um delicioso folk\, enquanto "Julia" fez as vezes de bossa nova na voz e no violão de Celso Fonseca. Grande surpresa é a versão de Márcio Greyck para "Martha My Dear": com voz dobrada\, o músico faz bela interpretação da canção de Lennon e McCartney." (..)	0

While its instrumental version is simply known as "The Godfather Love Theme"\, "Speak Softly Love" is the vocal version. The words are by Larry Kusik but the music itself is by Nino Rota. The signature musical theme that opens the piece closely models a theme that appears early in "Preludio - Povero Ernesto!" in the opera Don Pasquale by Gaetano Donizetti (1797-1848). A similar melody also appears in the Overture to "La Forza del Destino" by Giuseppe Verdi (1813-1901). There are also different sets of lyrics for the song in Italian ("Parla Più Piano") and also in Sicilian ("Brucia La Terra"). The Sicilian version is sung by Anthony Corleone (Franc D'Ambrosio) in The Godfather Part III.  Rota had used a more comedic version of the song for the 1958 film Fortunella. When this was discovered\, Rota's score for The Godfather was disqualified from consideration at the 1973 Academy Awards; it had been nominated for Best Original Score. However\, Rota's score for The Godfather Part II won the 1974 Academy Award for Best Original Score\, despite containing the same piece.  Recordings  The song was originally recorded by Andy Williams. Other artists\, such as Al Martino\, Eric Clapton and Bobby Vinton\, have also recorded the song\, among many others:  Slash regularly performs it in concerts in a rock style. Ken Boothe recorded a reggae version. Sergio Franchi recorded the theme song his 1976 DynaHouse album 20 Magnificent Songs. Satan's Pilgrims have performed a surf version as well. Harry Connick Jr. recorded it under the title "Parle Plus Bas". Gianni Morandi had covered the song under the title "Parla Più Piano". Dalida\, Tino Rossi\, Marie Laforêt\, and the Puppini Sisters covered the song under the title "Parle Plus Bas". A Ukrainian version\, "Say You Love Me" (Ukrainian: Скажи\, що любиш; Skazhy scho lyubysh) was performed by Sofia Rotaru in the musical film Song Is Always with Us. The Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra has also performed a ska version of the song. The song was also sampled for a song\, "Raja ko rani se pyar ho gaya" in the Indian film Akele Hum Akele Tum. In Yugoslavia it was adapted and sung by Tereza Kesovija as "Govori Tiše". Hungarian pop star György Korda released the Hungarian language version 1974 as "Gyöngéden ölelj át és ringass szerelem". Candies performed this song live in Osaka in 1977. Fantômas also recorded a metal version of the song on their album The Director's Cut. The Hot Club of Detroit recorded a Gypsy jazz cover of this song on their eponymous album. The Sicilian version from The Godfather Part III appears on the music compilation Mob Hits: the Best Songs of Mafia Movies. Speak Softly Love\, recorded in 2004 by the Norwegian singer Rein Alexander. The melody was used as the theme music and as a central plot device in the Soviet short animated film Contact. A Slovak version was done by František Krištof Veselý\, and a Czech version by Jiří Malásek. Scott Walker recorded a version for his 1972 album The Moviegoer. A Portuguese version called "Fale Baixinho" was recorded by Brazilian singer Wanderley Cardoso in 1972. German jazz pianist Wolfgang Liebert regularly performs it as a standard. Hip-hop artist RZA of Wu-Tang Clan samples the theme in "Black Mozart" on Raekwon's album Only Built 4 Cuban Linx II. The Italian version ("Parla Piu Piano"\, or "Io e Te") was recorded by Johnny Dorelli in 1973 . Dominic Chianese\, who portrayed Johnny Ola in The Godfather Part II\, recorded the Italian version for his album Ungrateful Heart. Mac Dre sampled the theme in his hip-hop song "Mafioso" from his 2003 album\, Al Boo Boo. Parle Plus Bas\, recorded in 2008 by French singer Patrick Fiori for his album Les Choses de La Vie. Rosenberg Trio recorded a version of this song on their 1992 album\, Impressions. The song was covered by several Hong Kong singers\, Frances Yip (葉麗儀) in 1972\, Irene Ryder (黎愛蓮) in 1973\, Juliana Luok (陸小雅) on her LP album Killing Me Softly\, and also\, by Singaporean singer Ling Ying (林櫻) on her LP album The Best Of Lin Ying & The Prinstar Punchers in 1972.	0

COL title VAL Penny Lane COL performer VAL The Hollyridge Strings	COL video title VAL Agnetha Faltskog - My Colouring Book COL channel name VAL abbafanglosuk COL description VAL After the release of I Stand Alone in 1988\, Agnetha took a break from her musical career and completely withdrew from public life.  In April 2004\, after 17 years of silence Agnetha came back with a bang by releasing the album My Colouring Book\, a collection of covers of 1960s classic oldies. The album topped the charts in Sweden\, reached top 5 in some countries and No.12 in UK.  The Times reviewer noted "her voice is still an impressive pop instrument"\, and The Observer noted "time hasn't diminished her perfect voice". The album release attracted major media attention across Europe\, but Agnetha refused to be involved in any publicity.  Despite this\, the album sold more than 500\,000 copies worldwide\, with 50\,000 of those in the UK alone. Agnetha has a fear of flying and has not been on an airplane for over 15 years.  When she goes abroad she prefers to travel by car. She prefers a tranquil life in a rural suburb south-west of Stockholm\, away from the noisy city atmosphere. Agnetha wrote these cover notes for My Colouring Book: The early impressions in life are etched with a particular strength and clarity.  That applies especially to music. So this album is a celebration of the music I heard yesterday.  A respectful homage to the artists who have inspired me and left deep prints in my soul and in my heart. This is the soundtrack of a time lost\, to which I return to\, with the mighty forces of music. I have enjoyed these songs all my life and they hold a special place in my heart. My effort was to recreate these songs with all respect for the originals.  My Colouring Book is my way of showing gratitude towards the songs\, the artists and all they have given me.  You are all deep within my heart and will stay there forever. To my family\, my friends\, to all listeners around the world and to everyone involved in this project - thank you for inspiring me to do this - I love you. Agnetha raises her voice dramatically for the third and fifth verses in this song\, to produce some of the most emotional singing I've ever heard.  She may be 53 here\, but as this picture shows\, Agnetha is still as beautiful as ever.    Words & Music by Fred Ebb & John Kander Originally recorded by Kitty Kallen in 1962.  Lyrics:   For those who fancy colouring books\, And lots of people do\, Here´s a new one for you\, A most unusual colouring book\,  The kind you never see\, Crayons ready very well\, Begin to colour me  These are the eyes that watched him\, As he walked away\, Colour them grey\,  This is the heart that thought\, He would always be true\, Colour it blue  These are the arms that held him\, And loved him then lost him somehow\, Oh... colour them empty now  These are the beads\, I wore until she came between\, Colour them green  This is the room that I sleep in\, And walk in\, and weep in\,  And hide in that nobody sees\,  Oh... colour it lonely please  This is the man\, Whose love I depended upon\, Colour him gone.	0

Sehorn\, Wilbert Harrison  Recorded at Reflection Sound Studio\, Charlotte\, N.C.  Remixed at Select Sound Studios  ------------------------  "My Babe" is a blues song and a blues standard written by Willie Dixon for Little Walter. Released in 1955 on Checker Records\, a subsidiary of Chess Records\, the song was the only Dixon composition ever to become a no. 1 R&B single\, and it was one of the biggest hits of either of their careers.   The song was based on the traditional gospel song "This Train (Is Bound For Glory)"\, which Sister Rosetta Tharpe recorded in the 1939 hit\, "This Train". Dixon reworked the arrangement and lyrics from the sacred\, the procession of saints into Heaven\, into the secular\, a story about a woman that won't stand for her man to cheat: "My baby\, she don't stand no cheating\, my babe\, she don't stand none of that midnight creeping".  Ray Charles had famously\, and controversially\, pioneered the gospel-song-to-secular-song approach with his reworking of the gospel hymn "It Must Be Jesus." into "I Got a Woman"\, which hit the Billboard R&B charts on January 22\, 1955\, later climbing to the #1 position for one week. Within days of the appearance of Charles's song on the national charts\, Little Walter entered the studio to record "My Babe"\, on January 25\, 1955. "My Babe" was released while "I've Got A Woman" was still on the charts\, and eclipsed Charles's record by spending 19 weeks on the Billboard R&B charts beginning on March 12\, 1955\, including five weeks at the number one position\, making it one of the biggest R&B hits of 1955.  The "B" side of "My Babe" was the harmonica instrumental "Thunderbird"\, following the pattern established by the release of Little Walter's number #1 hit single from 1952\, "Juke"\, of featuring a vocal performance one side and a harmonica instrumental on the flip side.  Recording  Although no documentation exists\, the song was probably recorded at Universal Recorders in Chicago\, the site of the majority of Chess and Checker sessions until Chess opened their own studio c. 1956/'57. Backing Little Walter's vocals and harmonica were Robert Lockwood\, Jr. and Leonard Caston on guitars\, Willie Dixon on double-bass\, and Fred Below on drums.  Guitarist Luther Tucker\, then a member of Walter's band\, was absent from the recording session that day. "My Babe" was re-issued in 1961 with an overdubbed female vocal backing chorus and briefly crossed over to the pop charts.   Cover Versions  The success of song lead to dozens of cover versions by many diverse artists: Elvis Presley released a live cover on the album From Memphis to Vegas/From Vegas to Memphis Dale Hawkins released "My Babe" as a single by Checker Records Chuck Berry covered the song on Chuck Berry in 1975 The song was performed by Little Walter\, Bo Diddley\, and Muddy Waters on Super Blues Sonny Burgess and the Pacers on their self-titled album Cliff Richard on Cliff Ricky Nelson on his 1958 album Ricky Nelson Peter & Gordon on In Touch With... Donald Byrd on Up with Donald Byrd Ronnie Milsap on Just for a Thrill Conway Twitty\, Ramsey Lewis\, Grant Green\, Mississippi Fred McDowell\, Coleman Hawkins\, Gene Ammons\, The Everly Brothers\, The Animals\,the Steve Miller Band\, Lou Rawls\, Ike & Tina Turner\, and many others have also covered the song. Mose Allison rewrote it as "My Brain" and recorded it for his 2010 album "The Way of the World". The song "My Babe" by the Spencer Davis Group (Stevie Winwood) on their first album is a different song. "My Babe" was performed by Ben Harper\, with James Cotton sitting in on blues harp\, during the induction ceremony for Little Walter into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame on March 10\, 2008. "My Babe" was sung by Robert Britton Lyons\, portraying Carl Perkins\, in medley with "Sixteen Tons" sung by Lance Guest\, portraying Johnny Cash\, in the Broadway musical "Million Dollar Quartet\," which opened in New York in April\, 2010. Lyons and Guest also covered the songs on the "Million Dollar Quartet" original Broadway cast recording\, copyright 2010 by MDQ Merchandising\, LLC."	0

According to Velasquez\, the song was inspired by an aria from an opera by Enrique Granados\, a Spanish composer and pianist of classical music. Played by Trio Los Panchos\, whether this was the first version I'm not sure but I found this version is the best version I've ever heard so far\, particularly their outstanding guitar arrangement.  The lyric goes :  Bésame\, bésame mucho como si fuera esta noche la última vez\, bésame\, bésame mucho que tengo miedo perderte perderte después.  Quiero tenerte muy cerca mirarme en tus ojos y estar junto a ti\, piensa que tal vez mañana estaré muy lejos muy lejos de aquí\,   bésame\, bésame mucho como si fuera esta noche la última vez\, bésame\, bésame mucho que tengo miedo perderte perderte después  Enjoy !	0

COL title VAL Down by the Riverside COL performer VAL Billy Riley	COL video title VAL Clover-Travellin' Man COL channel name VAL MrBashpop COL description VAL Band from the Bay Area who were signed to Fantasy Records\, the label which of course featured CCR.  Clover released two country-rock albums before changing their sound to something closer to pub rock\, whereupon Nick Lowe heard them\, really liked them\, and hooked them up with Jake Riviera and Elvis Costello\, which led to several members backing Elvis on My Aim Is True and two excellent albums on the Vertigo label.  However\, what Clover has become most famous for is featuring a lead singer/harmonica player by the name of Huey Lewis\, who of course went on to great fame in the '80s and beyond.  I really love this cover of The Ricky Nelson hit; it shows off just how tight Clover was\, and how amazing their vocals were!	0

COL title VAL Carol of the Bells COL performer VAL Doug Hammer	COL video title VAL Agnetha Faltskog - My Colouring Book COL channel name VAL abbafanglosuk COL description VAL After the release of I Stand Alone in 1988\, Agnetha took a break from her musical career and completely withdrew from public life.  In April 2004\, after 17 years of silence Agnetha came back with a bang by releasing the album My Colouring Book\, a collection of covers of 1960s classic oldies. The album topped the charts in Sweden\, reached top 5 in some countries and No.12 in UK.  The Times reviewer noted "her voice is still an impressive pop instrument"\, and The Observer noted "time hasn't diminished her perfect voice". The album release attracted major media attention across Europe\, but Agnetha refused to be involved in any publicity.  Despite this\, the album sold more than 500\,000 copies worldwide\, with 50\,000 of those in the UK alone. Agnetha has a fear of flying and has not been on an airplane for over 15 years.  When she goes abroad she prefers to travel by car. She prefers a tranquil life in a rural suburb south-west of Stockholm\, away from the noisy city atmosphere. Agnetha wrote these cover notes for My Colouring Book: The early impressions in life are etched with a particular strength and clarity.  That applies especially to music. So this album is a celebration of the music I heard yesterday.  A respectful homage to the artists who have inspired me and left deep prints in my soul and in my heart. This is the soundtrack of a time lost\, to which I return to\, with the mighty forces of music. I have enjoyed these songs all my life and they hold a special place in my heart. My effort was to recreate these songs with all respect for the originals.  My Colouring Book is my way of showing gratitude towards the songs\, the artists and all they have given me.  You are all deep within my heart and will stay there forever. To my family\, my friends\, to all listeners around the world and to everyone involved in this project - thank you for inspiring me to do this - I love you. Agnetha raises her voice dramatically for the third and fifth verses in this song\, to produce some of the most emotional singing I've ever heard.  She may be 53 here\, but as this picture shows\, Agnetha is still as beautiful as ever.    Words & Music by Fred Ebb & John Kander Originally recorded by Kitty Kallen in 1962.  Lyrics:   For those who fancy colouring books\, And lots of people do\, Here´s a new one for you\, A most unusual colouring book\,  The kind you never see\, Crayons ready very well\, Begin to colour me  These are the eyes that watched him\, As he walked away\, Colour them grey\,  This is the heart that thought\, He would always be true\, Colour it blue  These are the arms that held him\, And loved him then lost him somehow\, Oh... colour them empty now  These are the beads\, I wore until she came between\, Colour them green  This is the room that I sleep in\, And walk in\, and weep in\,  And hide in that nobody sees\,  Oh... colour it lonely please  This is the man\, Whose love I depended upon\, Colour him gone.	0

COL title VAL Body and Soul COL performer VAL Stan Getz	COL video title VAL Billy Eckstine -- If Ever I Would Leave You COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Billy Eckstine (Pittsburgh\, 8 de julio de 1914 - Pittsburgh\, 8 de marzo de 1993) fue un cantante estadounidense de jazz y música pop. Poseedor de una voz de barítono\, fue durante los años cuarenta una figura carismática de la música popular negra\, al liderar una de las primeras big band de bop y convertirse en el primer cantante negro de baladas románticas (fue llamado el Sinatra negro). Con el paso de los años\, su influencia ha sido considerable en el ámbito del soul y el rhythm and blues.  Eckstine comenzó a cantar a los nueve años y participó en numerosos espectáculos para aficionados. Aunque su vocación había sido la de jugador de fútbol americano\, una grave lesión lo recondujo hacia el mundo de la música. Tras diversos trabajos al oeste de Chicago a finales de los años treinta\, Eckstine fue invitado por Earl Hines para unirse a su Grand Terrace Orchestra en 1939.  Aunque sus primeros éxitos fueron canciones triviales como "Jelly\, Jelly" y "The Jitney Man"\, grabó también varios estándares como "Stormy Monday". Hacia 1943\, se acompañaba de estrellas como Dizzy Gillespie\, Charlie Parker y Sarah Vaughan. Tras formar su propia banda ese año\, contrató a los tres y gradualmente se hizo con más figuras modernas y con futuras estrellas: Wardell Gray\, Dexter Gordon\, Miles Davis\, Kenny Dorham\, Fats Navarro y Art Blakey\, así como con arreglistas como Tadd Dameron y Gil Fuller. La Billy Eckstine Orchestra fue la primera big band bop\, y su líder reflejaba las innovaciones bop adaptando sus armonías vocales a las baladas normales. A pesar del matiz moderno del grupo\, Eckstine encabezó las listas frecuentemente a mediados de los cuarenta\, con temas como "A Cottage for Sale" y "Prisoner of Love". En las giras por Europa y América\, el cantante tocaba también la trompeta\, el trombón de válvulas y la guitarra.  Forzado a disolver la orquesta en 1947 tras haber formado la suya propia Gillespie\, Eckstine realizó una transición hacia un estilo más baladístico y con arreglos de cuerda. Grabó más de una docena de éxitos a finales de los cuarenta\, entre lo que se incluyen "My Foolish Heart" y "I Apologize". Se hizo popular en Gran Bretaña\, obteniendo un gran éxito durante los cincuenta con temas como "No One But You" y "Gigi"\, así como con sus dúos con Sarah Vaughan. Eckstine regresaría a sus raíces jazzísticas ocasionalmente\, grabando con Vaughan\, Count Basie y Quincy Jones\, y grabando un LP en directo\, No Cover\, No Minimum\, en el que interpretaba algunos solos de trompeta. Grabó varios discos para Mercury y Roulette a comienzos de los sesenta y publicó en Motown algunos discos de estándares a mediados de esa década. Tras grabar muy espaciadamente en los setenta\, Eckstine hizo su última grabación (Billy Eckstine Sings with Benny Carter) en 1986. Murió por un ataque al corazón en 1993.

Ryder released another medley song in 1968; "("You've Got) Personality/Chantilly Lace"\, originally done respectively by Lee Price and The Big Bopper. The single didn't fare well on the Hot 100\, only got as high as #87\, and became Ryder's final Hot 100 entry....until 1983\, when he released a cover of Prince's "When You We're Mine". Unfortunately\, that single also reached #87! "Personality/Chantilly Lace" deserved a better chart fate\, because it still captures the raw-ness of Ryder's vocals and hard-rocking rhythm.	0

It is related to a group of early 20th century blues and work songs that include "I'm Alabama Bound"\, "Another Man Done Gone"\, and "Don't Leave Me Here"\, and "Turn Your Lamp Down Low". It has become a blues and rock standard\, and has been recorded by many artists.  The original 1935 single by Joe Williams' Washboard Blues Singers can be heard on Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music\, Vol. 4 (Revenant\, 2000).  Notable cover versions  Van Morrison and Them  The band Them\, fronted by Van Morrison\, released "Baby\, Please Don't Go" as the A side of a single in late 1964. Boosted by the B side\, a ditty entitled "Gloria"\, the single became their first hit\, reaching No. 10 on the UK Singles Chart. Rhythm guitar was contributed by a then little-known Jimmy Page\, however he did not play the lead guitar on the track. It was re-released on the Deram label in 1973.  John Lee Hooker's posthumously released DVD Come See About Me includes a 1992 performance where Hooker plays "Baby\, Please Don't Go" on his guitar while sitting on a dock. He is accompanied on harmonica by Them's Van Morrison.  Amboy Dukes / Ted Nugent  Since it was The Amboy Dukes' debut single\, former Dukes guitarist Ted Nugent has covered the song in live performances throughout his career. The single is included on the 1967 album The Amboy Dukes.  AC/DC recorded a version for their 1975 Australia-only album High Voltage; it was released internationally in 1984 on their compilation EP '74 Jailbreak.  Aerosmith released a version of "Baby\, Please Don't Go" on their blues cover album\, Honkin' on Bobo in 2004.

Set for release June 4\, 2013\, this recording is one of the most meaningful of Benson's career and is a testament to the spirit of Cole's timeless body of work.

Speaking on recording the album Benson says\, "I felt every moment of it. You can't put together a record like this without putting your heart into it. I got that from Nat King Cole. He put his heart into everything he did."	0

COL title VAL My Coloring Book COL performer VAL Joni James	COL video title VAL Agnetha Faltskog - My Colouring Book COL channel name VAL abbafanglosuk COL description VAL After the release of I Stand Alone in 1988\, Agnetha took a break from her musical career and completely withdrew from public life.  In April 2004\, after 17 years of silence Agnetha came back with a bang by releasing the album My Colouring Book\, a collection of covers of 1960s classic oldies. The album topped the charts in Sweden\, reached top 5 in some countries and No.12 in UK.  The Times reviewer noted "her voice is still an impressive pop instrument"\, and The Observer noted "time hasn't diminished her perfect voice". The album release attracted major media attention across Europe\, but Agnetha refused to be involved in any publicity.  Despite this\, the album sold more than 500\,000 copies worldwide\, with 50\,000 of those in the UK alone. Agnetha has a fear of flying and has not been on an airplane for over 15 years.  When she goes abroad she prefers to travel by car. She prefers a tranquil life in a rural suburb south-west of Stockholm\, away from the noisy city atmosphere. Agnetha wrote these cover notes for My Colouring Book: The early impressions in life are etched with a particular strength and clarity.  That applies especially to music. So this album is a celebration of the music I heard yesterday.  A respectful homage to the artists who have inspired me and left deep prints in my soul and in my heart. This is the soundtrack of a time lost\, to which I return to\, with the mighty forces of music. I have enjoyed these songs all my life and they hold a special place in my heart. My effort was to recreate these songs with all respect for the originals.  My Colouring Book is my way of showing gratitude towards the songs\, the artists and all they have given me.  You are all deep within my heart and will stay there forever. To my family\, my friends\, to all listeners around the world and to everyone involved in this project - thank you for inspiring me to do this - I love you. Agnetha raises her voice dramatically for the third and fifth verses in this song\, to produce some of the most emotional singing I've ever heard.  She may be 53 here\, but as this picture shows\, Agnetha is still as beautiful as ever.    Words & Music by Fred Ebb & John Kander Originally recorded by Kitty Kallen in 1962.  Lyrics:   For those who fancy colouring books\, And lots of people do\, Here´s a new one for you\, A most unusual colouring book\,  The kind you never see\, Crayons ready very well\, Begin to colour me  These are the eyes that watched him\, As he walked away\, Colour them grey\,  This is the heart that thought\, He would always be true\, Colour it blue  These are the arms that held him\, And loved him then lost him somehow\, Oh... colour them empty now  These are the beads\, I wore until she came between\, Colour them green  This is the room that I sleep in\, And walk in\, and weep in\,  And hide in that nobody sees\,  Oh... colour it lonely please  This is the man\, Whose love I depended upon\, Colour him gone.	1

COL title VAL Misty Roses COL performer VAL Tim Hardin	COL video title VAL Grant Green_I Remember You COL channel name VAL rapitroy COL description VAL Personnel: Grant Green (guitar); Wilbur Ware (bass); Al Harewood (drums) (1961)  Producer: Alfred Lion.  Reissue producer: Michael Cuscuna.  Recorded at the Van Gelder Studio\, Englewood Cliffs\, New Jersey on August 29\, 1961. Includes liner notes by Pete Welding.  Digitally remastered using 20-bit technology by Ron McMaster.  Grant Green has always been somewhat neglected in the pantheon of jazz guitarists. Lacking the flash of Wes Montgomery and the cerebral intensity of Jim Hall\, his strengths tended to be overlooked\, but these strengths are well exhibited on STANDARDS.  Green brings a geometric simplicity to the melody of "You Stepped Out of a Dream\," his solos unfolding with more light than heat. On Gershwin's charming "Love Walked In\," his solo tumbles gently through the changes. He pauses to reflect on a note now and then\, giving the time elasticity and looseness rather than propulsion. Bassist Wilbur Ware is similarly underrated. It's hard to understand why--his pulse and sense of the architecture of a tune are without parallel. His rock-solid time on the ballad "If I Had You" shows why he was held in such high esteem by other musicians. Green and Ware work together like a pair of safecrackers\, each deftly anticipating and complementing the moves of the other\, while drummer Al Harewood keeps steady watch. This set of terse\, swinging jazz goes a long way towards fixing Grant Green's place in the jazz guitar firmament.	0

COL title VAL I Left My Heart in San Francisco COL performer VAL Nancy Wilson	COL video title VAL AC/DC Tribute - Sonny Hodge - Hells Bells COL channel name VAL Janahyna Flausino COL description VAL From the cd Backed in Black. Acoustic versions with female voices.  ---  Female acoustic versions of AC/DC songs? Yes\, it's a gimmick\, but it works on its own terms. And it's a sweet irony\, considering AC/DC's music has always been macho\, swaggering boys' anthems. So what happens when you put an army of Lilith Fair-ready female artists to these tunes? Something pretty good\, actually. In fact\, the best track on here is the opener\, Sunny Hodge's unbelievably sweet\, feminine "Hells Bells". The original\, with its spare\, ominous electric guitar riff and slow grinding groove\, is the last song I'd expected to work in this context\, but Hodge turns the riff into an almost primitive-blues acoustic riff while her thin\, sweet voice turns the cock-rock lyrics into something so bizarre\, you just have to grin. Single-name artist Patty does a good job turning "Highway to Hell" into a country-rock busking tune (I've sung that song with this arrangement\, myself)\, and Leslie King is also great on "You Shook Me All Night Long". "Back in Black"\, though\, suffers from cover artist Reyo Bikkin's inability to hit those Brian Johnson high notes on the chorus\, rendering those feral "Back in black!" hooks rather flaccid.  Strange and weirdly interesting. My big gripe is that\, excluding the two "bonus tracks" ending the disc ("Highway to Hell" and "For Those about to Rock")\, they did every song off the Back in Black album\, thus rendering the song selection very limited. Imagined if they'd had someone do "Rising Power"\, "Thunderstruck" or "Let There Be Rock" with an acoustic guitar and female vocals!   Review written by D.

COL title VAL Landslide COL performer VAL Mike Francis	COL video title VAL Creedence Clearwater Revival - Bad Moon Rising+Lyrics COL channel name VAL garin4x4 COL description VAL Creedence Clearwater Revival - Bad Moon Rising  Creedence Clearwater Revival seemed like something of an anomaly in the psychedelic 1960s. Far removed from the mind-expanding\, flower-power explorations of their California contemporaries\, they were a gritty\, hard-hitting band respectful of their blues\, country\, and rock & roll roots. John Fogerty's cutting\, raspy voice bore echoes of Howlin' Wolf and Little Richard as he delivered lyrics that alternately celebrated and bemoaned a working man's life. In a rare instance of art and commerce coinciding\, CCR's stream of hit singles made them one of the most successful '60s rock bands. The band broke up acrimoniously in the early '70s\, but Fogerty went on to a successful (if sporadic) solo career.	0

COL title VAL Play with Fire COL performer VAL The Beau Brummels	COL video title VAL 'Play With Fire' (originally by The Rolling Stones) new version by Crystal Jacqueline COL channel name VAL FruitsdeMer2 COL description VAL Crystal Jacqueline is new to the Fruits de Mer label but - ably assisted and orchestrated on this three-track 7" by Icarus Peel (with whom she also plays in the band The Honey Pot) -- she has a way with sixties psychedelia: from the dark & twisted to pure\, driving psych.  She takes two songs that I've been waiting for someone to cover since Fruits de Mer was still a winkle in someone's eye -- The Troggs' disturbed and disturbing  'Cousin Jane' and the long-lost Second Hand's 1968 classic 'A Fairy Tale' - and adds a carefully-crafted 'Play With Fire'\, previously recorded by the little-known rock combo\, The Rolling Stones. With a great production by Icarus Peel\, 'Play with Fire' is presented here - but only an excerpt (I want you to buy the vinyl!)  more details at www.fruitsdemerrecords.com	1

According to Velasquez\, the song was inspired by an aria from an opera by Enrique Granados\, a Spanish composer and pianist of classical music. Played by Trio Los Panchos\, whether this was the first version I'm not sure but I found this version is the best version I've ever heard so far\, particularly their outstanding guitar arrangement.  The lyric goes :  Bésame\, bésame mucho como si fuera esta noche la última vez\, bésame\, bésame mucho que tengo miedo perderte perderte después.  Quiero tenerte muy cerca mirarme en tus ojos y estar junto a ti\, piensa que tal vez mañana estaré muy lejos muy lejos de aquí\,   bésame\, bésame mucho como si fuera esta noche la última vez\, bésame\, bésame mucho que tengo miedo perderte perderte después  Enjoy !	0

Played by Trio Los Panchos\, whether this was the first version I'm not sure but I found this version is the best version I've ever heard so far\, particularly their outstanding guitar arrangement.  The lyric goes :  Bésame\, bésame mucho como si fuera esta noche la última vez\, bésame\, bésame mucho que tengo miedo perderte perderte después.  Quiero tenerte muy cerca mirarme en tus ojos y estar junto a ti\, piensa que tal vez mañana estaré muy lejos muy lejos de aquí\,   bésame\, bésame mucho como si fuera esta noche la última vez\, bésame\, bésame mucho que tengo miedo perderte perderte después  Enjoy !	0

COL title VAL 点都要爱 {Dim dou yiu oi} COL performer VAL Anita Mui	COL video title VAL Kay Starr -- You're Driving Me Crazy (What Did I Do?) COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Kay Star\, Su verdadero nombre es Katherine Laverne Starks y nació en Dougherty (Oklahoma) el 21 de julio de 1922   Joe Venuti\, la contrató para un show de música "hillbilly" y estuvo de gira con su banda por Menphis. De allí pasó a la orquesta de Bob Crosby\, el hermano de Bing Crosby\, con trabajos de una sola noche en distintas salas de baile. Tuvo la fortuna de que el show estaba patrocinado por la "Camel Caravan" y trasmitido por radio una vez al mes a toda América para que su voz fuese conocida y alcanzara enorme popularidad. Glenn Miller\, el famoso director de orquesta\, la contrató eventualmente en sustitución de su vocalista habitual\, la rubia\, Marion Hutton\, enferma y cansada tras incesantes y continuadas giras con la orquesta.  Con la orquesta de Miller\, realizo Kay Starr\, sus primeras grabaciones oficiales: "Baby Me" y "Love With a Capitol You" recogidas en el sello Bluebird en 1939. Después de terminados sus estudios escolares vuelve con Venuti antes de incorporarse a la formación de Charlie Barnet\, con quien volvió a entrar en los estudios de grabación en 1944 para grabar para los sellos "DECCA" y "V-Disc". Al año siguiente se decide a emprender su carrera en solitario formando parte de los "Capitol International Jazzmen"\, una especie de All Stars constituidos por Bill Coleman\, Buster Bailey\, Benny Carter\, Coleman Hawkins\, Nat King Cole\, Oscar Moore\, John Kirby y Max Roach. Su vivacidad en el escenario y su canto\, alegre y desenfadado recordaba algunas veces a Ella Fitzgerald y en absoluto desentonó en compañía de tan ilustres músicos. Tras la II Guerra Mundial\, Los Ángeles era un hervidero musical y números sellos fueron tras sus pasos para que grabara en distintos espacios y formatos musicales.  En 1947\, Dave Dexter\, la incorporó a Capitol hecho que marca el principio de su carrera de éxitos. Sus temas más populares fueron "Wheel Of Fortune" y "Rock And Roll Waltz". Sin embargo\, hubo que esperar hasta su segunda vuelta a este sello en 1959\, para que Kay Starr abordase un repertorio a su altura en contextos de índole jazzsiticos. Sus álbumes "Movin" (Capitol\, 1959); "Movin' On Broadway" y "The Jazz Singer" ambos para Capitol en 1960\, y los tres con la orquesta de Van Alexander\, o el selecto disco "I Cry by Night"\, que cierra el ciclo Capitol en 1961\, y grabado en pequeña formación con Ben Webster y Lee Young\, entre otros instrumentistas\, son su testamento musical.  Estos éxitos jazzisticos tardíos\, la reconciliaban absolutamente con sus seguidores y la confirmaban como una cantante admirable aunque desgraciadamente demasiada cicatera con el jazz. Kay Starr\, siguió mas o menos activa hasta finales de los años ochenta donde ya se retiró.

Join our Youtube: https://goo.gl/8AOGaN Join our Facebook: http://goo.gl/5oL723  Buy on Google Play: goo.gl/nt2FtY  Nina Simone (born Eunice Kathleen Waymon; February 21\, 1933 – April 21\, 2003) was an American singer\, songwriter\, pianist\, arranger\, and civil rights activist who worked in a broad range of musical styles including classical\, jazz\, blues\, folk\, R&B\, gospel\, and pop. Born in North Carolina\, the sixth child of a preacher\, Simone aspired to be a concert pianist. With the help of the few supporters in her hometown of Tryon\, North Carolina\, she enrolled in the Juilliard School of Music in New York. Waymon then applied for a scholarship to study at the prestigious Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia\, where she was denied despite a well-received audition. Simone became fully convinced this rejection had been entirely due to her race\, a statement that has been a matter of controversy. Years later\, two days before her death\, the Curtis Institute of Music bestowed an honorary degree on Simone. To make a living\, Eunice Waymon changed her name to "Nina Simone". The change related to her need to disguise herself from family members\, having chosen to play "the devil's music" or "cocktail piano" at a nightclub in Atlantic City. She was told in the nightclub that she would have to sing to her own accompaniment\, and this effectively launched her career as a jazz vocalist. Simone recorded more than forty albums\, mostly between 1958\, when she made her debut with Little Girl Blue\, and 1974\, and had a hit in the United States in 1958 with "I Loves You\, Porgy". Simone's musical style fused gospel and pop with classical music\, in particular Johann Sebastian Bach\, and accompanied expressive\, jazz-like singing in her contralto voice. To fund her private lessons\, Simone performed at the Midtown Bar & Grill on Pacific Avenue in Atlantic City\, whose owner insisted that she sing as well as play the piano\, which increased her weekly income to $90 a week. In 1954\, she adopted the stage name "Nina Simone". "Nina" (from niña\, meaning "little girl" in Spanish)\, and "Simone" was taken from the French actress Simone Signoret\, whom she had seen in the movie Casque d'Or. Knowing her mother would not approve of playing the "Devil's Music"\, she used her new stage name to remain undetected. Simone's mixture of jazz\, blues\, and classical music in her performances at the bar earned her a small but loyal fan base. In 1958\, she befriended and married Don Ross\, a beatnik who worked as a fairground barker\, but quickly regretted their marriage. Playing in small clubs in the same year\, she recorded George Gershwin's "I Loves You\, Porgy" (from Porgy and Bess)\, which she learned from a Billie Holiday album and performed as a favor to a friend. It became her only Billboard top 20 success in the United States\, and her debut album Little Girl Blue soon followed on Bethlehem Records. Simone lost more than $1 million in royalties (notably for the 1980s re-release of My Baby Just Cares for Me) and never benefited financially from the album's sales because she had sold her rights outright for $3\,000. After the success of Little Girl Blue\, Simone signed a contract with Colpix Records and recorded a multitude of studio and live albums. Colpix relinquished all creative control to her\, including the choice of material that would be recorded\, in exchange for her signing the contract with them. After the release of her live album Nina Simone at Town Hall\, Simone became a favorite performer in Greenwich Village. By this time\, Simone performed pop music only to make money to continue her classical music studies and was indifferent about having a recording contract. She kept this attitude toward the record industry for most of her career. Simone married a New York police detective\, Andrew Stroud\, in 1961. He later became her manager and the father of her daughter Lisa\, but he abused Simone psychologically and physically. FROM WIKIPEDIA: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina_Simone	1

COL title VAL When I Fall in Love COL performer VAL Della Reese	COL video title VAL Carlos Gardel - El Día Que Me Quieras (escena completa) - Audio Excelente COL channel name VAL calioff COL description VAL Alfredo Le Pera\, además de admirar la poesía del nayarita Amado Nervo\, era letrista y guionista del actor\, cantante y compositor argentino\, Carlos Gardel.   Lepera retomó la idea de la poesía de Nervo  y mediante el recurso de la paráfrasis\, realizó una nueva creación.   La letra del poema fue musicalizada por Carlos Gardel y el director de orquesta\, violinista y compositor de tangos\, el argentino Terig Tucci\, se hizo cargo de los arreglos musicales. El 19 de marzo de 1935 fue grabada en Nueva York y utilizada como tema de la película del mismo nombre\, dirigida por John Reinhardt.  El texto musicalizado quedó así:  Acaricia mi ensueño el suave murmullo de tu suspirar. ¡Como ríe la vida si tus ojos negros me quieren mirar! Y si es mío el amparo de tu risa leve que es como un cantar\, ella aquieta mi herida\, ¡todo\, todo se olvida..! El día que me quieras la rosa que engalana se vestirá de fiesta con su mejor color. Al viento las campanas dirán que ya eres mía y locas las fontanas me contarán tu amor. La noche que me quieras desde el azul del cielo\, las estrellas celosas nos mirarán pasar y un rayo misterioso hará nido en tu pelo\, luciérnaga curiosa que verá...¡que eres mi consuelo..!  En la versión cantada por Carlos Gardel\, él recita: El día que me quieras no habrá más que armonías\, será clara la aurora y alegre el manantial. Traerá quieta la brisa rumor de melodías y nos darán las fuentes su canto de cristal. El día que me quieras endulzará sus cuerdas el pájaro cantor\, florecerá la vida\, no existirá el dolor...  Para enseguida\, en la película\, continuar cantándola\, ahora a dúo con Rosita Montero:  La noche que me quieras desde el azul del cielo\, las estrellas celosas nos mirarán pasar y un rayo misterioso hará nido en tu pelo\, luciérnaga curiosa que verá... ¡que eres mi consuelo!  "El día que me quieras" poema del autor Méxicano Amado Nervo se publicó en 1922 en el libro El Arquero Divino:  El día que me quieras tendrá más luz que junio; la noche que me quieras será de plenilunio\, como notas de Bethoveen vibrando en cada rayo sus inefables cosas\, y habrá juntas más rosas que en todo el mes de mayo. Las fuentes cristalinas irán por las laderas saltando cantarinas\, el día que me quieras. El día que me quieras\, los sotos escondidos resonarán arpegios nunca jamás oídos. Éxtasis de tus ojos\, todas las primaveras que hubo y habrá en el mundo\, serán cuando me quieras. Cogidas de la mano\, cual rubias hermanitas luciendo golas cándidas\, irán las margaritas por montes y praderas delante de tus pasos\, el día que me quieras... Y si deshojas una\, te dirá su inocente postrer pétalo blanco: "¡Apasionadamente!" Al reventar el alba del día que me quieras\, tendrán todos los tréboles cuatro hojas agoreras\, y en el estanque\, nido de gérmenes ignotos\, florecerán las místicas corolas de los lotos. El día que me quieras será cada celaje ala maravillosa\, cada arrebol miraje de las Mil y Una Noches\, cada brisa un cantar\, cada árbol una lira\, cada monte un altar. El día que me quieras\, para nosotros dos cabrá en un solo beso la beatitud de "Dios".  aporte de "Carlos Tango DJ" http://carlostangodj.com & Cantando Tangos https://www.youtube.com/user/cantandotangos	0

She takes two songs that I've been waiting for someone to cover since Fruits de Mer was still a winkle in someone's eye -- The Troggs' disturbed and disturbing  'Cousin Jane' and the long-lost Second Hand's 1968 classic 'A Fairy Tale' - and adds a carefully-crafted 'Play With Fire'\, previously recorded by the little-known rock combo\, The Rolling Stones.

Join our Youtube: https://goo.gl/8AOGaN Join our Facebook: http://goo.gl/5oL723  Buy on Google Play: goo.gl/nt2FtY  Nina Simone (born Eunice Kathleen Waymon; February 21\, 1933 – April 21\, 2003) was an American singer\, songwriter\, pianist\, arranger\, and civil rights activist who worked in a broad range of musical styles including classical\, jazz\, blues\, folk\, R&B\, gospel\, and pop. Born in North Carolina\, the sixth child of a preacher\, Simone aspired to be a concert pianist. With the help of the few supporters in her hometown of Tryon\, North Carolina\, she enrolled in the Juilliard School of Music in New York. Waymon then applied for a scholarship to study at the prestigious Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia\, where she was denied despite a well-received audition. Simone became fully convinced this rejection had been entirely due to her race\, a statement that has been a matter of controversy. Years later\, two days before her death\, the Curtis Institute of Music bestowed an honorary degree on Simone. To make a living\, Eunice Waymon changed her name to "Nina Simone". The change related to her need to disguise herself from family members\, having chosen to play "the devil's music" or "cocktail piano" at a nightclub in Atlantic City. She was told in the nightclub that she would have to sing to her own accompaniment\, and this effectively launched her career as a jazz vocalist. Simone recorded more than forty albums\, mostly between 1958\, when she made her debut with Little Girl Blue\, and 1974\, and had a hit in the United States in 1958 with "I Loves You\, Porgy". Simone's musical style fused gospel and pop with classical music\, in particular Johann Sebastian Bach\, and accompanied expressive\, jazz-like singing in her contralto voice. To fund her private lessons\, Simone performed at the Midtown Bar & Grill on Pacific Avenue in Atlantic City\, whose owner insisted that she sing as well as play the piano\, which increased her weekly income to $90 a week. In 1954\, she adopted the stage name "Nina Simone". "Nina" (from niña\, meaning "little girl" in Spanish)\, and "Simone" was taken from the French actress Simone Signoret\, whom she had seen in the movie Casque d'Or. Knowing her mother would not approve of playing the "Devil's Music"\, she used her new stage name to remain undetected. Simone's mixture of jazz\, blues\, and classical music in her performances at the bar earned her a small but loyal fan base. In 1958\, she befriended and married Don Ross\, a beatnik who worked as a fairground barker\, but quickly regretted their marriage. Playing in small clubs in the same year\, she recorded George Gershwin's "I Loves You\, Porgy" (from Porgy and Bess)\, which she learned from a Billie Holiday album and performed as a favor to a friend. It became her only Billboard top 20 success in the United States\, and her debut album Little Girl Blue soon followed on Bethlehem Records. Simone lost more than $1 million in royalties (notably for the 1980s re-release of My Baby Just Cares for Me) and never benefited financially from the album's sales because she had sold her rights outright for $3\,000. After the success of Little Girl Blue\, Simone signed a contract with Colpix Records and recorded a multitude of studio and live albums. Colpix relinquished all creative control to her\, including the choice of material that would be recorded\, in exchange for her signing the contract with them. After the release of her live album Nina Simone at Town Hall\, Simone became a favorite performer in Greenwich Village. By this time\, Simone performed pop music only to make money to continue her classical music studies and was indifferent about having a recording contract. She kept this attitude toward the record industry for most of her career. Simone married a New York police detective\, Andrew Stroud\, in 1961. He later became her manager and the father of her daughter Lisa\, but he abused Simone psychologically and physically. FROM WIKIPEDIA: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina_Simone	0

COL description VAL Recorded in 1952 with "Heart and Soul" on the flipside. A pair of Philadelphia boys\, Al Alberts and Dave Mahoney\, finding themselves in the North Atlantic in the Navy in WWII\, killed time by singing together. Joining two more local boys\, Rosario and Louis\, they formed the Four Aces\, following in the footsteps of the Ames Brothers. Their first hit was "(It's No) Sin\," which was shopped to no avail to New York record companies\, and finally released by Al\, who started his own record company\, Victoria Records\, to do it. The song peaked on Billboard's charts at #4 in 1951\, and the Aces were quickly signed by Decca. The group-written "Tell Me Why\," "A Garden in the Rain\," "Perfidia\," "I'm Yours" and "Heart and Soul" were next to climb high on the charts. Appearing frequently on TV\, Aces singles "La Rosita\," "Just Squeeze Me\," "Laughing on the Outside" and "The Gang that Sang (Heart of My Heart)" were among 8 of the group's hits in 1952. "Stranger in Paradise" went to #2 on the charts\, which the Aces finally topped with the theme from the movie "Three Coins in a Fountain." Popular hits "Dream" and "So Long\," followed\, and "Mr. Sandman" and "Melody of Love" scored in Billboard's top five before the floodgates of Rock 'n Roll opened in 1955\, and even that year the Aces had another chart-topper with "Love is a Many Splendored Thing."	0

"After You've Gone" was recorded on their first session for the label and there seems to have been some growing pains. The balance is not as good as on the other labels\, with especially weak recording of the bass.  The opening chorus is by Grappelli this time around and he is immediately followed by the Louis Armstrong-inspired singing of Freddie Taylor. It seems that everyone is holding back in these opening choruses\, and sure enough\, as soon as Taylor is finished\, the intensity goes up as Django goes into a finger-busting chorus filled with fast arpeggios and runs\, and concluding with a chorded intro to Grappelli. The violinist takes charge\, building the intensity with every chorus. The breaks\, built into the tune at the end of each 16-bar section\, seem to have little effect on Taylor\, but each time Reinhardt and Grappelli hit them\, they add to the growing excitement of the recording.   1936 May 4 - Gramophone\, Paris	0

Etta Jones was an American jazz singer whose critical success and relative commercial obscurity earned her a reputation in her lifetime as a "jazz musician's jazz singer". A highly underrated singer who rarely received the recognition she richly deserved\, perhaps the salient mark of her obscurity was the number of times even followers of the female jazz vocal scene would confuse her with a more popular singer\, Etta James. Etta Jones is noted for her elegant interpretations of standards\, ballads\, and blues. Her characteristic inflections have sometimes prompted comparisons to stylistic devices employed by Billie Holiday and Dinah Washington.  Etta's accompanied by Frank Wess\, (flute\, tenor saxophone)\, Richard Wyands\, (piano)\, Skeeter Best (guitar)\,  George Duvivier (bass) and Roy Haynes (drums).  Recorded June 21\, 1960. (Prestige Records)  Build your dreams to the stars above But when you need someone true to love Don't go to strangers\, darling\, come on to me  Play with fire 'til your fingers burn And when there's no place for you to turn Don't go to strangers\, darling\, come on to me  For\, when you hear a call to follow your heart You follow your heart\, I know I've been through it all and I'm an old hand And I'll understand if you go  So make your mark for your friends to see But when you need more than company Don't go to strangers\, come on to me  Oh\, make your mark for your friends to see But when you need more than company Don't go to strangers\, darling\, come on to me	0

COL title VAL Sometimes When We Touch COL performer VAL Dan Hill	COL video title VAL Nat King Cole With The George Shearing Quintet & String Choir - Lost April (Capitol Records 1961) COL channel name VAL RoundMidnightTV COL description VAL "Lost April" is a song written by Eddie Delange\, Emil Newman & Herbert Spencer.  Nathaniel Adams Coles (March 17\, 1919 -- February 15\, 1965)\, known professionally as Nat King Cole\, was an American musician who first came to prominence as a leading jazz pianist. Although an accomplished pianist\, he owes most of his popular musical fame to his soft baritone voice\, which he used to perform in big band and jazz genres. He was one of the first black Americans to host a television variety show\, and has maintained worldwide popularity since his death.  RIP "The Serene Poet of Jazz" George Shearing\, we lost you today (February 14\, 2011) on Valentines Day... you will be missed and we shall remember and celebrate your music forever.  Thanks for gracing us with your musical presence. Nat & George in heaven playing and singing wonderful music together once again!  Nat's accompanied by Victor Arno\, Israel Baker\, Harold Dicterow\, Dave Frisina\, Jack Gasselin\, James Getzoff\, Erno Neufeld\, Isadore Roman\, Felix Slatkin\, Albert Steinberg\, Jerry Vinci (violin); Alvin Dinkin\, Al Harshman\, Virginia Majewski\, Paul Robyn (viola); Hyman Gold\, Armand Kaproff\, Kurt Reher\, Eleanor Slatkin (cello); Warren Chiasson\, Emil Richards (vibraphone); George Shearing (piano); Al Hendrickson (guitar); Israel Crosby\, Al McKibbon (bass); Mike Rubin (arco bass); Vernell Fournier\, Shelly Manne (drums); Armando Peraza (congas); and Ralph Carmichael (arranger\, conductor).  Recorded in Capitol Studios\, Hollywood\, CA\, December 22\, 1961.  (Capitol Records)  Lost April\, Where did you go? Like winter's snow\, I saw you vanish. Lost April\, So soft and warm. A memory  Not even time can banish.  Lost April\, That taught me this. A single kiss Could lead to heaven. But April had numbered days\, So when they passed\,  Love couldn't last. I lost love and you\, And April\, too.  [Interlude]  So when they passed\, Love couldn't last.  I lost love and you\,  And April\, too.	0

COL title VAL Over the Rainbow COL performer VAL Red Garland	COL video title VAL an "OVER THE RAINBOW" like no other -- by vocalist  EMILY HADDAD COL channel name VAL TheMotiondevotion COL description VAL Emily's 1991 CD (now out-of-print) can be purchased HERE: http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=372565620256  "Over the Rainbow" is one of the most well-loved and widely-known tunes of all time and of course much of that can be attributed to Judy Garland's performance in  "The Wizard of Oz".  The version you're hearing here includes the introductory verse that was dispensed with in the movie\, an unfortunate omission because it really sets the tone for the main verse and its absence is contrary to what Harold Arlen intended in 1939 when he composed this song that will live forever.  The interpretation of  "Over the Rainbow" on this CD has a modernized slant that was dreamed up by Emily\, her father Habib and their team of creative Chicagoans. This is just an excerpt of a song that lasts for five minutes & twenty seconds. Later in this tune she takes a scat solo that will uplift you and make any Monday tolerable.   Watch the adjoining clips on this YouTube channel and you'll understand the reason for Emily's rapid ascendance from the local to the national scene. Actually\, the INTERNATIONAL scene where she sang on the summer jazz festival circuit in Europe.  Emily made her performance debut in 1987 at age five. A year later while doing the European jazz festival circuit she crossed paths with Dizzy Gillespie who immediately noticed the nature of her gift and became a friend and mentor to both Emily and her father\, guitarist Habib Haddad. Dizzy appeared as a guest soloist at some of Emily's jazz festival concerts\, had her as guest vocalist with his big band and readily agreed to be on this CD (when she was a seasoned 8-year-old)\,    Emily had an uncanny knack for scatting through chord changes in the most pure and intuitive manner. For example\, hear Dizzy & Emily trading eights on "Bye Bye Blackbird" from her CD debut HERE:  http://youtu.be/0FNTkXBjxpM  Here's Emily in performance at the Gold Star Sardine Bar: http://youtu.be/uPGDKMloogQ   Here's the TV news coverage of her Sardine Bar appearance: http://youtu.be/zar6dd6uxK8  Here's Emily being interviewed on the Geraldo Rivera show: http://youtu.be/OFpwUfjOta0   Here she is as a 10-year-old in performance at Chicago's legendary Green Mill nightclub:  http://youtu.be/6oHLmWAzcf8  And this is a news segment on that Green Mill appearance: http://youtu.be/uUPjc_voNZo  NOTE: This YouTube channel is Chicago-based.

COL title VAL Loving Arms COL performer VAL Livingston Taylor with Leah Kunkel	COL video title VAL Billy Eckstine -- If Ever I Would Leave You COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Billy Eckstine (Pittsburgh\, 8 de julio de 1914 - Pittsburgh\, 8 de marzo de 1993) fue un cantante estadounidense de jazz y música pop. Poseedor de una voz de barítono\, fue durante los años cuarenta una figura carismática de la música popular negra\, al liderar una de las primeras big band de bop y convertirse en el primer cantante negro de baladas románticas (fue llamado el Sinatra negro). Con el paso de los años\, su influencia ha sido considerable en el ámbito del soul y el rhythm and blues.  Eckstine comenzó a cantar a los nueve años y participó en numerosos espectáculos para aficionados. Aunque su vocación había sido la de jugador de fútbol americano\, una grave lesión lo recondujo hacia el mundo de la música. Tras diversos trabajos al oeste de Chicago a finales de los años treinta\, Eckstine fue invitado por Earl Hines para unirse a su Grand Terrace Orchestra en 1939.  Aunque sus primeros éxitos fueron canciones triviales como "Jelly\, Jelly" y "The Jitney Man"\, grabó también varios estándares como "Stormy Monday". Hacia 1943\, se acompañaba de estrellas como Dizzy Gillespie\, Charlie Parker y Sarah Vaughan. Tras formar su propia banda ese año\, contrató a los tres y gradualmente se hizo con más figuras modernas y con futuras estrellas: Wardell Gray\, Dexter Gordon\, Miles Davis\, Kenny Dorham\, Fats Navarro y Art Blakey\, así como con arreglistas como Tadd Dameron y Gil Fuller. La Billy Eckstine Orchestra fue la primera big band bop\, y su líder reflejaba las innovaciones bop adaptando sus armonías vocales a las baladas normales. A pesar del matiz moderno del grupo\, Eckstine encabezó las listas frecuentemente a mediados de los cuarenta\, con temas como "A Cottage for Sale" y "Prisoner of Love". En las giras por Europa y América\, el cantante tocaba también la trompeta\, el trombón de válvulas y la guitarra.  Forzado a disolver la orquesta en 1947 tras haber formado la suya propia Gillespie\, Eckstine realizó una transición hacia un estilo más baladístico y con arreglos de cuerda. Grabó más de una docena de éxitos a finales de los cuarenta\, entre lo que se incluyen "My Foolish Heart" y "I Apologize". Se hizo popular en Gran Bretaña\, obteniendo un gran éxito durante los cincuenta con temas como "No One But You" y "Gigi"\, así como con sus dúos con Sarah Vaughan. Eckstine regresaría a sus raíces jazzísticas ocasionalmente\, grabando con Vaughan\, Count Basie y Quincy Jones\, y grabando un LP en directo\, No Cover\, No Minimum\, en el que interpretaba algunos solos de trompeta. Grabó varios discos para Mercury y Roulette a comienzos de los sesenta y publicó en Motown algunos discos de estándares a mediados de esa década. Tras grabar muy espaciadamente en los setenta\, Eckstine hizo su última grabación (Billy Eckstine Sings with Benny Carter) en 1986. Murió por un ataque al corazón en 1993.

COL title VAL You Belong to Me COL performer VAL Jaimee Paul	COL video title VAL Mandy - barry manilow COL channel name VAL kaattz COL description VAL Barry Manilow (born June 17\, 1943) is an American singer-songwriter\, musician\, arranger\, producer and conductor\, best known for such recordings as "I Write the Songs"\, "Mandy"\, "Weekend in New England" and "Copacabana". Manilow's achievements include sales of more than 76 million records worldwide. In 1978\, five of his albums were on the best-selling charts simultaneously\, a feat equalled only by Frank Sinatra\, Michael Jackson and Johnny Mathis. He has recorded a string of Billboard hit singles and multi-platinum albums that have resulted in his being named Radio & Records number one Adult Contemporary artist and winning three straight American Music Awards for Favourite Pop/Rock Male Artist. Several well-known entertainers have given Manilow their "stamp of approval\," including Sinatra\, who was quoted in the 1970s regarding Manilow\, "He's next." In 1988\, Bob Dylan stopped Manilow at a party\, hugged him and said\, "Don't stop what you're doing\, man. We're all inspired by you." Arsenio Hall cited Manilow as a favourite guest on The Arsenio Hall Show and admonished his audience to respect him for his work.   LYRICS: I remember all my life rainin' down as cold as ice Shadows of a man a face through a window Cryin' in the night the night goes into morning. Just another day  happy people pass my way Looking in their eyes I see a memory I never realized how happy you made me. Oh Mandy well you came and you gave without taking But I sent you away oh Mandy Well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking And I need you today oh Mandy. I'm standing on the edge of time I've walked away when love was mine Caught up in a world of up-hill climbing The tears are in my mind and nothing is rhyming. Oh Mandy well you came and you gave without taking Yesterday's a dream-l face the morning Crying on a breeze the pain is calling Oh Mandy well you came and you gave without taking	0

COL title VAL Someone to Watch over Me COL performer VAL Ray Charles	COL video title VAL Elaine Stritch -- You Took Advantage of Me COL channel name VAL OldieMusicMan COL description VAL This is my favorite performance of "You Took Advantage of Me" out there. Even compared to other renditions of the same song by other powerhouse vocalists like Anita O'Day\, Bobby Short\, and my favorite jazz vocalist ever\, Ella Fitzgerald\, Elaine Stritch's remains my favorite. (My second favorite version is Judy Garland's performance in her "Born in a Trunk" medley; sadly\, it is disconnected\, not a through-and-through like it should have been). Her brassy\, throaty\, mostly straight-toned vocals seem those for which this song works best.  I hate that Elaine Stritch's voice has suffered as it has through time\, thanks to booze and cigarettes. In her prime\, she was as good a singer as anyone out there\, and ten times as unique. "C'est la vie" as our friends in France might say. We still have recordings like this to prove that\, at some point\, she WAS a singer.  ** I DO NOT OWN THE COPYRIGHT TO THIS RECORDING.

While its instrumental version is simply known as "The Godfather Love Theme"\, "Speak Softly Love" is the vocal version. The words are by Larry Kusik but the music itself is by Nino Rota. The signature musical theme that opens the piece closely models a theme that appears early in "Preludio - Povero Ernesto!" in the opera Don Pasquale by Gaetano Donizetti (1797-1848). A similar melody also appears in the Overture to "La Forza del Destino" by Giuseppe Verdi (1813-1901). There are also different sets of lyrics for the song in Italian ("Parla Più Piano") and also in Sicilian ("Brucia La Terra"). The Sicilian version is sung by Anthony Corleone (Franc D'Ambrosio) in The Godfather Part III.  Rota had used a more comedic version of the song for the 1958 film Fortunella. When this was discovered\, Rota's score for The Godfather was disqualified from consideration at the 1973 Academy Awards; it had been nominated for Best Original Score. However\, Rota's score for The Godfather Part II won the 1974 Academy Award for Best Original Score\, despite containing the same piece.  Recordings  The song was originally recorded by Andy Williams. Other artists\, such as Al Martino\, Eric Clapton and Bobby Vinton\, have also recorded the song\, among many others:  Slash regularly performs it in concerts in a rock style. Ken Boothe recorded a reggae version. Sergio Franchi recorded the theme song his 1976 DynaHouse album 20 Magnificent Songs. Satan's Pilgrims have performed a surf version as well. Harry Connick Jr. recorded it under the title "Parle Plus Bas". Gianni Morandi had covered the song under the title "Parla Più Piano". Dalida\, Tino Rossi\, Marie Laforêt\, and the Puppini Sisters covered the song under the title "Parle Plus Bas". A Ukrainian version\, "Say You Love Me" (Ukrainian: Скажи\, що любиш; Skazhy scho lyubysh) was performed by Sofia Rotaru in the musical film Song Is Always with Us. The Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra has also performed a ska version of the song. The song was also sampled for a song\, "Raja ko rani se pyar ho gaya" in the Indian film Akele Hum Akele Tum. In Yugoslavia it was adapted and sung by Tereza Kesovija as "Govori Tiše". Hungarian pop star György Korda released the Hungarian language version 1974 as "Gyöngéden ölelj át és ringass szerelem". Candies performed this song live in Osaka in 1977. Fantômas also recorded a metal version of the song on their album The Director's Cut. The Hot Club of Detroit recorded a Gypsy jazz cover of this song on their eponymous album. The Sicilian version from The Godfather Part III appears on the music compilation Mob Hits: the Best Songs of Mafia Movies. Speak Softly Love\, recorded in 2004 by the Norwegian singer Rein Alexander. The melody was used as the theme music and as a central plot device in the Soviet short animated film Contact. A Slovak version was done by František Krištof Veselý\, and a Czech version by Jiří Malásek. Scott Walker recorded a version for his 1972 album The Moviegoer. A Portuguese version called "Fale Baixinho" was recorded by Brazilian singer Wanderley Cardoso in 1972. German jazz pianist Wolfgang Liebert regularly performs it as a standard. Hip-hop artist RZA of Wu-Tang Clan samples the theme in "Black Mozart" on Raekwon's album Only Built 4 Cuban Linx II. The Italian version ("Parla Piu Piano"\, or "Io e Te") was recorded by Johnny Dorelli in 1973 . Dominic Chianese\, who portrayed Johnny Ola in The Godfather Part II\, recorded the Italian version for his album Ungrateful Heart. Mac Dre sampled the theme in his hip-hop song "Mafioso" from his 2003 album\, Al Boo Boo. Parle Plus Bas\, recorded in 2008 by French singer Patrick Fiori for his album Les Choses de La Vie. Rosenberg Trio recorded a version of this song on their 1992 album\, Impressions. The song was covered by several Hong Kong singers\, Frances Yip (葉麗儀) in 1972\, Irene Ryder (黎愛蓮) in 1973\, Juliana Luok (陸小雅) on her LP album Killing Me Softly\, and also\, by Singaporean singer Ling Ying (林櫻) on her LP album The Best Of Lin Ying & The Prinstar Punchers in 1972.	0

Manilow's achievements include sales of more than 76 million records worldwide. In 1978\, five of his albums were on the best-selling charts simultaneously\, a feat equalled only by Frank Sinatra\, Michael Jackson and Johnny Mathis. He has recorded a string of Billboard hit singles and multi-platinum albums that have resulted in his being named Radio & Records number one Adult Contemporary artist and winning three straight American Music Awards for Favourite Pop/Rock Male Artist.

In 1988\, Bob Dylan stopped Manilow at a party\, hugged him and said\, "Don't stop what you're doing\, man. We're all inspired by you." Arsenio Hall cited Manilow as a favourite guest on The Arsenio Hall Show and admonished his audience to respect him for his work.

Just another day  happy people pass my way Looking in their eyes I see a memory I never realized how happy you made me. Oh Mandy well you came and you gave without taking But I sent you away oh Mandy Well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking And I need you today oh Mandy. I'm standing on the edge of time I've walked away when love was mine Caught up in a world of up-hill climbing The tears are in my mind and nothing is rhyming. Oh Mandy well you came and you gave without taking Yesterday's a dream-l face the morning Crying on a breeze the pain is calling Oh Mandy well you came and you gave without taking	0

COL title VAL Dardanella COL performer VAL The Three Suns	COL video title VAL Elvis Presley - Money Honey COL channel name VAL Music Legends Book COL description VAL Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8\, 1935 – August 16\, 1977) was an American singer and actor. Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century\, he is often referred to as "the King of Rock and Roll"\, or simply\, "the King". Presley was born in Tupelo\, Mississippi as a twinless twin\, and when he was 13 years old\, he and his family relocated to Memphis\, Tennessee. His music career began there in 1954\, when he recorded a song with producer Sam Phillips at Sun Records. Accompanied by guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black\, Presley was an early popularizer of rockabilly\, an uptempo\, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker\, who managed the singer for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single\, "Heartbreak Hotel"\, was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. He was regarded as the leading figure of rock and roll after a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style\, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines that coincided with the dawn of the Civil Rights Movement\, made him enormously popular and controversial. In November 1956\, he made his film debut in Love Me Tender. In 1958\, he was drafted into military service. He resumed his recording career two years later\, producing some of his most commercially successful work before devoting much of the 1960s to making Hollywood movies and their accompanying soundtrack albums\, most of which were critically derided. In 1968\, following a seven-year break from live performances\, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed televised comeback special Elvis\, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973\, Presley was featured in the first globally broadcast concert via satellite\, Aloha from Hawaii. Several years of prescription drug abuse severely damaged his health\, and he died in 1977 at the age of 42. Presley is one of the most celebrated and influential musicians of the 20th century. Commercially successful in many genres\, including pop\, blues and gospel\, he is the best-selling solo artist in the history of recorded music\, with estimated record sales of around 600 million units worldwide. He won three Grammys\, also receiving the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36\, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame. Forbes named Elvis Presley as the 2nd top earning dead celebrity with $55 million as of 2011.	0
COL title VAL You've Got Personality COL performer VAL 4 Lads	COL video title VAL Mitch Ryder - You've Got Personality & Chantilly Lace (1968) COL channel name VAL menchitty11 COL description VAL Detroit's Mitch Ryder had 6 songs to hit the Top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100\, with his biggest selling single\, the medley of "Devil With A Blue Dress/Good Golly Miss Molly"\, peaked at #4 in 1966. Ryder released another medley song in 1968; "("You've Got) Personality/Chantilly Lace"\, originally done respectively by Lee Price and The Big Bopper. The single didn't fare well on the Hot 100\, only got as high as #87\, and became Ryder's final Hot 100 entry....until 1983\, when he released a cover of Prince's "When You We're Mine". Unfortunately\, that single also reached #87! "Personality/Chantilly Lace" deserved a better chart fate\, because it still captures the raw-ness of Ryder's vocals and hard-rocking rhythm.	1

Vivent les chansons pour les Bien-aimées. Je me souviens d'elle au sang de velours. Elle avait des mains qui parlaient d'amour Et tressait l'argile avec les nuages Et pressait le vent contre son visage Pour en exprimer l'huile des voyages.  {Refrain}  "Adieu mon Paris"\, dit le chevalier. "J'ai dormi cent ans\, debout sans manger Les pommes d'argent de mes doux pommiers."

COL title VAL I Can Tell COL performer VAL The Searchers	COL video title VAL WHEN I TAKE MY SUGAR TO TEA (1947) by the Nat King Cole Trio COL channel name VAL wilson mcphert COL description VAL Early in his career\, Nat King Cole started a ground breaking trio in 1937\, playing piano with Oscar Moore on guitar and Wesley Prince on bass. This version of the King Cole Trio (as it was known) played a mixture of novelty songs\, jazz and pop tunes\, often with unison singing from all three members\, as well as Nat's lead vocal.   When Prince was drafted\, Johnny Miller took over on bass in 1942\, and by this time\, Nat's voice was more to the fore\, and there were less novelty songs. The melody to this song was written by Sammy Fain\, and the lyrics by Irving Kahal and Pierre Norman in 1931. It was released by the trio in 1947\, and later that same year Oscar Moore left to be replaced by Irving Ashby. The trio kept going until Nat's career really took off with singing ballads backed mainly by orchestras. At this point\, Nat was not playing much piano\, which was a pity\, as he was a really hot and infuential jazz pianist.   I have put a slide show video together using as many images of this version of the trio that I could find. Comments are welcome.	0

Clover released two country-rock albums before changing their sound to something closer to pub rock\, whereupon Nick Lowe heard them\, really liked them\, and hooked them up with Jake Riviera and Elvis Costello\, which led to several members backing Elvis on My Aim Is True and two excellent albums on the Vertigo label.  However\, what Clover has become most famous for is featuring a lead singer/harmonica player by the name of Huey Lewis\, who of course went on to great fame in the '80s and beyond.  I really love this cover of The Ricky Nelson hit; it shows off just how tight Clover was\, and how amazing their vocals were!	0

COL title VAL Superstition COL performer VAL Widespread Panic featuring The Dirty Dozen Brass Band	COL video title VAL The Flames - Try a little tenderness COL channel name VAL keurspel (Leon Rossouw) COL description VAL The Flames was a musical group from Durban in South Africa. The band was originally formed in 1963 by guitarist Steve Fataar\, bassist Brother Fataar (real name Edries Fataar)\, drummer George Faber and guitarist Eugene Champion. However\, this line-up would only be together to record a couple of songs. Ricky Fataar replaced George Faber as the band's drummer around 1964 and Edries Fredericks replaced Eugene Champion as the guitarist. Baby Duval briefly replaced Edries Fredericks in 1967. Blondie Chaplin then replaced Baby Duval in 1967. This was to be the line-up from 1967 until their demise as a group in 1970. In 1972 Ricky Fataar and Blondie Chaplin joined The Beach Boys.  This song is off the album "Soulfire!!" released in 1968. It was written by Jimmy Campbell\, Reg Connelly and Harry M. Woods\, and recorded initially on December 8\, 1932 by the Ray Noble Orchestra (with vocals by Val Rosing)\, followed by both Ruth Etting and Bing Crosby in 1933. In South Africa the rendition by Percy Sledge is probably the best known version.	0

Sehorn\, Wilbert Harrison  Recorded at Reflection Sound Studio\, Charlotte\, N.C.  Remixed at Select Sound Studios  ------------------------  "My Babe" is a blues song and a blues standard written by Willie Dixon for Little Walter. Released in 1955 on Checker Records\, a subsidiary of Chess Records\, the song was the only Dixon composition ever to become a no. 1 R&B single\, and it was one of the biggest hits of either of their careers.   The song was based on the traditional gospel song "This Train (Is Bound For Glory)"\, which Sister Rosetta Tharpe recorded in the 1939 hit\, "This Train". Dixon reworked the arrangement and lyrics from the sacred\, the procession of saints into Heaven\, into the secular\, a story about a woman that won't stand for her man to cheat: "My baby\, she don't stand no cheating\, my babe\, she don't stand none of that midnight creeping".  Ray Charles had famously\, and controversially\, pioneered the gospel-song-to-secular-song approach with his reworking of the gospel hymn "It Must Be Jesus." into "I Got a Woman"\, which hit the Billboard R&B charts on January 22\, 1955\, later climbing to the #1 position for one week. Within days of the appearance of Charles's song on the national charts\, Little Walter entered the studio to record "My Babe"\, on January 25\, 1955. "My Babe" was released while "I've Got A Woman" was still on the charts\, and eclipsed Charles's record by spending 19 weeks on the Billboard R&B charts beginning on March 12\, 1955\, including five weeks at the number one position\, making it one of the biggest R&B hits of 1955.  The "B" side of "My Babe" was the harmonica instrumental "Thunderbird"\, following the pattern established by the release of Little Walter's number #1 hit single from 1952\, "Juke"\, of featuring a vocal performance one side and a harmonica instrumental on the flip side.  Recording  Although no documentation exists\, the song was probably recorded at Universal Recorders in Chicago\, the site of the majority of Chess and Checker sessions until Chess opened their own studio c. 1956/'57. Backing Little Walter's vocals and harmonica were Robert Lockwood\, Jr. and Leonard Caston on guitars\, Willie Dixon on double-bass\, and Fred Below on drums.  Guitarist Luther Tucker\, then a member of Walter's band\, was absent from the recording session that day. "My Babe" was re-issued in 1961 with an overdubbed female vocal backing chorus and briefly crossed over to the pop charts.   Cover Versions  The success of song lead to dozens of cover versions by many diverse artists: Elvis Presley released a live cover on the album From Memphis to Vegas/From Vegas to Memphis Dale Hawkins released "My Babe" as a single by Checker Records Chuck Berry covered the song on Chuck Berry in 1975 The song was performed by Little Walter\, Bo Diddley\, and Muddy Waters on Super Blues Sonny Burgess and the Pacers on their self-titled album Cliff Richard on Cliff Ricky Nelson on his 1958 album Ricky Nelson Peter & Gordon on In Touch With... Donald Byrd on Up with Donald Byrd Ronnie Milsap on Just for a Thrill Conway Twitty\, Ramsey Lewis\, Grant Green\, Mississippi Fred McDowell\, Coleman Hawkins\, Gene Ammons\, The Everly Brothers\, The Animals\,the Steve Miller Band\, Lou Rawls\, Ike & Tina Turner\, and many others have also covered the song. Mose Allison rewrote it as "My Brain" and recorded it for his 2010 album "The Way of the World". The song "My Babe" by the Spencer Davis Group (Stevie Winwood) on their first album is a different song. "My Babe" was performed by Ben Harper\, with James Cotton sitting in on blues harp\, during the induction ceremony for Little Walter into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame on March 10\, 2008. "My Babe" was sung by Robert Britton Lyons\, portraying Carl Perkins\, in medley with "Sixteen Tons" sung by Lance Guest\, portraying Johnny Cash\, in the Broadway musical "Million Dollar Quartet\," which opened in New York in April\, 2010. Lyons and Guest also covered the songs on the "Million Dollar Quartet" original Broadway cast recording\, copyright 2010 by MDQ Merchandising\, LLC."	0

COL title VAL That Ole Devil Called Love COL performer VAL Billie Holiday	COL video title VAL Gene Rockwell - Walk away COL channel name VAL keurspel (Leon Rossouw) COL description VAL Gene Rockwell (real name Gert Smit) was a South African artist\, and a legend in his time. He was born 27 December 1944 in Krugersdorp\, close to Johannesburg\, and died on 3 July 1998. He won his first talent competition at the age of 15 in Durban's "Little Top". Still in his teens\, Gene formed The Blue Angels (to become The Falcons in 1963) with whom he played guitar and sang his famous gritty-blues-style songs. The original line up of the Falcons were George Usher (lead guitar)\, Jannie Heynes (bass guitar)\, Clive Swegman (rhythm guitar)\, Frank Rickson (drums). Gene's most famous recording was "Heart"\, which has been one of the top selling singles in South African history.  This song was released in 1965 on the album "The Heart And Soul Of Gene Rockwell". It was written by Udo Jürgens as "Warum nur warum?"\, and his manager Don Black subsequently provided English lyrics to change it to "Walk Away". It was first recorded by Matt Monro in 1964.	0

Digitally reissued\, and on CD\, on Waiata Vol1: Maori Showbands\, Balladeers and Popstars compilation put together by Grant Gillanders (EMI NZ).The song was originally made famous by Brenton Wood.   Bio from Amplifier.co.nz\, who have two digital albums of nhis recordings available... http://www.amplifier.co.nz/artist/20358/nash-chase.html?full=1   "Born in Taihape\, Nash Chase entered the New Zealand pop scene in 1970 with a top ten single What greater Love which peaked on the national chart at number ten. Nash came from a large family of eighteen brothers and sisters and all were musically inclined so it was no surprise when he decided on a career in entertainment.  In 1971 Nash entered the Studio One TV contest and ended up as winner of the New Faces section\, which resulted in a recording contract with EMI. His first single for the label Today I Killed A Man I Didn't Know became an immediate top twenty hit and was a finalist in the 1971 Loxene Gold Disc Awards.   The follow-up releases If You'd Like To Be A Lady\, Eye For The main Chance\, and Anderson And Wise also became winners with Anderson And Wise reaching the finals of the 1972 Studio One Contest.   With his commercial appeal Nash was always a favourite with radio and his final single release Maria Isabella also became a finalist in the 1973 RATA Awards.   In February 1973 Nash Chase and his wife decided to leave New Zealand for the entertainment circuit in Australia and although EMI there released a selection of singles over the following year he was unable to break into the lucrative Sydney scene."	0

Thirty-four years later the two recorded it together for this album and gave it one of its most luminous performances. In this encounter\, Carter\, at 70\, and Gillespie\, at 60\, were inspired to some of the best playing of what might be described as their later years if it weren't for the fact that\, at this writing\, both were going strong into the 1990s. Gillespie's superb bassist of the great 1947-48 big band\, Al McKibbon\, is in the rhythm section with Tommy Flanagan\, Joe Pass\, and Mickey Roker.	1

Clover released two country-rock albums before changing their sound to something closer to pub rock\, whereupon Nick Lowe heard them\, really liked them\, and hooked them up with Jake Riviera and Elvis Costello\, which led to several members backing Elvis on My Aim Is True and two excellent albums on the Vertigo label.  However\, what Clover has become most famous for is featuring a lead singer/harmonica player by the name of Huey Lewis\, who of course went on to great fame in the '80s and beyond.

Turn the thrusters on Were standing by Theres no reply  4\, 3\, 2\, 1 Earth below us Drifting\, falling Floating weightless Calling\, calling Home  Across the stratosphere A final message: Give my wife my love Then nothing more  Far beneath the ship The world is mourning They dont realize Hes alive No one understands But Major Tom sees Now the light commands This is my home.. Im coming home  Earth below us Drifting\, falling Floating weightless Coming home  Earth below us Drifting\, falling Floating weightless Coming home  Earth below us Drifting\, falling Floating weightless Coming Coming home Home Home Home Home Home	0

COL title VAL End of the World COL performer VAL Sonny James	COL video title VAL Kenny Burrell - Jimmy Smith - Easy Living COL channel name VAL rapitroy COL description VAL Personnel: Kenny Burrell (guitar); Jimmy Smith (organ); George Duvivier\, Milt Hinton (bass); Bill English\, Mel Lewis (drums).  Producer: Creed Taylor.  Reissue producer: Ben Young.  Recorded at the Van Gelder Studio\, Englewood Cliffs\, New Jersey on July 16\, 1963; Bell Sound Studios\, New York\, New York on July 25\, 1963; A&R Recording\, New York\, New York on July 29\, 1963. Includes liner notes by Michael Ullman and Del Shields.  Digitally remastered using 24-bit technology by Kevin Reeves (Polygram Studios).  This is part of the Verve Master Edition series.  This auspicious recording started out almost as an afterthought. Jimmy Smith was in the midst of making his excellent big-band album ANY NUMBER CAN WIN when he stepped into a couple of New York studios with old pal Kenny Burrell and a rhythm section to quickly cut the sides that became BLUE BASH. The air of spontaneity is certainly present here\, as Burrell and Smith use the common language of the blues to move through a varied program.  An appropriately simmering version of the Peggy Lee hit "Fever" finds Smith at his most sensual. The upbeat\, Burrell-penned "Travelin'" has something of a gospel jubilee feel\, along the lines of "When the Saints Go Marching In\," and Burrell's joyous lines makes the most of the celebratory mood. The standard "Easy Living" finds the fiery Smith in an uncommonly wistful mode\, contributing blissful\, pretty organ runs over Burrell's lush harmonies. The revealing bonus tracks\, almost another album's worth of material\, shed further light on the interaction between the musicians\, revealing both endearing flubs and previously unheard gems.	0

COL title VAL Where or When COL performer VAL Julie Andrews	COL video title VAL Bessie Smith -- Baby Won't You Please Come Home 1923 COL channel name VAL Henri Erwig COL description VAL Bessie Smith -- Baby Won't You Please Come Home 1923  Bessie Smith (1892 or 1894 --1937) was the most popular and successful female American blues singer of the 1920s and 1930s\, and a strong influence on subsequent generations\, including Billie Holiday\, Mahalia Jackson\, Dinah Washington\, Nina Simone and Janis Joplin. This is one of her first recordings in 1923 with pianist Clarence Williams. In no other way than living the kind of violent\, hard-drinking street life she sang about\, could Bessie Smith have inspired in her audiences the powerful empathy that ultimately won her the title\, "Empress of the Blues." Throughout her career\, Bessie was respected for being a strong\, independent African-American woman with tremendous talent and determination. She expressed great pride in her culture\, and gladly participated in its earthy pleasures\, regularly indulging her taste for alcohol and sex to extremes. How ever much others tried to run roughshod over her\, Bessie refused to submit to the slightest abuse without a knock-down\, drag-out fight. With few exceptions\, she held to her musical ideals with equal tenacity. Though musically illiterate\, she regularly collaborated with her pianists to compose and write down her music and her words frequently touched on pertinent events in her life. Her performance style\, too\, derives considerably from her own personal and cultural attributes. (first posted on ilbofilms feb 24 2008; 492 views)	0

COL title VAL House of the Rising Sun COL performer VAL Buster Poindexter	COL video title VAL To All The Men I've Loved Before - Shirley Bassey (1984 Recording) COL channel name VAL Shirley Bassey Music and Vids COL description VAL 1984/1986 (Here is another mid-1980's single by Shirley Bassey titled\, 'To All The Men I've Loved Before'.  This song was originally written as 'To All The Girls I've Loved Before\, and it was a hit for Julio Iglesias and Willie Nelson.    This song was recorded before digital CD format came into existence\, and because Towerbell Records went out of business\, this song along with all Shirley's 1980's Towerbell recordings are only available via second hand outlets in vinyl format.  It took many attempts to move this track from my record player to a MP3 file trying to obtain the best sound possible\, and I think it plays well.  I kept trying to clean the record to remove the embedded dust\, then it would only play the left side....then it would only play the right side.  Finally....success!   I can't believe that was how we used to listen to music!  ABOUT this song: "To All the Girls I've Loved Before" is a song originally sung by Albert Hammond\, but more famous for a 1984 cover by singers Julio Iglesias and Willie Nelson\, which appeared on Iglesias's album 1100 Bel Air Place. A breakthrough for Iglesias in the English language market\, the song peaked at #5 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #1 on the RPM Top Singles. "To All the Girls I've Loved Before" went to number one on the country chart\, and was one of two entries on the country chart for Julio Iglesias and Willie Nelson as duo (the second was "Spanish Eyes"\, which peaked at #8 in late 1988).  It was Iglesias' biggest hit in the United States and Canada\, and Nelson's biggest European hit. The record also appeared on Australian\, New Zealand and South African charts. The song has become Iglesias's signature English-language tune\, prominently performed at his concerts since the single's release. Thanks to this song\, 1100 Bel Air Place became Iglesias' world-wide best selling album. In 1984\, Nelson and Iglesias were also named "Duo of the year" by the Country Music Association\, and "To All the Girls I've Loved Before" was named single of the year by the Academy of Country Music.  LYRICS: To all the men I've loved before Who travelled in and out my door I'm glad they came along I dedicate this song To all the men I've loved before  To all the men I once caressed And may I say I've held the best For helping me to grow I owe a lot I know To all the men I've loved before  The winds of change are always blowing And every time I try to stay The winds of change continue blowing And they just carry me away  To all the men who shared my life Who wanted me to be their wife I'm glad they came along I dedicate this song To all the men I've loved before  To all the men who cared for me Who filled my nights with ecstasy They live within my heart I'll always be a part Of all the men I've loved before  Special Thanks to Pieter\,  Astrid and others from the Shirley Bassey blog\, Tal from the Diamond Bassey website\, and all those who have contributed wonderful pictures of Shirley!	0

Join our Youtube: https://goo.gl/8AOGaN Join our Facebook: http://goo.gl/5oL723 Charles Edward Anderson "Chuck" Berry (born October 18\, 1926) is an American guitarist\, singer and songwriter and is one of the pioneers of rock and roll music. With songs such as "Maybellene" (1955)\, "Roll Over Beethoven" (1956)\, "Rock and Roll Music" (1957) and "Johnny B. Goode" (1958)\, Berry refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive\, with lyrics focusing on teen life and consumerism and music featuring guitar solos and showmanship that were a major influence on subsequent rock music. Born into a middle-class African-American family in St. Louis\, Missouri\, Berry had an interest in music from an early age and gave his first public performance at Sumner High School. While still a high-school student he was convicted of armed robbery and was sent to a reformatory\, where he was held from 1944 to 1947. After his release\, Berry settled into married life and worked at an automobile assembly plant. By early 1953\, influenced by the guitar riffs and showmanship techniques of the blues musician T-Bone Walker\, Berry began performing with the Johnnie Johnson Trio. His break came when he traveled to Chicago in May 1955 and met Muddy Waters\, who suggested he contact Leonard Chess\, of Chess Records. With Chess he recorded "Maybellene"—Berry's adaptation of the country song "Ida Red"—which sold over a million copies\, reaching number one on Billboard magazine's rhythm and blues chart. By the end of the 1950s\, Berry was an established star with several hit records and film appearances and a lucrative touring career. He had also established his own St. Louis nightclub\, Berry's Club Bandstand. But in January 1962\, he was sentenced to three years in prison for offenses under the Mann Act—he had transported a 14-year-old girl across state lines.

The "Rubber Band"\,a group from Scandinavia (Denmark?Sweden?)\, they started in 1979\, when it was still considered blasphemous to copy The Beatles\, and their music. Despite this opinion\, that was held by most of the general public\, Rubber Band continued to rehearse with dedication\, until their first public performance as "Billerne". (They later changed their name to Rubber Band\, inspired by The Beatles LP "Rubber Soul"). "X'mas - The Beatmas" recorded this Christmas songs CD by using the arrangement of the Beatles' songs. The "Rubber Band" managed to arrange and play Christmas songs using the real "Beatles sound" and instrumentation. The casual listener will immediately think that's the real Beatles.	0

Clover released two country-rock albums before changing their sound to something closer to pub rock\, whereupon Nick Lowe heard them\, really liked them\, and hooked them up with Jake Riviera and Elvis Costello\, which led to several members backing Elvis on My Aim Is True and two excellent albums on the Vertigo label.  However\, what Clover has become most famous for is featuring a lead singer/harmonica player by the name of Huey Lewis\, who of course went on to great fame in the '80s and beyond.  I really love this cover of The Ricky Nelson hit; it shows off just how tight Clover was\, and how amazing their vocals were!	0

Valley (tracks: A1\,A2\,A5\,A6\,B1\,B2\,B6)  Producer -- Willie Dunnit  ------------------------  Origin and early versions  The oldest known existing recording is by Appalachian artists Clarence Ashley and Gwen Foster and was made in 1933. Ashley said he had learned it from his grandfather\, Enoch Ashley. Alger "Texas" Alexander's "The Risin' Sun\," recorded in 1928\, is sometimes mentioned as the first recording\, but is a completely different song.  The song might have been lost to obscurity had it not been collected by folklorist Alan Lomax\, who\, along with his father\, was a curator of the Archive of American Folk Song for the Library of Congress. On an expedition with his wife to eastern Kentucky Lomax set up his recording equipment in Middlesborough\, Kentucky in the house of a singer and activist called Tilman Cadle. On September 15\, 1937 he recorded a performance by Georgia Turner\, the 16 year-old daughter of a local miner. He called it "The Risin' Sun Blues." Lomax later recorded a different version sung by Bert Martin and a third sung by Daw Henson\, both eastern Kentucky singers. In his 1941 songbook Our Singing Country\, Lomax credits the lyrics to Turner\, with reference to Martin's version. According to his later writing\, the melody bears similarities to the traditional English ballad "Matty Groves." Roy Acuff\, who recorded the song on November 3\, 1938\, may have learned the song from Clarence Ashley\, with whom he sometimes performed. In 1941\, Woody Guthrie recorded a version. A recording made in 1947 by Josh White\, who is also credited with having written new words and music that have subsequently been popularized in the versions made by many other later artists\, was released by Mercury Records in 1950. Lead Belly recorded two versions of the song in February 1944 and in October 1948 called "In New Orleans" and "The House of the Rising Sun" respectively\, and the latter was recorded in the sessions that later became the album Lead Belly's Last Sessions (1994\, Smithsonian Folkways). In 1957 Glenn Yarbrough recorded the song for Elektra Records. The song is also credited to Ronnie Gilbert on one of The Weavers albums with Pete Seeger that was released in the late 1940s or early 1950s. Frankie Laine recorded the song then titled "New Orleans" on his 1959 album Balladeer. Joan Baez recorded it in 1960 on her eponymous debut album\, and has included it in her live set list\, frequently including the song in her concerts throughout her career. In 1960 Miriam Makeba recorded the song on her eponymous RCA album. In late 1961\, Bob Dylan recorded the song for his eponymous debut album\, released in March 1962. There is no songwriting credit\, but the liner notes indicate that Dylan learned this version of the song from Dave Van Ronk. In an interview on the documentary No Direction Home\, Van Ronk said that he was intending to record the song\, and that Dylan copied his version. He recorded it soon thereafter on Just Dave Van Ronk. I had learned it sometime in the 1950s\, from a recording by Hally Wood\, the Texas singer and collector\, who had got it from an Alan Lomax field recording by a Kentucky woman named Georgia Turner. I put a different spin on it by altering the chords and using a bass line that descended in half steps—a common enough progression in jazz\, but unusual among folksingers. By the early 1960s\, the song had become one of my signature pieces\, and I could hardly get off the stage without doing it. —Dave Van Ronk  Nina Simone recorded her first version on Nina at the Village Gate in 1962. Later versions include the 1965 recording in Colombia by Los Speakers in Spanish called "La casa del sol naciente"\, which was also the title of their second album. They earned a silver record (for sales of over 15\,000 copies). The Chambers Brothers recorded a version on "Feelin' The Blues"\, released on VAULT records. Much later\, English rock band Muse recorded a version for the War Child charity.  Cover versions  The Animals Frijid Pink Dolly Parton Toto HOT R.S. Gregory Isaacs Skitzo	1

COL title VAL Blowin' in the Wind COL performer VAL Duke Ellington	COL video title VAL Staccatos - Sloop John B COL channel name VAL keurspel (Leon Rossouw) COL description VAL The Staccatos are a South African band formed in November 1961 by Brian Le Gassick. The original line-up consisted of Brian le Gassick – lead vocals\, guitar\, John Leach – lead guitar\, Willie van der Walt – bass and Ian Miller – drums. In 1962 Leach and van der Walt were replaced by Richard Crouse – guitar\, Jimmy Routledge – bass and Billy Andrews – vocals\, harmonica (Billy later became one half of the duo the “Dream Merchants” with Billy Forrest). In 1964 the Staccatos won the Transvaal Merseyside Contest\, which included a recording contract with EMI. They supported Peter and Gordon on their tour of South Africa in 1965.  In 1966 Steve Lonsdale took over the lead vocals\, and Richard Crouse married Wanda Arletti who joined the group for a tour of Zambia. In 1967 Eddie Boyle – bass\, and Ronnie Cline – organ\, joined the group. In 1968 Billy Forrest approached the group to record “Cry to me” for the film “Katrina”. This song became their biggest hit\, reaching number 1 on the South African Top 20 in 1969 and charting for a massive 38 weeks\, earning them a double gold disc.  In 1969 John Elliot – sax\, joined the group and in 1970 Ivor Black – drums and Peter Vee – lead vocals (Steve Lonsdale left for America).  This song is off the album “Come Back Silly Girl” released in 1965. It's a cover of a Beach Boys song\, although they only released it in 1966.   On this album the line-up was: Ian Miller (drums and group leader)\, Richard Crouse (lead guitar)\, Billy Andrews (lead vocals and harmonica)\, Jimmy Ryan (bass) and Brian le Gassick (rhythm guitar).	0

COL title VAL Somewhere\, My Love COL performer VAL Sonny Criss	COL video title VAL Xavier Cugat and His Orchestra -  Fascinating Rhythm COL channel name VAL Socratess2007 COL description VAL ORCHESTRAL MANOEUVRES IN THE CHARTS - 1974 Song that entered the charts : " Love's Theme " Performed by : The Love Unlimited Orchestra HCP = 1  The song was written by Barry White.  XAVIER CUGAT Cugat's family emigrated to Cuba when he was five. He trained as a classical violinist and played with the Orchestra of the Teatro Nacional in Havana. Cugat moved to New York somewhere between 1915 and 1918\, where he had his first brush with success during the tango craze with a band called "The Gigolos." When the craze ended\, the band folded\, and he picked up odd jobs as a violinist. Eventually\, he went to work for the Los Angeles Times as a cartoonist (Cugat's caricatures would later be syndicated by King Features). In the late 1920s\, as sound began to be used in movies\, he assembled another tango band that had some success in very early musical shorts. By the early 1930s\, he began appearing with some incarnation of his group in feature films with such memorable titles as "In Gay Madrid."  Cugat took his band to New York to open the new Waldorf Astoria Hotel and it became the hotel's resident group. His success was as much due to his showmanship (he dressed the band in flaming red jackets and kept up a lively patter in between a steady flow of novelty numbers mixed with dance tunes. Cugat never had any regrets about his artistic compromises: "I would rather play Chiquita Banana and have my swimming pool than play Bach and starve."  He worked the LA-New York circuit regularly for most of the next 30 years\, alternating hotel and radio dates with movie appearances. In 1940\, he recorded the song "Perfidia" with singer Miguelito Valdes and had a huge hit. Cugat had few Top 10 hits\, but he was never one to miss a trend\, quickly turning out records to share in the success of the conga craze\, the mambo craze\, the cha-cha craze\, the twist craze--you name it.  Cugat's later work is among his most interesting and listenable. His Mercury albums of the early 1960s feature some audacious stereo arrangements. "Cugie's Cocktails" is a must for your next lounge party\, with all its cuts oriented about the cocktail theme ("Manhattan\," "Cuba Libre\," "Creme de Menthe\," as well as several terrific originals). Switching to Decca in the mid-1960s\, he put out a series of albums that fall somewhere between discotheque and Latin soul and include some excellent numbers Cugat probably had more to do with the infusion of Latin music into the popular American scene than any other musician--Desi Arnaz and Perez Prado definitely followed in Cugat's footsteps.  FASCINATING RHYTHM "Fascinating Rhythm" is a popular song written by George Gershwin in 1924 with lyrics by Ira Gershwin. A large number of recorded versions exist.  One of the rarest recordings is one by Joe Bari (a pseudonym of Anthony Dominick Benedetto\, later better known as Tony Bennett) for Leslie Records in 1949 and issued as catalog number 919 with "Vieni Qui" as the flip side.  MHO Well\, yes indeed : guys like Xavier Cugat went along with the hypes and crazes of their times and tried not to miss "the money train" but one has to admit that\, what they did\, was top of the bill professionally speaking.  Here's a great example where "Cugie" turns the classic Gershwin song of 1924 into a "hip" twist dance version.  And he 'gets away with it" !  The arrangement is brilliant and doesn't leave anything to be desired.  We tried our best with regard to the editing of this one but one should be aware that this recording was made in 1959. Nevertheless : some spectacular listening is guaranteed here and\, why not re-discover that sixties dance craze : the twist :-) ? Whatever you decide to do : enjoy !	0

COL title VAL Work Song COL performer VAL Roy Hargrove & Antonio Hart	COL video title VAL Freddie Taylor & Django Reinhardt - After You've Gone - 1936 May 4 - Gramophone\, Paris COL channel name VAL Heinz Becker COL description VAL Django Reinhardt et le Quintette du Hot Club de France\, avec Stéphane Grappelli  Stéphane Grappelli (v);  Django Reinhardt (g solo);  Joseph Reinhardt\, Pierre "Baro" Ferret (g);  Lucien Simoens (b);  Freddy Taylor (vo)   After its initial recordings on Ultraphone and Decca\, the QHCF moved to the HMV label.  "After You've Gone" was recorded on their first session for the label and there seems to have been some growing pains. The balance is not as good as on the other labels\, with especially weak recording of the bass.  The opening chorus is by Grappelli this time around and he is immediately followed by the Louis Armstrong-inspired singing of Freddie Taylor. It seems that everyone is holding back in these opening choruses\, and sure enough\, as soon as Taylor is finished\, the intensity goes up as Django goes into a finger-busting chorus filled with fast arpeggios and runs\, and concluding with a chorded intro to Grappelli. The violinist takes charge\, building the intensity with every chorus. The breaks\, built into the tune at the end of each 16-bar section\, seem to have little effect on Taylor\, but each time Reinhardt and Grappelli hit them\, they add to the growing excitement of the recording.   1936 May 4 - Gramophone\, Paris	0

Valley (tracks: A1\,A2\,A5\,A6\,B1\,B2\,B6)  Producer -- Willie Dunnit  ------------------------  Origin and early versions  The oldest known existing recording is by Appalachian artists Clarence Ashley and Gwen Foster and was made in 1933. Ashley said he had learned it from his grandfather\, Enoch Ashley. Alger "Texas" Alexander's "The Risin' Sun\," recorded in 1928\, is sometimes mentioned as the first recording\, but is a completely different song.  The song might have been lost to obscurity had it not been collected by folklorist Alan Lomax\, who\, along with his father\, was a curator of the Archive of American Folk Song for the Library of Congress. On an expedition with his wife to eastern Kentucky Lomax set up his recording equipment in Middlesborough\, Kentucky in the house of a singer and activist called Tilman Cadle. On September 15\, 1937 he recorded a performance by Georgia Turner\, the 16 year-old daughter of a local miner. He called it "The Risin' Sun Blues." Lomax later recorded a different version sung by Bert Martin and a third sung by Daw Henson\, both eastern Kentucky singers. In his 1941 songbook Our Singing Country\, Lomax credits the lyrics to Turner\, with reference to Martin's version. According to his later writing\, the melody bears similarities to the traditional English ballad "Matty Groves." Roy Acuff\, who recorded the song on November 3\, 1938\, may have learned the song from Clarence Ashley\, with whom he sometimes performed. In 1941\, Woody Guthrie recorded a version. A recording made in 1947 by Josh White\, who is also credited with having written new words and music that have subsequently been popularized in the versions made by many other later artists\, was released by Mercury Records in 1950. Lead Belly recorded two versions of the song in February 1944 and in October 1948 called "In New Orleans" and "The House of the Rising Sun" respectively\, and the latter was recorded in the sessions that later became the album Lead Belly's Last Sessions (1994\, Smithsonian Folkways). In 1957 Glenn Yarbrough recorded the song for Elektra Records. The song is also credited to Ronnie Gilbert on one of The Weavers albums with Pete Seeger that was released in the late 1940s or early 1950s. Frankie Laine recorded the song then titled "New Orleans" on his 1959 album Balladeer. Joan Baez recorded it in 1960 on her eponymous debut album\, and has included it in her live set list\, frequently including the song in her concerts throughout her career. In 1960 Miriam Makeba recorded the song on her eponymous RCA album. In late 1961\, Bob Dylan recorded the song for his eponymous debut album\, released in March 1962. There is no songwriting credit\, but the liner notes indicate that Dylan learned this version of the song from Dave Van Ronk. In an interview on the documentary No Direction Home\, Van Ronk said that he was intending to record the song\, and that Dylan copied his version. He recorded it soon thereafter on Just Dave Van Ronk. I had learned it sometime in the 1950s\, from a recording by Hally Wood\, the Texas singer and collector\, who had got it from an Alan Lomax field recording by a Kentucky woman named Georgia Turner. I put a different spin on it by altering the chords and using a bass line that descended in half steps—a common enough progression in jazz\, but unusual among folksingers. By the early 1960s\, the song had become one of my signature pieces\, and I could hardly get off the stage without doing it. —Dave Van Ronk  Nina Simone recorded her first version on Nina at the Village Gate in 1962. Later versions include the 1965 recording in Colombia by Los Speakers in Spanish called "La casa del sol naciente"\, which was also the title of their second album. They earned a silver record (for sales of over 15\,000 copies). The Chambers Brothers recorded a version on "Feelin' The Blues"\, released on VAULT records. Much later\, English rock band Muse recorded a version for the War Child charity.  Cover versions  The Animals Frijid Pink Dolly Parton Toto HOT R.S. Gregory Isaacs Skitzo	1

COL title VAL Everybody Loves a Lover COL performer VAL The New Andre Kostelanetz	COL video title VAL This Bitter Earth - Jimmy Ponder COL channel name VAL michael1608 COL description VAL Jimmy Ponder is well known among serious lovers of jazz guitar. He has played with many of the finest jazz musicians of the era including Dizzy Gillespie\, Stanley Turrentine\, Groove Holmes\, Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Big Band\, Hank Crawford\, Jimmy MacGriffe\, Jack McDuff\, and Sonny Stitt. He began playing at age 11 and is a self-taught musician. Despite never having attended college\, he now teaches at several colleges and is an artist-in-residence at Duquesne University. Vastly underrated Ponder is reported to have said "If I die in poverty\, I've had the best life can offer which is love\, admiration and respect of my public and my friends. You can't ask for that. You can't buy it".  "This Bitter Earth" is a 1960 song made famous by rhythm and blues singer Dinah Washington. Written and produced by Clyde Otis\, it topped the U.S. R&B charts for the week of 25 July 1960 and also reached #24 on the U.S. pop charts. Ponder released the track on the 1999 album To Reach A Dream on the Muse record label. Recorded at Fox Recording Studios\, Rutherford\, NJ (1991); Van Gelder Studios\, Englewood Cliffs\, NJ (1991). Musicians were Jimmy Ponder (guitar); Dr. Lonnie (organ); Greg Bandy (drums); Lawrence Killian (percussion).

COL title VAL You're a Mean One\, Mr. Grinch COL performer VAL Thurl Ravenscroft	COL video title VAL "I'll Be A Friend With Pleasure" by Bix Beiderbecke COL channel name VAL Michael Laprarie COL description VAL I'll Be A Friend 'With Pleasure' is cornetist Bix Beiderbecke's next-to-last appearance in a recording studio.  His last recording session took place only one week later.  This Sept. 8\, 1930 date was organized around a group of Bix's close\, long-time friends.  The label credits trumpeter Ray Lodwig as the group's director; he takes the muted trumpet chorus that opens up the record.  Other band members included Boyce Cullen on trombone\, Benny Goodman\, Jimmy Dorsey\, and Pee Wee Russel on clarinet and alto sax\, Min Leibrook on string bass\, Irving Brodsky on piano\, and Gene Krupa on drums.  The band plods along all the way through Wes Vaughn's warbly falsetto vocal\, but then Bix and Jimmy Dorsey both play beautiful choruses\, bringing the record to a satisfying close.  It is possible that the phrase 'With Pleasure' is a reference to the Camel Pleasure Hour radio broadcast\, which at the time included Bix in its studio orchestra.  The record player is an Orthophonic Victrola model VE4-4X\, or "Granada". The "E" in the model number indicates that the Victrola is fitted with a synchronous A/C motor instead of a wind-up motor. The machine has a full "orthophonic" playback system (for electrically-recorded records) including the special orthophonic sound box with a duralumin diaphragm and a folded exponential horn inside of the cabinet. Although the gigantic Credenza Victrola produced deeper bass\, the Granada had the most accurate overall frequency response of all the acoustic Orthophonic Victrolas. The serial number indicates that this machine was probably manufactured in 1926.  I shoot my video with a Sony Digital 8 format camera. For audio\, I use a Shure SM-57 microphone on a stand placed about 4 feet in front of the Victrola horn. Although I normally use "soft tone" needles\, this video was made with a "bright" or "loud" tone needle. The mic is plugged directly into the video camera. The videos are edited with Windows Movie Maker. I use Sound Forge 9 to clean up the audio\, but don't worry -- you're hearing the record exactly as the Victrola plays it!

COL title VAL Spartacus Love Theme COL performer VAL Gerry Gibbs Thrasher Dream Trio	COL video title VAL Billy Vaughn -- Love Is a Many Splendored Thing COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Richard "Billy Vaughn" (el 12 de abril de 1919 - el 26 de septiembre de 1991) era un cantante\, multiinstrumentista\, y líder de orquesta. Él nació en Glasgow\, Kentucky\, donde su padre era un barbero que amó la música e inspiró a Billy y le enseñó  tocar la mandolina a la edad de 3 años cuando padecía  un caso de la sarampión. Él continuó aprendiendo varios otros instrumentos.  En 1941 Vaughn se afilió a la Guardia Nacional de los Estados Unidos para lo que había sido preparado como una cesión de un año\, pero cuando la Segunda Guerra Mundial estalló\, le enviaron al extranjero hasta el final la guerra  en 1945.  Él decidió hacer de la música su carrera cuando él fue licenciado del ejército al final de guerra\, y asistió al Colegio de Estado de Kentucky Occidental\, ahora conocido como la Universidad de Kentucky Occidental.  Mientras él estaba un estudiante allí\, otros tres compañeros\, Jimmy Sacca\, Donald McGuire\, y Seymour Spiegelman\, que habían formado un trío vocal\, el Hilltoppers\, reclutaron a Vaughn para tocar el piano con ellos. Él pronto añadió su voz \, convirtiendo el trío en un cuarteto. Como  miembro del grupo\, él también escribió su primera canción \, Tentativa\, que charted en 1952.  En 1954 dejó el grupo para afiliarse a Archivos de Punto en Gallatin\, Tennessee como el director de música.

It was released in 1966 by The Cyrkle and I think it went to #2 on the charts. It was the second track on The Feel Of Neil. I would like to thank sunshinetunes67 for helping me find this mp3. If you have never been to sunshinetunes67's channel I highly recommend it. You will hear some old songs you cant hear anywhere else. He has an amazing collection of some familiar and some never heard. It was fun for me making this video; I was trying a little animation which requires a lot of images to do. I look at it and think it might be a little hokey but when I see that ball come through the hoop it makes me smile. I sometime like to morph my images one into the next and sometimes I am lazy and use a program that makes the movie for me I just put the images in and choose the style.	0

Valley (tracks: A1\,A2\,A5\,A6\,B1\,B2\,B6)  Producer -- Willie Dunnit  ------------------------  Origin and early versions  The oldest known existing recording is by Appalachian artists Clarence Ashley and Gwen Foster and was made in 1933. Ashley said he had learned it from his grandfather\, Enoch Ashley. Alger "Texas" Alexander's "The Risin' Sun\," recorded in 1928\, is sometimes mentioned as the first recording\, but is a completely different song.  The song might have been lost to obscurity had it not been collected by folklorist Alan Lomax\, who\, along with his father\, was a curator of the Archive of American Folk Song for the Library of Congress. On an expedition with his wife to eastern Kentucky Lomax set up his recording equipment in Middlesborough\, Kentucky in the house of a singer and activist called Tilman Cadle. On September 15\, 1937 he recorded a performance by Georgia Turner\, the 16 year-old daughter of a local miner. He called it "The Risin' Sun Blues." Lomax later recorded a different version sung by Bert Martin and a third sung by Daw Henson\, both eastern Kentucky singers. In his 1941 songbook Our Singing Country\, Lomax credits the lyrics to Turner\, with reference to Martin's version. According to his later writing\, the melody bears similarities to the traditional English ballad "Matty Groves." Roy Acuff\, who recorded the song on November 3\, 1938\, may have learned the song from Clarence Ashley\, with whom he sometimes performed. In 1941\, Woody Guthrie recorded a version. A recording made in 1947 by Josh White\, who is also credited with having written new words and music that have subsequently been popularized in the versions made by many other later artists\, was released by Mercury Records in 1950. Lead Belly recorded two versions of the song in February 1944 and in October 1948 called "In New Orleans" and "The House of the Rising Sun" respectively\, and the latter was recorded in the sessions that later became the album Lead Belly's Last Sessions (1994\, Smithsonian Folkways). In 1957 Glenn Yarbrough recorded the song for Elektra Records. The song is also credited to Ronnie Gilbert on one of The Weavers albums with Pete Seeger that was released in the late 1940s or early 1950s. Frankie Laine recorded the song then titled "New Orleans" on his 1959 album Balladeer. Joan Baez recorded it in 1960 on her eponymous debut album\, and has included it in her live set list\, frequently including the song in her concerts throughout her career. In 1960 Miriam Makeba recorded the song on her eponymous RCA album. In late 1961\, Bob Dylan recorded the song for his eponymous debut album\, released in March 1962. There is no songwriting credit\, but the liner notes indicate that Dylan learned this version of the song from Dave Van Ronk. In an interview on the documentary No Direction Home\, Van Ronk said that he was intending to record the song\, and that Dylan copied his version. He recorded it soon thereafter on Just Dave Van Ronk. I had learned it sometime in the 1950s\, from a recording by Hally Wood\, the Texas singer and collector\, who had got it from an Alan Lomax field recording by a Kentucky woman named Georgia Turner. I put a different spin on it by altering the chords and using a bass line that descended in half steps—a common enough progression in jazz\, but unusual among folksingers. By the early 1960s\, the song had become one of my signature pieces\, and I could hardly get off the stage without doing it. —Dave Van Ronk  Nina Simone recorded her first version on Nina at the Village Gate in 1962. Later versions include the 1965 recording in Colombia by Los Speakers in Spanish called "La casa del sol naciente"\, which was also the title of their second album. They earned a silver record (for sales of over 15\,000 copies). The Chambers Brothers recorded a version on "Feelin' The Blues"\, released on VAULT records. Much later\, English rock band Muse recorded a version for the War Child charity.  Cover versions  The Animals Frijid Pink Dolly Parton Toto HOT R.S. Gregory Isaacs Skitzo	1

It is related to a group of early 20th century blues and work songs that include "I'm Alabama Bound"\, "Another Man Done Gone"\, and "Don't Leave Me Here"\, and "Turn Your Lamp Down Low". It has become a blues and rock standard\, and has been recorded by many artists.  The original 1935 single by Joe Williams' Washboard Blues Singers can be heard on Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music\, Vol. 4 (Revenant\, 2000).  Notable cover versions  Van Morrison and Them  The band Them\, fronted by Van Morrison\, released "Baby\, Please Don't Go" as the A side of a single in late 1964. Boosted by the B side\, a ditty entitled "Gloria"\, the single became their first hit\, reaching No. 10 on the UK Singles Chart. Rhythm guitar was contributed by a then little-known Jimmy Page\, however he did not play the lead guitar on the track. It was re-released on the Deram label in 1973.  John Lee Hooker's posthumously released DVD Come See About Me includes a 1992 performance where Hooker plays "Baby\, Please Don't Go" on his guitar while sitting on a dock. He is accompanied on harmonica by Them's Van Morrison.  Amboy Dukes / Ted Nugent  Since it was The Amboy Dukes' debut single\, former Dukes guitarist Ted Nugent has covered the song in live performances throughout his career. The single is included on the 1967 album The Amboy Dukes.  AC/DC recorded a version for their 1975 Australia-only album High Voltage; it was released internationally in 1984 on their compilation EP '74 Jailbreak.  Aerosmith released a version of "Baby\, Please Don't Go" on their blues cover album\, Honkin' on Bobo in 2004.

COL title VAL Mary's Boychild COL performer VAL Smokie	COL video title VAL The Flames - Try a little tenderness COL channel name VAL keurspel (Leon Rossouw) COL description VAL The Flames was a musical group from Durban in South Africa. The band was originally formed in 1963 by guitarist Steve Fataar\, bassist Brother Fataar (real name Edries Fataar)\, drummer George Faber and guitarist Eugene Champion. However\, this line-up would only be together to record a couple of songs. Ricky Fataar replaced George Faber as the band's drummer around 1964 and Edries Fredericks replaced Eugene Champion as the guitarist. Baby Duval briefly replaced Edries Fredericks in 1967. Blondie Chaplin then replaced Baby Duval in 1967. This was to be the line-up from 1967 until their demise as a group in 1970. In 1972 Ricky Fataar and Blondie Chaplin joined The Beach Boys.  This song is off the album "Soulfire!!" released in 1968. It was written by Jimmy Campbell\, Reg Connelly and Harry M. Woods\, and recorded initially on December 8\, 1932 by the Ray Noble Orchestra (with vocals by Val Rosing)\, followed by both Ruth Etting and Bing Crosby in 1933. In South Africa the rendition by Percy Sledge is probably the best known version.	0

Sung by Debbie Gravitte. That's correct\, SUNG by Debbie!  You can download this song from her album "The MGM Album"\, which includes songs from all the great MGM films of the past.  Music plays a crucial part in 2001\, and not only because of the relatively sparse dialogue. From very early on in production\, Kubrick decided that he wanted the film to be a primarily non-verbal experience\,one that did not rely on the traditional techniques of narrative cinema\, and in which music would play a vital role in evoking particular moods. About half the music in the film appears either before the first line of dialogue or after the final line. Almost no music is heard during any scenes with dialogue.  The film is remarkable for its innovative use of classical music taken from existing commercial recordings. Most feature films then and now are typically accompanied by elaborate film scores or songs written especially for them by professional composers. In the early stages of production\, Kubrick had actually commissioned a score for 2001 from noted Hollywood composer Alex North\, who had written the score for Spartacus and also worked on Dr. Strangelove.  However\, during post-production\, Kubrick chose to abandon North's music in favor of the now-familiar classical music pieces he had earlier chose as "guide pieces" for the soundtrack. North did not know of the abandonment of the score until after he saw the film's premiere screening.  The initial MGM soundtrack album release contained none of the material from the altered and uncredited rendition of "Aventures"\, used a different recording of "Also Sprach Zarathustra" than that heard in the film\, and a longer excerpt of "Lux Aeterna" than that in the film.

Join our Youtube: https://goo.gl/8AOGaN Join our Facebook: http://goo.gl/5oL723 Charles Edward Anderson "Chuck" Berry (born October 18\, 1926) is an American guitarist\, singer and songwriter and is one of the pioneers of rock and roll music. With songs such as "Maybellene" (1955)\, "Roll Over Beethoven" (1956)\, "Rock and Roll Music" (1957) and "Johnny B. Goode" (1958)\, Berry refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive\, with lyrics focusing on teen life and consumerism and music featuring guitar solos and showmanship that were a major influence on subsequent rock music. Born into a middle-class African-American family in St. Louis\, Missouri\, Berry had an interest in music from an early age and gave his first public performance at Sumner High School. While still a high-school student he was convicted of armed robbery and was sent to a reformatory\, where he was held from 1944 to 1947. After his release\, Berry settled into married life and worked at an automobile assembly plant. By early 1953\, influenced by the guitar riffs and showmanship techniques of the blues musician T-Bone Walker\, Berry began performing with the Johnnie Johnson Trio. His break came when he traveled to Chicago in May 1955 and met Muddy Waters\, who suggested he contact Leonard Chess\, of Chess Records. With Chess he recorded "Maybellene"—Berry's adaptation of the country song "Ida Red"—which sold over a million copies\, reaching number one on Billboard magazine's rhythm and blues chart. By the end of the 1950s\, Berry was an established star with several hit records and film appearances and a lucrative touring career. He had also established his own St. Louis nightclub\, Berry's Club Bandstand. But in January 1962\, he was sentenced to three years in prison for offenses under the Mann Act—he had transported a 14-year-old girl across state lines.

COL title VAL Rosetta COL performer VAL Ray Charles	COL video title VAL WHEN I TAKE MY SUGAR TO TEA (1947) by the Nat King Cole Trio COL channel name VAL wilson mcphert COL description VAL Early in his career\, Nat King Cole started a ground breaking trio in 1937\, playing piano with Oscar Moore on guitar and Wesley Prince on bass. This version of the King Cole Trio (as it was known) played a mixture of novelty songs\, jazz and pop tunes\, often with unison singing from all three members\, as well as Nat's lead vocal.   When Prince was drafted\, Johnny Miller took over on bass in 1942\, and by this time\, Nat's voice was more to the fore\, and there were less novelty songs. The melody to this song was written by Sammy Fain\, and the lyrics by Irving Kahal and Pierre Norman in 1931. It was released by the trio in 1947\, and later that same year Oscar Moore left to be replaced by Irving Ashby. The trio kept going until Nat's career really took off with singing ballads backed mainly by orchestras. At this point\, Nat was not playing much piano\, which was a pity\, as he was a really hot and infuential jazz pianist.   I have put a slide show video together using as many images of this version of the trio that I could find. Comments are welcome.	0

COL title VAL Jingle Bells COL performer VAL Die Roten Rosen	COL video title VAL Clover-Travellin' Man COL channel name VAL MrBashpop COL description VAL Band from the Bay Area who were signed to Fantasy Records\, the label which of course featured CCR.  Clover released two country-rock albums before changing their sound to something closer to pub rock\, whereupon Nick Lowe heard them\, really liked them\, and hooked them up with Jake Riviera and Elvis Costello\, which led to several members backing Elvis on My Aim Is True and two excellent albums on the Vertigo label.  However\, what Clover has become most famous for is featuring a lead singer/harmonica player by the name of Huey Lewis\, who of course went on to great fame in the '80s and beyond.  I really love this cover of The Ricky Nelson hit; it shows off just how tight Clover was\, and how amazing their vocals were!	0

Jon Mark and Johnny Almond were top London session musicians in the 60s\, at a time when the British rock explosion was at full force. They played with everyone from The Rolling Stones to Marianne Faithfull. Mark even owned a production company with guitarist Jimmy Page\, who later started the seminal rock group\, Led Zeppelin. Mark and Almond met in the late 60s\, on a two year tour with John Mayall\, the acknowledged father of the white blues. Both recorded on Mayall's classic album\, The Turning Point. On tour\, they discovered a strong musical affinity which ultimately resulted in Mark-Almond. Through the 70s the band toured the United States and Europe\, and made recordings for a variety of labels. Over time\, Mark-Almond consistently forged new ground and retained an uncanny sense of identity due to the strong musical vision of its leaders.	1
COL title VAL Unchained Melody COL performer VAL The Platters	COL video title VAL Les Elgart And His Orchestra -- For Me and My Gal COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Les Elgart (3 de agosto\, 1917\, New Haven\, Connecticut - 29 de julio\, 1995\, Dallas\, Texas) fue un director de orquesta de jazz swing y trompetista.  Lester E. (Les) Elgart comenzó a tocar la trompeta cuando era un adolescente\, y con 20 años de edad había ya realizado conciertos profesionales. En la década de 1940 tocó en las bandas dirigidas por Raymond Scott\, Charlie Spivak\, y Harry James\, y de vez en cuando en  bandas junto con el hermano Larry. Juntos crean la suya propia "Les & Larry Elgart Ensemble" en 1945\, y contratan a Nelson Riddle\, Ralph Flanagan\, y Bill Finegan para  hacer arreglos.  La unión fue efímera\, sin embargo\, debido a la huelga de Músicos de la Unión  y la disminución de la popularidad del jazz de Swing\, se separaron en 1946. En 1952\, el dúo se reunió y publicó un número importante de álbumes en Columbia Records\, muchos de considerable éxito de ventas.  Entre sus canciones más conocidas es "Bandstand Boogie"\, que fue utilizado por Dick Clark como la canción de "American Bandstand. Más tarde\, en la década de 1950 Les alejado de los negocios y la manipulación del grupo puso fin a la banda.  Les siguió trabajando hasta su muerte por insuficiencia cardíaca en Dallas\, Texas en 1995.

COL title VAL All My Loving COL performer VAL Jheena Lodwick	COL video title VAL The Dixie Cups - Iko Iko COL channel name VAL John1948FourA COL description VAL A '60s girl group\, the Dixie Cups consisted of one cousin (Joan Marie Johnson) and two sisters (Barbara Ann Hawkins and Rosa Lee Hawkins). All three young ladies were from New Orleans\, as was producer and singer Joe Jones\, who discovered the talented threesome and took them to New York.   The trio was almost known as the Meltones -- or worse\, Little Miss and the Muffets -- but the name Dixie Cups was settled on by 1964. That was the year the girls recorded the well-remembered song "Chapel of Love" on the Red Bird Records label. The number was written by Phil Spector\, Ellie Greenwich\, and Jeff Barry\, and intended to be released by the Ronettes\, Darlene Love\, or the Crystals. That one single was enough to carry the group into music history. It became the Dixie Cups' biggest success\, a million-seller\, and a worldwide hit. A few other hits followed through 1964 and into 1965\, like "You Should Have Seen the Way He Looked at Me\," "Little Bell\," "Iko Iko\," and "People Say." A year later\, Red Bird Records was out of the picture. The trio moved to ABC-Paramount\, but there were no more hits\, and 1966 saw the end of the Dixie Cups. There had been other singles\, like "Gee the Moon Is Shining Bright" and "Girls Can Tell\," but there weren't enough fans to back the releases.   In 1974\, Rosa Lee and her sister Barbara Ann left New York behind to return to New Orleans and found work as models for awhile. When the sisters began to sing and tour again\, their cousin Joan Marie declined to join in\, so her spot was filled by Dale Mickle. ~ Charlotte Dillon\, All Music Guide  PLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels\, Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

The same year this tune was released and recorded at Audio Fidelity Records label in New York City.  In 1972\, Hot Butter's rerecording was a huge hit in many countries. That version is by far the most well-known of this tune. The tune was very popular in the Soviet Union and was featured in one of the Nu\, pogodi! animated series.  Original version - Background  Composer Gershon Kingsley (of Perrey and Kingsley) first recorded it for his 1969 album Music to Moog By. In 1971 the song was re-recorded by Kingsley's band First Moog Quartet. Stan Free\, member of the First Moog Quartet\, rerecorded the instrumental with his band Hot Butter in 1972.  The title refers to the short staccato or sharp "popping" sound used.  Other cover versions  It has since been covered by various artists\, including: DJ Voyager\, Anarchic System with vocal version\, a pre-fame Jean Michel Jarre (under the pseudonyms of The Popcorn Orchestra and Jamie Jefferson)\, Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops\, Unter Null\, Richard D. James AKA Aphex Twin\, M&H Band\, Muse\, DJ Fantomas\, Gigi D'Agostino\, Guru Josh\, Iranian artist Shadmehr Aghili\, Afrosound\, The Time Frequency (TTF)\, Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass\, Norrie Paramor & the Midland Radio Orchestra\, Ronnie Aldrich\, The Treble Spankers\, the Boomtang Boys\, Space Penguins\, Pattie Brooks (disco version as part of a medley that also included Black is Black & Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye)\, Bass Bumpers (fronted by the Crazy Frog cartoon)\, Liars\, Finnish band Seidat\, Swedish DJ Richi M\, the Irish DJ Showey\, South African Psytrance act Parana\, Italian pop band La Strana Società\, Japanese electronic artists Denki Groove\, Russian Virtuoso Guitar Player Victor Zinchuk\, Spanish rock band Los Pekenikes\, Shadowy Men On A Shadowy Planet and the Swedish Chef.  It has also been remixed by Hexstatic on the Pick 'n' Mix album. In 2003 Greek synthpop Duo Marsheaux released a darker mix of "Popcorn" as their debut single\, which became a radio play hit in Europe. The song was also featured as the background music in the first version of the 1982 arcade game Pengo\, the 1983 IBM PC game Digger\, and the 1984 Mikro-Gen microcomputer game Pyjamarama.  Many cover versions were made on popular home computers such as Atari\, ZX Spectrum\, Commodore 64 and Amiga\, often by anonymous artists. On the 17th of September\, 2007\, Electropop group Plemo released a free track on micromusic.net based on the original "Popcorn" melody. It includes samples from "(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)" of the Beastie Boys. In 1976\, the tenth episode of Nu\, Pogodi! includes this song as Volk (The Wolf) tries to get closer and closer to Zayats (The Hare) at a construction site.  Big band arranger James Last recorded "Popcorn" in 1972  The song has never been covered by Kraftwerk although there are mistagged copies of the song allegedly by them (most frequently the version by M&H Band) in circulation. There is also a version circulating on the internet that is claimed to have been made by avant-garde group The Residents even though it sounds vastly different from The Residents' usual experimental sound. This version is actually made by the hard house artists called The Rezidents\, hence the confusion between the two.  A variation of "Popcorn" was used by WDIV in Detroit\, Michigan as background music for the station's Michigan Lottery Lotto drawings during the 1980s.  Most recently\, alternative rock band Muse performed this song live in Teignmouth\, UK during their two nights at The Den. The song featured prominent electric guitar along with heavy percussion and bass. A studio version of their cover was released on the 2010 single "Resistance". Faith No More covered the song live in Argentina in The Second Coming Tour.  The Muppets recorded a cover of the song featuring it as the theme of a new Swedish Chef sketch\, hence its naming as Pöpcørn\, which was released in July 2010.  Other uses  The song was used in the 1982 arcade game Pengo and the next year in the PC video game Digger.	0

Original Billboard review: "In the rush to be the first to reach the record marts\, the waxwork was tardy in getting its initial release out for the judgement of reviewers. By every commercial standard\, it's a good commercial record\, what with the highly popular "The Trolley Song"\, with Vaughn Monroe and Marilyn Duke sharing the wordage\, to tee off".   Also #2 for the Pied Pipers in October 1944\, #4 for Judy Garland in November 1944\, #13 for the Four King Sisters in November 1944 and #19 for Guy Lombardo and His Royal Canadians in January 1945.

The Excelsior record label was established by Otis René in 1944\, and ceased operations in 1951. It is particularly notable for having released some of the first recordings by Nat King Cole.

During the 1940s\, with his brother\,Leon René\, Otis René established and ran the independent rhythm and blues labels Exclusive Records and Excelsior Records. Otis was responsible for and publicly identified with Excelsior Records\, while his brother Leon was indentified with Exclusive Records.  In 1945\, René was elected president of the newly-established Pacific Coast Record Manufacturers' Association.

Thirty-four years later the two recorded it together for this album and gave it one of its most luminous performances. In this encounter\, Carter\, at 70\, and Gillespie\, at 60\, were inspired to some of the best playing of what might be described as their later years if it weren't for the fact that\, at this writing\, both were going strong into the 1990s. Gillespie's superb bassist of the great 1947-48 big band\, Al McKibbon\, is in the rhythm section with Tommy Flanagan\, Joe Pass\, and Mickey Roker.	0

COL title VAL Silent Night COL performer VAL Janice Faber	COL video title VAL Carlos Gardel - El Día Que Me Quieras (escena completa) - Audio Excelente COL channel name VAL calioff COL description VAL Alfredo Le Pera\, además de admirar la poesía del nayarita Amado Nervo\, era letrista y guionista del actor\, cantante y compositor argentino\, Carlos Gardel.   Lepera retomó la idea de la poesía de Nervo  y mediante el recurso de la paráfrasis\, realizó una nueva creación.   La letra del poema fue musicalizada por Carlos Gardel y el director de orquesta\, violinista y compositor de tangos\, el argentino Terig Tucci\, se hizo cargo de los arreglos musicales. El 19 de marzo de 1935 fue grabada en Nueva York y utilizada como tema de la película del mismo nombre\, dirigida por John Reinhardt.  El texto musicalizado quedó así:  Acaricia mi ensueño el suave murmullo de tu suspirar. ¡Como ríe la vida si tus ojos negros me quieren mirar! Y si es mío el amparo de tu risa leve que es como un cantar\, ella aquieta mi herida\, ¡todo\, todo se olvida..! El día que me quieras la rosa que engalana se vestirá de fiesta con su mejor color. Al viento las campanas dirán que ya eres mía y locas las fontanas me contarán tu amor. La noche que me quieras desde el azul del cielo\, las estrellas celosas nos mirarán pasar y un rayo misterioso hará nido en tu pelo\, luciérnaga curiosa que verá...¡que eres mi consuelo..!  En la versión cantada por Carlos Gardel\, él recita: El día que me quieras no habrá más que armonías\, será clara la aurora y alegre el manantial. Traerá quieta la brisa rumor de melodías y nos darán las fuentes su canto de cristal. El día que me quieras endulzará sus cuerdas el pájaro cantor\, florecerá la vida\, no existirá el dolor...  Para enseguida\, en la película\, continuar cantándola\, ahora a dúo con Rosita Montero:  La noche que me quieras desde el azul del cielo\, las estrellas celosas nos mirarán pasar y un rayo misterioso hará nido en tu pelo\, luciérnaga curiosa que verá... ¡que eres mi consuelo!  "El día que me quieras" poema del autor Méxicano Amado Nervo se publicó en 1922 en el libro El Arquero Divino:  El día que me quieras tendrá más luz que junio; la noche que me quieras será de plenilunio\, como notas de Bethoveen vibrando en cada rayo sus inefables cosas\, y habrá juntas más rosas que en todo el mes de mayo. Las fuentes cristalinas irán por las laderas saltando cantarinas\, el día que me quieras. El día que me quieras\, los sotos escondidos resonarán arpegios nunca jamás oídos. Éxtasis de tus ojos\, todas las primaveras que hubo y habrá en el mundo\, serán cuando me quieras. Cogidas de la mano\, cual rubias hermanitas luciendo golas cándidas\, irán las margaritas por montes y praderas delante de tus pasos\, el día que me quieras... Y si deshojas una\, te dirá su inocente postrer pétalo blanco: "¡Apasionadamente!" Al reventar el alba del día que me quieras\, tendrán todos los tréboles cuatro hojas agoreras\, y en el estanque\, nido de gérmenes ignotos\, florecerán las místicas corolas de los lotos. El día que me quieras será cada celaje ala maravillosa\, cada arrebol miraje de las Mil y Una Noches\, cada brisa un cantar\, cada árbol una lira\, cada monte un altar. El día que me quieras\, para nosotros dos cabrá en un solo beso la beatitud de "Dios".  aporte de "Carlos Tango DJ" http://carlostangodj.com & Cantando Tangos https://www.youtube.com/user/cantandotangos	0

Also called "House of the Rising Sun" or occasionally "Rising Sun Blues"\, it tells of a life gone wrong in New Orleans.  As is the case with many folk ballads\, the authorship of 'The house of the Rising Sun' remains conjectural.

Márcio Greyck apresentou um programa chamado "O Mundo é dos Jovens"\, na extinta TV Tupi de São Paulo\, ao lado da cantora Sandra\, em 1967. Nessa época\, Roberto Carlos apresentava o programa "Jovem Guarda" na TV Record\, exibido de 1965 a 1968. Revista ROLLING STONE\, Outubro de 2008\, pag 158 : "No ano em que o mundo comemora as 40 primaveras do White Album\, lançado em 1968\, o Brasil acaba de dar à luz uma versão também democrática do disco duplo dos Beatles. No original\, pela primeira vez\, Paul\, John e George abriram espaço para Ringo colocar uma música sua no repertório\, e\, como instrumentistas\, cada um teve a chance de se mostrar individualmente. No Álbum Branco produzido pelo jornalista e pesquisador Marcelo Fróes\, os 30 convidados imprimiram seu estilo às músicas. Zé Ramalho canta "Dear Prudence" na velha conhecida "atmosfera mística"\, enquanto Daniel Tendler\, com timbre grave e vocal cuidadoso\, transforma "The Continuing Story Of Bungalow Bill" em canção para ninar gente grande. Pato Fu fez "Birthday" com cara de... Pato Fu. "I Will"\, com Érika Martins\, virou um delicioso folk\, enquanto "Julia" fez as vezes de bossa nova na voz e no violão de Celso Fonseca. Grande surpresa é a versão de Márcio Greyck para "Martha My Dear": com voz dobrada\, o músico faz bela interpretação da canção de Lennon e McCartney." (..)	0

I think you only live to see the lights of town. I wasted my time when I would try\, try\, try. When the lights have lost their glow\, you're gonna cry\, cry\, cry.  Soon your sugar-daddies will all be gone. You'll wake up some cold day and find you're alone. You'll call to me but I'm gonna tell you: "Bye\, bye\, bye\," When I turn around and walk away\, you'll cry\, cry\, cry.  I lie awake at night and wait 'til you come in. You stay a little while and then you're gone again. Every question that I ask\, I get a lie\, lie\, lie. For every lie you tell\, you're gonna cry\, cry\, cry.   When your fickle little love gets old\, no one will care for you. You'll come back to me for a little love that's true. I'll tell you no and you gonna ask me why\, why\, why? When I remind you of all of this\, you'll cry\, cry\, cry.  You're gonna cry\, cry\, cry and you'll want me there\, It'll hurt when you think of the fool you've been. You're gonna cry\, cry\, cry.  You're gonna cry\, cry\, cry and you'll cry alone\, When everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own. You're gonna cry\, cry\, cry.	0

The album is a tribute to Gary Numan. The album was released April 7\, 1997.  Copyright Beggars Banquet\, 1997.  (NOTE:  I put this song up because I could not find it anywhere.  This is a pretty good cover\, and Gary Numan actually sings at times during this song.  Enjoy.)  Lyrics below - It's cold outside And the paint's peeling off of my walls There's a man outside In a long coat\, grey hat\, smoking a cigarette  Now the light fades out And I wonder what I'm doing in a room like this There's a knock on the door And just for a second I thought I remembered you  So now I'm alone Now I can think for myself About little deals And S.U's And things that I just don't understand A white lie that night Or a sly touch at times I don't think it meant anything to you  So I open the door It's the 'friend' that I'd left in the hallway 'Please sit down' A candle lit shadow on a wall near the bed  You know I hate to ask But are 'friends' electric ? Only mine's broke down And now I've no-one to love  So I find out your reason For the phone calls and smiles And it hurts And I'm lonely And I should never have tried And I missed you tonight It must be time to leave You see it meant everything to me	0

COL title VAL The Boys of Summer COL performer VAL Skin of Tears	COL video title VAL Besame Mucho by Trio Los Panchos COL channel name VAL gu7196 COL description VAL Music & lyrics written by Consuelo Velasquez of Mexico in 1941. According to Velasquez\, the song was inspired by an aria from an opera by Enrique Granados\, a Spanish composer and pianist of classical music. Played by Trio Los Panchos\, whether this was the first version I'm not sure but I found this version is the best version I've ever heard so far\, particularly their outstanding guitar arrangement.  The lyric goes :  Bésame\, bésame mucho como si fuera esta noche la última vez\, bésame\, bésame mucho que tengo miedo perderte perderte después.  Quiero tenerte muy cerca mirarme en tus ojos y estar junto a ti\, piensa que tal vez mañana estaré muy lejos muy lejos de aquí\,   bésame\, bésame mucho como si fuera esta noche la última vez\, bésame\, bésame mucho que tengo miedo perderte perderte después  Enjoy !	0

They played with everyone from The Rolling Stones to Marianne Faithfull. Mark even owned a production company with guitarist Jimmy Page\, who later started the seminal rock group\, Led Zeppelin. Mark and Almond met in the late 60s\, on a two year tour with John Mayall\, the acknowledged father of the white blues. Both recorded on Mayall's classic album\, The Turning Point. On tour\, they discovered a strong musical affinity which ultimately resulted in Mark-Almond. Through the 70s the band toured the United States and Europe\, and made recordings for a variety of labels. Over time\, Mark-Almond consistently forged new ground and retained an uncanny sense of identity due to the strong musical vision of its leaders.	0

All three young ladies were from New Orleans\, as was producer and singer Joe Jones\, who discovered the talented threesome and took them to New York.   The trio was almost known as the Meltones -- or worse\, Little Miss and the Muffets -- but the name Dixie Cups was settled on by 1964. That was the year the girls recorded the well-remembered song "Chapel of Love" on the Red Bird Records label. The number was written by Phil Spector\, Ellie Greenwich\, and Jeff Barry\, and intended to be released by the Ronettes\, Darlene Love\, or the Crystals. That one single was enough to carry the group into music history. It became the Dixie Cups' biggest success\, a million-seller\, and a worldwide hit. A few other hits followed through 1964 and into 1965\, like "You Should Have Seen the Way He Looked at Me\," "Little Bell\," "Iko Iko\," and "People Say." A year later\, Red Bird Records was out of the picture. The trio moved to ABC-Paramount\, but there were no more hits\, and 1966 saw the end of the Dixie Cups. There had been other singles\, like "Gee the Moon Is Shining Bright" and "Girls Can Tell\," but there weren't enough fans to back the releases.   In 1974\, Rosa Lee and her sister Barbara Ann left New York behind to return to New Orleans and found work as models for awhile. When the sisters began to sing and tour again\, their cousin Joan Marie declined to join in\, so her spot was filled by Dale Mickle. ~ Charlotte Dillon\, All Music Guide  PLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels\, Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

COL title VAL Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas COL performer VAL Anna Gilbert	COL video title VAL Kenny G - Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas (Arista Records 1994) COL channel name VAL ChristmasTimeTV COL description VAL "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" is a song introduced by Judy Garland in the 1944 MGM musical Meet Me in St. Louis. Frank Sinatra later recorded a version with modified lyrics\, which has become more common than the original. The song was written by Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane.  When presented with the original draft lyric\, Garland\, her co-star Tom Drake and director Vincente Minnelli criticized the song as depressing\, and asked Martin to change the lyrics. Though he initially resisted\, Martin made several changes to make the song more upbeat. For example\, the lines "It may be your last / Next year we may all be living in the past" became "Let your heart be light / Next year all our troubles will be out of sight". Garland's version of the song\, which was also released as a single by Decca Records\, became popular among United States troops serving in World War II; her performance at the Hollywood Canteen brought many soldiers to tears.  In 1957\, Frank Sinatra asked Martin to revise the line "Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow". He told Martin\, "The name of my album is A Jolly Christmas. Do you think you could jolly up that line for me?" Martin's new line was "Hang a shining star upon the highest bough". Martin made several other alterations\, changing the song's focus to a celebration of present happiness\, rather than anticipation of a better future. On The Judy Garland Show Christmas Special\, Judy sings the song to her children Joey and Lorna Luft with Sinatra's alternate lyrics.  Have yourself a merry little Christmas  Let your heart be light  From now on  our troubles will be out of sight  Have yourself a merry little Christmas  Make the Yule-tide gay  From now on  our troubles will be miles away   Here were are as in olden days  happy golden days of yore  Faithful friends who are dear to us  gather near to us once more   Through the years we all will be together  If the Fates allow  Hang a shining star upon the highest bough  And have yourself a merry little Christmas now	1

"A Lover's Question" has been recorded by many artists including Otis Redding and Del Reeves\, but was originally a hit for Clyde McPhatter in 1958 on Atlantic Records. The song was written by Brook Benton and Jimmy T. Williams and was Clyde McPhatter's most successful release\, reaching number six on the Billboard Hot 100\, and number one on the R&B chart for one week.  According to an issue of Jet magazine from February 1961\, the finger snapping you hear in Ernestine Anderson's version of the song\, was done by Brook Benton himself\, who happened to be in the studio when it was recorded.  The inimitable Ernestine Anderson is a world-class jazz singer who started her career in the late 1940s. Her debut album\, "Hot Cargo" was released by Mercury in 1956. Her best known club classic is the 1960s Bossa Nova tinged "Keep An Eye On Love".  Listen to "That's All I Want From You" here: http://youtu.be/WIv6X53v6N0	0

COL title VAL Pohjan poika COL performer VAL Emma Salokoski Ensemble	COL video title VAL Grant Green_I Remember You COL channel name VAL rapitroy COL description VAL Personnel: Grant Green (guitar); Wilbur Ware (bass); Al Harewood (drums) (1961)  Producer: Alfred Lion.  Reissue producer: Michael Cuscuna.  Recorded at the Van Gelder Studio\, Englewood Cliffs\, New Jersey on August 29\, 1961. Includes liner notes by Pete Welding.  Digitally remastered using 20-bit technology by Ron McMaster.  Grant Green has always been somewhat neglected in the pantheon of jazz guitarists. Lacking the flash of Wes Montgomery and the cerebral intensity of Jim Hall\, his strengths tended to be overlooked\, but these strengths are well exhibited on STANDARDS.  Green brings a geometric simplicity to the melody of "You Stepped Out of a Dream\," his solos unfolding with more light than heat. On Gershwin's charming "Love Walked In\," his solo tumbles gently through the changes. He pauses to reflect on a note now and then\, giving the time elasticity and looseness rather than propulsion. Bassist Wilbur Ware is similarly underrated. It's hard to understand why--his pulse and sense of the architecture of a tune are without parallel. His rock-solid time on the ballad "If I Had You" shows why he was held in such high esteem by other musicians. Green and Ware work together like a pair of safecrackers\, each deftly anticipating and complementing the moves of the other\, while drummer Al Harewood keeps steady watch. This set of terse\, swinging jazz goes a long way towards fixing Grant Green's place in the jazz guitar firmament.	0

COL title VAL Nobody's Sweetheart Now COL performer VAL The Butch Thompson Trio	COL video title VAL JOHNNY MATHIS sweet Lorraine (1958) COL channel name VAL OubaelPhoumet COL description VAL album : Swing softly  Johnny Mathis may swing softly\, but he does swing. This 1958 album features upbeat interpretations of pop standards like "You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To" and "I've Got the World on a String" performed with Percy Faith and his orchestra. Close listeners will appreciate the purity of Mathis' vocal technique\, which differs markedly from that of later singers for its infrequent use of modulation. Mathis was an album artist\, as Swing Softly -- a hit album without a hit single -- proves. Although he is known for his sensitive balladry\, Mathis swings with ease on these 12 favorites and offers something a little bit different from his previous albums.	0
COL title VAL Be My Baby COL performer VAL Linda Ronstadt	COL video title VAL Dodie Stevens - Yes\, I'm Lonesome Tonight (1960) COL channel name VAL Tom Smith COL description VAL Charted at #60 on Billboard Hot 100 in January 1961. Beautiful answer song to "Are You Lonesome Tonight" ( a song which had been a hit in the 1920's) which enjoyed a revival thanks to the 1960 Elvis Presley version. This was Dodie's last Billboard charting single. Thelma Carpenter recorded another answer record with the same title\, but with different lyrics. Thelma's single charted at #55 on the Hot 100 during the same month as Dodie's. Other answer records with the title\, "Yes\, I'm Lonesome Tonight"\, were released by Jo Ann Perry and Linda Lee.   Single released in November 1960.   Written by Turk and Handman.   B-side is "Too Young"\, which I've also posted.	0
COL title VAL Mi cherie amour COL performer VAL Rhythms del Mundo featuring Eros Ramazzotti	COL video title VAL Joe Harnell - "My Cherie Amour" COL channel name VAL Ken Newell COL description VAL Recorded from the 1960's Motown vinyl (stereo) LP\, "Joe Harnell Moving On!!"\, with music arranged\, and orchestra conducted\, by Harnell\, who also features on piano.  For the technically-minded:- The vinyl was played on a Garrard Zero-100 tangential turntable utilising a Shure M7OBX magnetic cartridge.  The analogue signal was then input via a NAD PP3 USB Preamp to my HP Pavilion laptop running Windows XP.  The sound was recorded as a WAV file using VinylStudio and then converted to an MP3 using GoldWave editing suite.  The final MP4 file was created with VideoPad video editor before uploading to You Tube.  I have uploaded other recordings from not-often-heard 1960's/1970's LP's\, including those by Joe Harnell.

Formed in Feltham\, Middlesex in 1983 the band underwent several changes through the 80s but always maintained their high standard of live performance\, becoming the number one headline act at many psychobilly festivals (an honour that still occurs throughout Europe today) and playing to packed houses on a regular basis. Their Klub Foot gigs are the stuff of legend\, selling out every time and guaranteeing rain within the venue when condensation levels became virtually stifling.

COL title VAL Be Bop A Lula COL performer VAL Stray Cats	COL video title VAL Vince Guaraldi Trio - Christmas Time Is Here (Instrumental) COL channel name VAL VinceGuaraldiVEVO COL description VAL On December 9\, 1965\, A Charlie Brown Christmas aired on TV screens across America and instantly captured the hearts and ears of a generation. Bolstering the animated special\, based on Charles M. Schulz’s immensely popular PEANUTS comic strip\, was an engaging score from Bay Area jazz artist Vince Guaraldi\, who brought characters like Charlie Brown\, Lucy\, and Snoopy to life through his evocative cues.   Working primarily with bassist Fred Marshall and drummer Jerry Granelli\, Guaraldi paired inspired interpretations of traditional holiday fare (“O Tannenbaum\,” “Hark\, the Herald Angels Sing\,” and “What Child Is This”) with original compositions\, including the instantly recognizable “Linus and Lucy” theme\, “Skating\,” and “Christmas Time Is Here.” The latter song\, available as both an instrumental and vocal track\, featured young choral singers from St. Paul’s Episcopal Church in San Rafael\, CA.    More than five decades later\, the Emmy® and Peabody®-winning animated classic has spawned more than two dozen subsequent PEANUTS specials. Guaraldi’s soundtrack\, meanwhile\, has since become one of the best-selling jazz albums in history\, second only to Miles Davis’ Kind of Blue\, and regularly ranks among America’s top-selling holiday albums every December.

Lyrics below - It's cold outside And the paint's peeling off of my walls There's a man outside In a long coat\, grey hat\, smoking a cigarette  Now the light fades out And I wonder what I'm doing in a room like this There's a knock on the door And just for a second I thought I remembered you  So now I'm alone Now I can think for myself About little deals And S.U's And things that I just don't understand A white lie that night Or a sly touch at times I don't think it meant anything to you  So I open the door It's the 'friend' that I'd left in the hallway 'Please sit down' A candle lit shadow on a wall near the bed  You know I hate to ask But are 'friends' electric ? Only mine's broke down And now I've no-one to love  So I find out your reason For the phone calls and smiles And it hurts And I'm lonely And I should never have tried And I missed you tonight It must be time to leave You see it meant everything to me	0

The big man from Mountain has lost weight but the figure he cuts is no less imposing. Leslie has a signature sound. You can hear it in everything he does from "Mississippi Queen" to three cuts on Billy Joel's "River Of Dreams". Dodgin' The Dirt - there's that distinctive tone and violin control vibrato. 'His kind of guitar' is clear focused\, coming from that center inside where talent transcends personality\, time and Long Island.  Tracklist  01. Whiskey Train (Trower/Reid) - 4:23 02.

COL title VAL Last Christmas COL performer VAL Allen Murabayashi with Manoel Felciano	COL video title VAL Nat Kendrick and The Swans - (Do The) Mashed Potatoes COL channel name VAL John1948NineD COL description VAL "(Do the) Mashed Potatoes" is a rhythm and blues instrumental. It was recorded by James Brown with his band in 1959 and released as a two-part single in 1960. For contractual reasons the recording was credited to "Nat Kendrick and the Swans."  The recording of "(Do the) Mashed Potatoes" arose out of James Brown's success in using the Mashed Potato dance as part of his stage show. Brown wanted to record a Mashed Potatoes-themed instrumental with his band in order to capitalize on the dance's popularity. However\, King Records head Syd Nathan\, a frequent critic of Brown's proposals\, would not allow it. (The first instrumental recorded by Brown and his band\, titled "Doodle Bug" and credited to Brown's tenor saxophonist J.C. Davis\, had not sold well when it was released on King's sister label Federal Records.) Brown approached Henry Stone\, a friend in the music business who ran the Dade Records label\, about recording the piece with him. Stone\, although nervous about crossing Nathan (with whom he did business)\, arranged for Brown to record at his Miami studio.  "(Do the) Mashed Potatoes" was recorded with Brown playing the piano and shouting the song's title. To prevent Brown's voice from being recognized\, Stone overdubbed shouted vocals by Carlton "King" Coleman\, a local radio DJ\, onto the recording\, though Brown's voice remains audible in the background. Leadership of the band was officially credited to Nat Kendrick\, who was Brown's drummer at the time\, while the writing was credited to "Dessie Rozier"\, a pseudonym for Brown. A simple twelve bar blues tune\, "(Do the) Mashed Potatoes" became a Top Ten R&B hit in 1960 and fed what would eventually grow into a national dance craze. The band recorded several more singles under the Nat Kendrick & the Swans name\, including "Dish Rag"\, "Slow Down"\, and "Wobble Wobble"\, but none were successful. Eventually made aware of Brown's outside success\, Syd Nathan relented and allowed him to release future instrumentals on King\, starting with the 1961 single "Hold It" b/w "The Scratch".  James Brown had a second Mashed Potatoes-themed hit with "Mashed Potatoes U.S.A." in 1962.  Personnel: "Nat Kendrick & The Swans": Carlton "King" Coleman - lead vocal Alfred Corley - alto saxophone J.C. Davis - tenor saxophone James Brown - piano\, vocal yelps Bobby Roach - guitar Bernard Odum - bass Nat Kendrick - drums  SOURCE: Wikipedia  PLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels\, Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

Ryder released another medley song in 1968; "("You've Got) Personality/Chantilly Lace"\, originally done respectively by Lee Price and The Big Bopper. The single didn't fare well on the Hot 100\, only got as high as #87\, and became Ryder's final Hot 100 entry....until 1983\, when he released a cover of Prince's "When You We're Mine". Unfortunately\, that single also reached #87! "Personality/Chantilly Lace" deserved a better chart fate\, because it still captures the raw-ness of Ryder's vocals and hard-rocking rhythm.	0

COL title VAL Let It Snow COL performer VAL A Fine Frenzy	COL video title VAL Billy Vaughn -- Love Is a Many Splendored Thing COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Richard "Billy Vaughn" (el 12 de abril de 1919 - el 26 de septiembre de 1991) era un cantante\, multiinstrumentista\, y líder de orquesta. Él nació en Glasgow\, Kentucky\, donde su padre era un barbero que amó la música e inspiró a Billy y le enseñó  tocar la mandolina a la edad de 3 años cuando padecía  un caso de la sarampión. Él continuó aprendiendo varios otros instrumentos.  En 1941 Vaughn se afilió a la Guardia Nacional de los Estados Unidos para lo que había sido preparado como una cesión de un año\, pero cuando la Segunda Guerra Mundial estalló\, le enviaron al extranjero hasta el final la guerra  en 1945.  Él decidió hacer de la música su carrera cuando él fue licenciado del ejército al final de guerra\, y asistió al Colegio de Estado de Kentucky Occidental\, ahora conocido como la Universidad de Kentucky Occidental.  Mientras él estaba un estudiante allí\, otros tres compañeros\, Jimmy Sacca\, Donald McGuire\, y Seymour Spiegelman\, que habían formado un trío vocal\, el Hilltoppers\, reclutaron a Vaughn para tocar el piano con ellos. Él pronto añadió su voz \, convirtiendo el trío en un cuarteto. Como  miembro del grupo\, él también escribió su primera canción \, Tentativa\, que charted en 1952.  En 1954 dejó el grupo para afiliarse a Archivos de Punto en Gallatin\, Tennessee como el director de música. Posteriormente formó su propia orquesta\, y tuvo un gran éxito en aquel mismo año "con la Melodía del Amor." Continuó cosechando éxitos  durante la próxima década y media. Vaughn murió del cáncer en Palomar\, California el 26 de septiembre\, { El 26 de septiembre} 1991.

Clover released two country-rock albums before changing their sound to something closer to pub rock\, whereupon Nick Lowe heard them\, really liked them\, and hooked them up with Jake Riviera and Elvis Costello\, which led to several members backing Elvis on My Aim Is True and two excellent albums on the Vertigo label.  However\, what Clover has become most famous for is featuring a lead singer/harmonica player by the name of Huey Lewis\, who of course went on to great fame in the '80s and beyond.  I really love this cover of The Ricky Nelson hit; it shows off just how tight Clover was\, and how amazing their vocals were!	0

"After You've Gone" was recorded on their first session for the label and there seems to have been some growing pains. The balance is not as good as on the other labels\, with especially weak recording of the bass.  The opening chorus is by Grappelli this time around and he is immediately followed by the Louis Armstrong-inspired singing of Freddie Taylor. It seems that everyone is holding back in these opening choruses\, and sure enough\, as soon as Taylor is finished\, the intensity goes up as Django goes into a finger-busting chorus filled with fast arpeggios and runs\, and concluding with a chorded intro to Grappelli. The violinist takes charge\, building the intensity with every chorus. The breaks\, built into the tune at the end of each 16-bar section\, seem to have little effect on Taylor\, but each time Reinhardt and Grappelli hit them\, they add to the growing excitement of the recording.   1936 May 4 - Gramophone\, Paris	0

Valley (tracks: A1\,A2\,A5\,A6\,B1\,B2\,B6)  Producer -- Willie Dunnit  ------------------------  Origin and early versions  The oldest known existing recording is by Appalachian artists Clarence Ashley and Gwen Foster and was made in 1933. Ashley said he had learned it from his grandfather\, Enoch Ashley. Alger "Texas" Alexander's "The Risin' Sun\," recorded in 1928\, is sometimes mentioned as the first recording\, but is a completely different song.  The song might have been lost to obscurity had it not been collected by folklorist Alan Lomax\, who\, along with his father\, was a curator of the Archive of American Folk Song for the Library of Congress. On an expedition with his wife to eastern Kentucky Lomax set up his recording equipment in Middlesborough\, Kentucky in the house of a singer and activist called Tilman Cadle. On September 15\, 1937 he recorded a performance by Georgia Turner\, the 16 year-old daughter of a local miner. He called it "The Risin' Sun Blues." Lomax later recorded a different version sung by Bert Martin and a third sung by Daw Henson\, both eastern Kentucky singers. In his 1941 songbook Our Singing Country\, Lomax credits the lyrics to Turner\, with reference to Martin's version. According to his later writing\, the melody bears similarities to the traditional English ballad "Matty Groves." Roy Acuff\, who recorded the song on November 3\, 1938\, may have learned the song from Clarence Ashley\, with whom he sometimes performed. In 1941\, Woody Guthrie recorded a version. A recording made in 1947 by Josh White\, who is also credited with having written new words and music that have subsequently been popularized in the versions made by many other later artists\, was released by Mercury Records in 1950. Lead Belly recorded two versions of the song in February 1944 and in October 1948 called "In New Orleans" and "The House of the Rising Sun" respectively\, and the latter was recorded in the sessions that later became the album Lead Belly's Last Sessions (1994\, Smithsonian Folkways). In 1957 Glenn Yarbrough recorded the song for Elektra Records. The song is also credited to Ronnie Gilbert on one of The Weavers albums with Pete Seeger that was released in the late 1940s or early 1950s. Frankie Laine recorded the song then titled "New Orleans" on his 1959 album Balladeer. Joan Baez recorded it in 1960 on her eponymous debut album\, and has included it in her live set list\, frequently including the song in her concerts throughout her career. In 1960 Miriam Makeba recorded the song on her eponymous RCA album. In late 1961\, Bob Dylan recorded the song for his eponymous debut album\, released in March 1962. There is no songwriting credit\, but the liner notes indicate that Dylan learned this version of the song from Dave Van Ronk. In an interview on the documentary No Direction Home\, Van Ronk said that he was intending to record the song\, and that Dylan copied his version. He recorded it soon thereafter on Just Dave Van Ronk. I had learned it sometime in the 1950s\, from a recording by Hally Wood\, the Texas singer and collector\, who had got it from an Alan Lomax field recording by a Kentucky woman named Georgia Turner. I put a different spin on it by altering the chords and using a bass line that descended in half steps—a common enough progression in jazz\, but unusual among folksingers. By the early 1960s\, the song had become one of my signature pieces\, and I could hardly get off the stage without doing it. —Dave Van Ronk  Nina Simone recorded her first version on Nina at the Village Gate in 1962. Later versions include the 1965 recording in Colombia by Los Speakers in Spanish called "La casa del sol naciente"\, which was also the title of their second album. They earned a silver record (for sales of over 15\,000 copies). The Chambers Brothers recorded a version on "Feelin' The Blues"\, released on VAULT records. Much later\, English rock band Muse recorded a version for the War Child charity.  Cover versions  The Animals Frijid Pink Dolly Parton Toto HOT R.S. Gregory Isaacs Skitzo	0

COL title VAL Silver Threads Among the Gold COL performer VAL Henry Burr and Peerless Quartet	COL video title VAL The Beau Brummels\, Play With Fire (Rolling Stones cover) COL channel name VAL ekompilation COL description VAL Beau Brummels '66 is the third studio album by American rock group The Beau Brummels\, and their first on Warner Bros. Records. The album consists of twelve cover songs and no originals. Autumn Records\, the band's previous label\, had sold the band to Warner Brothers in early 1966. Warner Brothers\, however\, did not control the publishing rights\, and opted to have the band record an album of covers\, including songs originally performed by Richard Berry\, Rolling Stones\, The Beatles and Bob Dylan\, as well as recent hit singles by such acts as The Mamas & the Papas and Simon & Garfunkel. Lead vocalist Sal Valentino explained\, "When we went to Warner Brothers\, they were just anxious to get a record out\, to capitalize on the success we had. That record was the wrong one to do at the time.  The album features Don Irving on guitar. Irving briefly became a member of the Beau Brummels filling in for Ron Elliott\, who also played on the album\, but was unable to withstand the rigors of touring due to his diabetic condition.	0

COL title VAL September Song COL performer VAL The Five Lords	COL video title VAL Theme from 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (MGM Album) - Sung by Debbie Gravitte COL channel name VAL Debbie Gravitte COL description VAL MP3 ► http://DebbieTunes.com ► http://facebook.com/DebbieGravitte   Info ►http://DebbieGravitte.com  Theme from 2001: A Space Odyssey.  Sung by Debbie Gravitte. That's correct\, SUNG by Debbie!  You can download this song from her album "The MGM Album"\, which includes songs from all the great MGM films of the past.  Music plays a crucial part in 2001\, and not only because of the relatively sparse dialogue. From very early on in production\, Kubrick decided that he wanted the film to be a primarily non-verbal experience\,one that did not rely on the traditional techniques of narrative cinema\, and in which music would play a vital role in evoking particular moods. About half the music in the film appears either before the first line of dialogue or after the final line. Almost no music is heard during any scenes with dialogue.  The film is remarkable for its innovative use of classical music taken from existing commercial recordings. Most feature films then and now are typically accompanied by elaborate film scores or songs written especially for them by professional composers. In the early stages of production\, Kubrick had actually commissioned a score for 2001 from noted Hollywood composer Alex North\, who had written the score for Spartacus and also worked on Dr. Strangelove.  However\, during post-production\, Kubrick chose to abandon North's music in favor of the now-familiar classical music pieces he had earlier chose as "guide pieces" for the soundtrack. North did not know of the abandonment of the score until after he saw the film's premiere screening.  The initial MGM soundtrack album release contained none of the material from the altered and uncredited rendition of "Aventures"\, used a different recording of "Also Sprach Zarathustra" than that heard in the film\, and a longer excerpt of "Lux Aeterna" than that in the film.

It is related to a group of early 20th century blues and work songs that include "I'm Alabama Bound"\, "Another Man Done Gone"\, and "Don't Leave Me Here"\, and "Turn Your Lamp Down Low". It has become a blues and rock standard\, and has been recorded by many artists.  The original 1935 single by Joe Williams' Washboard Blues Singers can be heard on Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music\, Vol. 4 (Revenant\, 2000).  Notable cover versions  Van Morrison and Them  The band Them\, fronted by Van Morrison\, released "Baby\, Please Don't Go" as the A side of a single in late 1964. Boosted by the B side\, a ditty entitled "Gloria"\, the single became their first hit\, reaching No. 10 on the UK Singles Chart. Rhythm guitar was contributed by a then little-known Jimmy Page\, however he did not play the lead guitar on the track. It was re-released on the Deram label in 1973.  John Lee Hooker's posthumously released DVD Come See About Me includes a 1992 performance where Hooker plays "Baby\, Please Don't Go" on his guitar while sitting on a dock. He is accompanied on harmonica by Them's Van Morrison.  Amboy Dukes / Ted Nugent  Since it was The Amboy Dukes' debut single\, former Dukes guitarist Ted Nugent has covered the song in live performances throughout his career. The single is included on the 1967 album The Amboy Dukes.  AC/DC recorded a version for their 1975 Australia-only album High Voltage; it was released internationally in 1984 on their compilation EP '74 Jailbreak.  Aerosmith released a version of "Baby\, Please Don't Go" on their blues cover album\, Honkin' on Bobo in 2004.

On the American soundtrack album release of A Hard Day's Night\, George Martin and his orchestra covered the song in a slower-tempo\, easy listening-styled instrumental version lasting over a minute longer than the Beatles' vocal version on the same album.

Records. The album consists of twelve cover songs and no originals. Autumn Records\, the band's previous label\, had sold the band to Warner Brothers in early 1966. Warner Brothers\, however\, did not control the publishing rights\, and opted to have the band record an album of covers\, including songs originally performed by Richard Berry\, Rolling Stones\, The Beatles and Bob Dylan\, as well as recent hit singles by such acts as The Mamas & the Papas and Simon & Garfunkel. Lead vocalist Sal Valentino explained\, "When we went to Warner Brothers\, they were just anxious to get a record out\, to capitalize on the success we had. That record was the wrong one to do at the time.  The album features Don Irving on guitar. Irving briefly became a member of the Beau Brummels filling in for Ron Elliott\, who also played on the album\, but was unable to withstand the rigors of touring due to his diabetic condition.	1

Join our Youtube: https://goo.gl/8AOGaN Join our Facebook: http://goo.gl/5oL723  Buy on Google Play: goo.gl/nt2FtY  Nina Simone (born Eunice Kathleen Waymon; February 21\, 1933 – April 21\, 2003) was an American singer\, songwriter\, pianist\, arranger\, and civil rights activist who worked in a broad range of musical styles including classical\, jazz\, blues\, folk\, R&B\, gospel\, and pop. Born in North Carolina\, the sixth child of a preacher\, Simone aspired to be a concert pianist. With the help of the few supporters in her hometown of Tryon\, North Carolina\, she enrolled in the Juilliard School of Music in New York. Waymon then applied for a scholarship to study at the prestigious Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia\, where she was denied despite a well-received audition. Simone became fully convinced this rejection had been entirely due to her race\, a statement that has been a matter of controversy. Years later\, two days before her death\, the Curtis Institute of Music bestowed an honorary degree on Simone. To make a living\, Eunice Waymon changed her name to "Nina Simone". The change related to her need to disguise herself from family members\, having chosen to play "the devil's music" or "cocktail piano" at a nightclub in Atlantic City. She was told in the nightclub that she would have to sing to her own accompaniment\, and this effectively launched her career as a jazz vocalist. Simone recorded more than forty albums\, mostly between 1958\, when she made her debut with Little Girl Blue\, and 1974\, and had a hit in the United States in 1958 with "I Loves You\, Porgy". Simone's musical style fused gospel and pop with classical music\, in particular Johann Sebastian Bach\, and accompanied expressive\, jazz-like singing in her contralto voice. To fund her private lessons\, Simone performed at the Midtown Bar & Grill on Pacific Avenue in Atlantic City\, whose owner insisted that she sing as well as play the piano\, which increased her weekly income to $90 a week. In 1954\, she adopted the stage name "Nina Simone". "Nina" (from niña\, meaning "little girl" in Spanish)\, and "Simone" was taken from the French actress Simone Signoret\, whom she had seen in the movie Casque d'Or. Knowing her mother would not approve of playing the "Devil's Music"\, she used her new stage name to remain undetected. Simone's mixture of jazz\, blues\, and classical music in her performances at the bar earned her a small but loyal fan base. In 1958\, she befriended and married Don Ross\, a beatnik who worked as a fairground barker\, but quickly regretted their marriage. Playing in small clubs in the same year\, she recorded George Gershwin's "I Loves You\, Porgy" (from Porgy and Bess)\, which she learned from a Billie Holiday album and performed as a favor to a friend. It became her only Billboard top 20 success in the United States\, and her debut album Little Girl Blue soon followed on Bethlehem Records. Simone lost more than $1 million in royalties (notably for the 1980s re-release of My Baby Just Cares for Me) and never benefited financially from the album's sales because she had sold her rights outright for $3\,000. After the success of Little Girl Blue\, Simone signed a contract with Colpix Records and recorded a multitude of studio and live albums. Colpix relinquished all creative control to her\, including the choice of material that would be recorded\, in exchange for her signing the contract with them. After the release of her live album Nina Simone at Town Hall\, Simone became a favorite performer in Greenwich Village. By this time\, Simone performed pop music only to make money to continue her classical music studies and was indifferent about having a recording contract. She kept this attitude toward the record industry for most of her career. Simone married a New York police detective\, Andrew Stroud\, in 1961. He later became her manager and the father of her daughter Lisa\, but he abused Simone psychologically and physically. FROM WIKIPEDIA: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina_Simone	0

COL title VAL Triste COL performer VAL Sarah Vaughan	COL video title VAL Kay Starr -- You're Driving Me Crazy (What Did I Do?) COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Kay Star\, Su verdadero nombre es Katherine Laverne Starks y nació en Dougherty (Oklahoma) el 21 de julio de 1922   Joe Venuti\, la contrató para un show de música "hillbilly" y estuvo de gira con su banda por Menphis. De allí pasó a la orquesta de Bob Crosby\, el hermano de Bing Crosby\, con trabajos de una sola noche en distintas salas de baile. Tuvo la fortuna de que el show estaba patrocinado por la "Camel Caravan" y trasmitido por radio una vez al mes a toda América para que su voz fuese conocida y alcanzara enorme popularidad. Glenn Miller\, el famoso director de orquesta\, la contrató eventualmente en sustitución de su vocalista habitual\, la rubia\, Marion Hutton\, enferma y cansada tras incesantes y continuadas giras con la orquesta.  Con la orquesta de Miller\, realizo Kay Starr\, sus primeras grabaciones oficiales: "Baby Me" y "Love With a Capitol You" recogidas en el sello Bluebird en 1939. Después de terminados sus estudios escolares vuelve con Venuti antes de incorporarse a la formación de Charlie Barnet\, con quien volvió a entrar en los estudios de grabación en 1944 para grabar para los sellos "DECCA" y "V-Disc". Al año siguiente se decide a emprender su carrera en solitario formando parte de los "Capitol International Jazzmen"\, una especie de All Stars constituidos por Bill Coleman\, Buster Bailey\, Benny Carter\, Coleman Hawkins\, Nat King Cole\, Oscar Moore\, John Kirby y Max Roach. Su vivacidad en el escenario y su canto\, alegre y desenfadado recordaba algunas veces a Ella Fitzgerald y en absoluto desentonó en compañía de tan ilustres músicos. Tras la II Guerra Mundial\, Los Ángeles era un hervidero musical y números sellos fueron tras sus pasos para que grabara en distintos espacios y formatos musicales.  En 1947\, Dave Dexter\, la incorporó a Capitol hecho que marca el principio de su carrera de éxitos. Sus temas más populares fueron "Wheel Of Fortune" y "Rock And Roll Waltz". Sin embargo\, hubo que esperar hasta su segunda vuelta a este sello en 1959\, para que Kay Starr abordase un repertorio a su altura en contextos de índole jazzsiticos. Sus álbumes "Movin" (Capitol\, 1959); "Movin' On Broadway" y "The Jazz Singer" ambos para Capitol en 1960\, y los tres con la orquesta de Van Alexander\, o el selecto disco "I Cry by Night"\, que cierra el ciclo Capitol en 1961\, y grabado en pequeña formación con Ben Webster y Lee Young\, entre otros instrumentistas\, son su testamento musical.  Estos éxitos jazzisticos tardíos\, la reconciliaban absolutamente con sus seguidores y la confirmaban como una cantante admirable aunque desgraciadamente demasiada cicatera con el jazz. Kay Starr\, siguió mas o menos activa hasta finales de los años ochenta donde ya se retiró.

Nathaniel Adams Coles (March 17\, 1919 -- February 15\, 1965)\, known professionally as Nat King Cole\, was an American musician who first came to prominence as a leading jazz pianist. Although an accomplished pianist\, he owes most of his popular musical fame to his soft baritone voice\, which he used to perform in big band and jazz genres. He was one of the first black Americans to host a television variety show\, and has maintained worldwide popularity since his death.  RIP "The Serene Poet of Jazz" George Shearing\, we lost you today (February 14\, 2011) on Valentines Day... you will be missed and we shall remember and celebrate your music forever.  Thanks for gracing us with your musical presence. Nat & George in heaven playing and singing wonderful music together once again!

Recorded in Capitol Studios\, Hollywood\, CA\, December 22\, 1961.  (Capitol Records)  Lost April\, Where did you go? Like winter's snow\, I saw you vanish. Lost April\, So soft and warm. A memory  Not even time can banish.  Lost April\, That taught me this. A single kiss Could lead to heaven. But April had numbered days\, So when they passed\,  Love couldn't last. I lost love and you\, And April\, too.  [Interlude]  So when they passed\, Love couldn't last.  I lost love and you\,  And April\, too.	1

COL title VAL House of the Rising Sun COL performer VAL Ronnie Milsap	COL video title VAL Freddie Taylor & Django Reinhardt - After You've Gone - 1936 May 4 - Gramophone\, Paris COL channel name VAL Heinz Becker COL description VAL Django Reinhardt et le Quintette du Hot Club de France\, avec Stéphane Grappelli  Stéphane Grappelli (v);  Django Reinhardt (g solo);  Joseph Reinhardt\, Pierre "Baro" Ferret (g);  Lucien Simoens (b);  Freddy Taylor (vo)   After its initial recordings on Ultraphone and Decca\, the QHCF moved to the HMV label.  "After You've Gone" was recorded on their first session for the label and there seems to have been some growing pains. The balance is not as good as on the other labels\, with especially weak recording of the bass.  The opening chorus is by Grappelli this time around and he is immediately followed by the Louis Armstrong-inspired singing of Freddie Taylor. It seems that everyone is holding back in these opening choruses\, and sure enough\, as soon as Taylor is finished\, the intensity goes up as Django goes into a finger-busting chorus filled with fast arpeggios and runs\, and concluding with a chorded intro to Grappelli. The violinist takes charge\, building the intensity with every chorus. The breaks\, built into the tune at the end of each 16-bar section\, seem to have little effect on Taylor\, but each time Reinhardt and Grappelli hit them\, they add to the growing excitement of the recording.   1936 May 4 - Gramophone\, Paris	0

Just call me angel of the morning ANGEL Just touch my cheek before you leave me\, baby. Just call me angel of the morning ANGEL Then slowly turn away from me.  Maybe the sun's light will be dim And it won't matter anyhow. If morning's echo says we ve sinned\, Well\, it was what I wanted now. And if we're the victims of the night\, I won't be blinded by light.  Just call me angel of the morning ANGEL Just touch my cheek before you leave me\, baby. Just call me angel of the morning ANGEL Then slowly turn away\, I won't beg you to stay with me Through the tears of the day\, Of the years\, baby baby baby.

Jon Mark and Johnny Almond were top London session musicians in the 60s\, at a time when the British rock explosion was at full force. They played with everyone from The Rolling Stones to Marianne Faithfull. Mark even owned a production company with guitarist Jimmy Page\, who later started the seminal rock group\, Led Zeppelin. Mark and Almond met in the late 60s\, on a two year tour with John Mayall\, the acknowledged father of the white blues. Both recorded on Mayall's classic album\, The Turning Point. On tour\, they discovered a strong musical affinity which ultimately resulted in Mark-Almond. Through the 70s the band toured the United States and Europe\, and made recordings for a variety of labels. Over time\, Mark-Almond consistently forged new ground and retained an uncanny sense of identity due to the strong musical vision of its leaders.	0

COL title VAL La mer COL performer VAL Bing Crosby	COL video title VAL Agnetha Faltskog - My Colouring Book COL channel name VAL abbafanglosuk COL description VAL After the release of I Stand Alone in 1988\, Agnetha took a break from her musical career and completely withdrew from public life.  In April 2004\, after 17 years of silence Agnetha came back with a bang by releasing the album My Colouring Book\, a collection of covers of 1960s classic oldies. The album topped the charts in Sweden\, reached top 5 in some countries and No.12 in UK.  The Times reviewer noted "her voice is still an impressive pop instrument"\, and The Observer noted "time hasn't diminished her perfect voice". The album release attracted major media attention across Europe\, but Agnetha refused to be involved in any publicity.  Despite this\, the album sold more than 500\,000 copies worldwide\, with 50\,000 of those in the UK alone. Agnetha has a fear of flying and has not been on an airplane for over 15 years.  When she goes abroad she prefers to travel by car. She prefers a tranquil life in a rural suburb south-west of Stockholm\, away from the noisy city atmosphere. Agnetha wrote these cover notes for My Colouring Book: The early impressions in life are etched with a particular strength and clarity.  That applies especially to music. So this album is a celebration of the music I heard yesterday.  A respectful homage to the artists who have inspired me and left deep prints in my soul and in my heart. This is the soundtrack of a time lost\, to which I return to\, with the mighty forces of music. I have enjoyed these songs all my life and they hold a special place in my heart. My effort was to recreate these songs with all respect for the originals.  My Colouring Book is my way of showing gratitude towards the songs\, the artists and all they have given me.  You are all deep within my heart and will stay there forever. To my family\, my friends\, to all listeners around the world and to everyone involved in this project - thank you for inspiring me to do this - I love you. Agnetha raises her voice dramatically for the third and fifth verses in this song\, to produce some of the most emotional singing I've ever heard.  She may be 53 here\, but as this picture shows\, Agnetha is still as beautiful as ever.    Words & Music by Fred Ebb & John Kander Originally recorded by Kitty Kallen in 1962.  Lyrics:   For those who fancy colouring books\, And lots of people do\, Here´s a new one for you\, A most unusual colouring book\,  The kind you never see\, Crayons ready very well\, Begin to colour me  These are the eyes that watched him\, As he walked away\, Colour them grey\,  This is the heart that thought\, He would always be true\, Colour it blue  These are the arms that held him\, And loved him then lost him somehow\, Oh... colour them empty now  These are the beads\, I wore until she came between\, Colour them green  This is the room that I sleep in\, And walk in\, and weep in\,  And hide in that nobody sees\,  Oh... colour it lonely please  This is the man\, Whose love I depended upon\, Colour him gone.	0
COL title VAL I'll Be Home for Christmas COL performer VAL Reverb [1]	COL video title VAL Besame Mucho by Trio Los Panchos COL channel name VAL gu7196 COL description VAL Music & lyrics written by Consuelo Velasquez of Mexico in 1941. According to Velasquez\, the song was inspired by an aria from an opera by Enrique Granados\, a Spanish composer and pianist of classical music. Played by Trio Los Panchos\, whether this was the first version I'm not sure but I found this version is the best version I've ever heard so far\, particularly their outstanding guitar arrangement.  The lyric goes :  Bésame\, bésame mucho como si fuera esta noche la última vez\, bésame\, bésame mucho que tengo miedo perderte perderte después.  Quiero tenerte muy cerca mirarme en tus ojos y estar junto a ti\, piensa que tal vez mañana estaré muy lejos muy lejos de aquí\,   bésame\, bésame mucho como si fuera esta noche la última vez\, bésame\, bésame mucho que tengo miedo perderte perderte después  Enjoy !	0

COPYRIGHTS RESERVED BY COPYRIGHT OWNER.This video is used only for non-profit usage and publishing. Gerard de Vries (Hilversum\, 19 augustus 1933) is een Nederlands zanger en diskjockey.Gerard de Vries is vooral bekend om zijn parlando-muziek\, waarin hij in de jaren zestig van de 20e eeuw enkele grote hits scoorde. Bekende hits van hem zijn Het spel kaarten uit 1965 en Giddy up go uit 1966. Veel van zijn nummers hebben het leven als vrachtwagenchauffeur  als onderwerp. Onder meer Giddy up go en Teddybeer zijn hier voorbeelden van. Vaak zijn deze nummers vertalingen van de populaire Amerikaanse zanger Red Sovine. Opvallend is dat de vertaalde nummers van De Vries niet rijmen\, terwijl die van Sovine dat wel doen. De hits over het leven als vrachtwagenchauffeur zijn in de regel verhalend. De nummers van De Vries hebben vaak een moraliserende ondertoon.Radio Veronica-medewerkers en diskjockeys Ad Bouman\, Hans Mondt\, Tom Collins\, Gerard de Vries en Klaas Vaak namen begin 1970 onder de naam De Binkies de carnavalshit  "Met carnaval" op. Het reikt niet verder dan de Tipparade.Naast zanger was Gerard de Vries diskjockey. Hij presenteerde aanvankelijk bij Radio Veronica onder het pseudoniem  Cowboy Gerard en later bij de TROS onder eigen naam. Gerard de Vries baarde opzien door als eerste diskjockey openlijk voor zijn homoseksualiteit uit te komen. In 1972 praatte hij over Les Cranes Engelse tekst heen op diens single "Desiderata". Het werd de B-kant van de in Nederland uitgebrachte single. Op dit moment is Gerard de Vries actief bij de lokale omroep in Wijdemeren\, Radio Wijdemeren.Na zijn carrière als zanger en diskjockey werd Gerard de Vries ondernemer in de paranormale branche.In 2007 was De Vries kort te zien in het 'datingspektakel' van (de Nederlandse versie van) het televisieprogramma Man bijt hond; hij had gereageerd op een oproep van kandidaat 'Gijs'\, die een man zocht. De Vries bood Gijs een zelfgeschreven boekje aan met de titel De Nederlandse taal.	0

This is a pretty good cover\, and Gary Numan actually sings at times during this song.  Enjoy.)  Lyrics below - It's cold outside And the paint's peeling off of my walls There's a man outside In a long coat\, grey hat\, smoking a cigarette  Now the light fades out And I wonder what I'm doing in a room like this There's a knock on the door And just for a second I thought I remembered you  So now I'm alone Now I can think for myself About little deals And S.U's And things that I just don't understand A white lie that night Or a sly touch at times I don't think it meant anything to you  So I open the door It's the 'friend' that I'd left in the hallway 'Please sit down' A candle lit shadow on a wall near the bed  You know I hate to ask But are 'friends' electric ? Only mine's broke down And now I've no-one to love  So I find out your reason For the phone calls and smiles And it hurts And I'm lonely And I should never have tried And I missed you tonight It must be time to leave You see it meant everything to me	0

COL title VAL Steel Guitar Rag COL performer VAL Hank Thompson	COL video title VAL Bob Wills - Steel Guitar Rag 1936 COL channel name VAL preservationhall01 COL description VAL Bob Wills was born in Kosse\, Texas in 1905.   In 1929 he started the Wills Fiddle Boys in Ft. Worth\, then came to the attention of perennial Texas Gubernatorial candidate Pappy Lee O'Daniel who ran the Light Crust Flour Mills in Saginaw\, Texas just north of Ft. Worth.  Wills lept to fame playing as the Light Crust Doughboys but after several years the band tired of the gig as they were also expected to load flour trucks during the day.  In '34 the band moved to Tulsa to get away from Pappy Lee and formed the Texas Playboys.  They invented western music with a jazz beat known as Western Swing.  Some of his music was dead-on jazz while other songs were straight western-his genre was hard to pin down.  On clear channel 50\,000 watt KVOO in Tulsa The Playboys broadcast from Cain's Ballroom on North Main and they played it all. In 1968 Wills was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame as the King of Western Swing- and as Willie Nelson crooned-he's still the King.  Wills died in  Ft Worth\, Texas in 1975. Leon McAuliffe\, his steel guitar player featured on this record\, was born in Houston\, Texas in 1917.  He played with Bob Wills band until WWII and after the war formed his own group in Tulsa. Steel Guitar Rag was recorded in Chicago at the Furniture Mart Building\, 666 Lakeshore Drive on September 29\, 1936 on the Vocalion and Okeh subsidiary labels of Columbia.	1

COL title VAL Scarborough Fair COL performer VAL Justin Hayward	COL video title VAL Ruth Etting - I'll Get By (As Long As I Have You) 1929 COL channel name VAL warholsoup100 COL description VAL Columbia 1733 - This Song Peaked At #3 On US Music Charts In 1929. "I'll Get By (As Long as I Have You)" is a popular song with music by Fred E. Ahlert and lyrics by Roy Turk. It was published in 1928 and originally sung by Aileen Stanley. Ruth Etting (November 23\, 1897 — September 24\, 1978) was an American singing star and actress of the 1920s and 1930s\, who had over 60 hit recordings and worked in stage\, radio\, and film.  Born in David City\, Nebraska in 1897 to Alfred and Winifred (née Kleinhan) Etting. When Ruth was five years old\, her mother died and she went to live with her paternal grandparents\, George and Hannah Etting. Alfred Etting remarried and moved away from David City and largely out of his daughter's life. Ruth Etting left David City at the age of seventeen to attend art school in Chicago. Her job designing costumes at the Marigold Gardens nightclub led to employment singing and dancing in the chorus there. She became a featured vocalist at the nightclub\, and married gangster Martin "Moe the Gimp" Snyder on July 12\, 1922. He managed her career\, booking radio appearances\, and eventually had her signed to an exclusive recording contract with Columbia Records. She made her Broadway debut in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1927. She went on to appear in a number of other hit shows in rapid succession\, including Simple Simon and Whoopee!. In Hollywood\, she made a long series of movie shorts between 1929 and 1936\, and three feature movies in 1933 and 1934. In 1936\, she appeared in London in Ray Henderson's Transatlantic Rhythm. Etting divorced Moe Snyder on November 30\, 1937\, aged 40. She fell in love with her pianist\, Myrl Alderman\, but in 1938 he was shot and injured by her ex-husband. Snyder was convicted of attempted murder\, but released on appeal after one year in jail. Etting married Alderman\, who was almost a decade her junior\, in December 1938. The scandal of the sensational trial in Los Angeles effectively ended her career\, though she briefly had a radio show in 1947. Alderman died on November 16\, 1966. Ruth Etting died in Colorado Springs\, Colorado in 1978\, aged 80. She had no children. Her life was the basis for the fictionalized 1955 film\, Love Me or Leave Me\, which starred Doris Day (as Etting) and James Cagney (as Snyder).	0

Und ich stand im Rot versunken\, noch schlaftrunkend\,  und ich dachte: Wenn das alles ist  Wenn das alles ist wenn das alles ist wenn das wirklich alles ist dann lass uns leben wie's eben so geht solang es geht wenn das alles ist  Als ich zwölf war\, nahm man mich zum Zirkus;  und ich sah Tiger durch die Reifen springen\,  Menschen\, die an Seilen hingen\,  und den Mann im Clownstrikot.  Und sie klatschten wie besessen\,  doch was dachte ich indessen?  Wenn das alles ist  Wenn das alles ist wenn das alles ist wenn das wirklich alles ist dann lass uns leben wie's eben so geht solang es geht wenn das alles ist  Und fünfzehn war ich\, da traf ich Walter\,  am Fahrkartenschalter der Stadtbahnstation.  Er hielt meine Hand\, und wir liefen durch Strassen\,  unsere düsteren Strassen\, vergassen die Kälte\,  vergassen den Hunger\, und sein Mund streifte mein Haar.   Dann kam er abhanden\, er verschwand ohne Wort.  Sterben wollte ich auf der Stelle\, sterben wollte ich\, sofort.  Doch eines Morgens\, um sechs Uhr zehn\,  sah ich mich im Fensterglas meiner Stadtbahn stehen\,  und all die Verschlafenen um mich herum\,  und ich dachte\, wenn das die Liebe war\,  wenn das die Liebe ist\, wo gar nichts war\,  wo gar nichts ist\, dann hab ich nichts vermisst.  Wenn das alles ist  Wenn das alles ist wenn das alles ist wenn das wirklich alles ist dann lass uns leben  So dachte ich damals so denk ich noch immer und wende mich ab von dem was verletzt doch kommt es mal schlimmer fällt er mir nicht ein\, er lässt mich allein\, er bleibt verschwunden\, für Wochen\, für Stunden er gilt als vermisst\, mein Satz: Wenn das alles ist  Wenn das alles ist wenn das wirklich alles ist dann lass uns leben wie's eben so geht solang es geht wenn das alles ist	0

COL title VAL Stormy Weather COL performer VAL Judy Garland	COL video title VAL WHEN I TAKE MY SUGAR TO TEA (1947) by the Nat King Cole Trio COL channel name VAL wilson mcphert COL description VAL Early in his career\, Nat King Cole started a ground breaking trio in 1937\, playing piano with Oscar Moore on guitar and Wesley Prince on bass. This version of the King Cole Trio (as it was known) played a mixture of novelty songs\, jazz and pop tunes\, often with unison singing from all three members\, as well as Nat's lead vocal.   When Prince was drafted\, Johnny Miller took over on bass in 1942\, and by this time\, Nat's voice was more to the fore\, and there were less novelty songs. The melody to this song was written by Sammy Fain\, and the lyrics by Irving Kahal and Pierre Norman in 1931. It was released by the trio in 1947\, and later that same year Oscar Moore left to be replaced by Irving Ashby. The trio kept going until Nat's career really took off with singing ballads backed mainly by orchestras. At this point\, Nat was not playing much piano\, which was a pity\, as he was a really hot and infuential jazz pianist.   I have put a slide show video together using as many images of this version of the trio that I could find. Comments are welcome.	0

COL title VAL One Day at a Time COL performer VAL George Hamilton IV	COL video title VAL Grant Green_I Remember You COL channel name VAL rapitroy COL description VAL Personnel: Grant Green (guitar); Wilbur Ware (bass); Al Harewood (drums) (1961)  Producer: Alfred Lion.  Reissue producer: Michael Cuscuna.  Recorded at the Van Gelder Studio\, Englewood Cliffs\, New Jersey on August 29\, 1961. Includes liner notes by Pete Welding.  Digitally remastered using 20-bit technology by Ron McMaster.  Grant Green has always been somewhat neglected in the pantheon of jazz guitarists. Lacking the flash of Wes Montgomery and the cerebral intensity of Jim Hall\, his strengths tended to be overlooked\, but these strengths are well exhibited on STANDARDS.  Green brings a geometric simplicity to the melody of "You Stepped Out of a Dream\," his solos unfolding with more light than heat. On Gershwin's charming "Love Walked In\," his solo tumbles gently through the changes. He pauses to reflect on a note now and then\, giving the time elasticity and looseness rather than propulsion. Bassist Wilbur Ware is similarly underrated. It's hard to understand why--his pulse and sense of the architecture of a tune are without parallel. His rock-solid time on the ballad "If I Had You" shows why he was held in such high esteem by other musicians. Green and Ware work together like a pair of safecrackers\, each deftly anticipating and complementing the moves of the other\, while drummer Al Harewood keeps steady watch. This set of terse\, swinging jazz goes a long way towards fixing Grant Green's place in the jazz guitar firmament.	0

DJ Sam Riddle on 12-25-65. Arranged by none other than Jack Nitzsche and produced by saxophonist extraordinaire Steve Douglas. Tony Hatch wrote many of Petula Clark's hits including "Downtown". This record introduced a new\, softer vocal style for Donna\, which was released by Capitol Records in 1965. Donna also performed this song live on The Milton Berle Show in a legitimate stage style in 1966 when she was a regular on the show. You will find that performance on YouTube if you go to my channel. "Call Me" was originally a hit for Petula Clark (UK) and Chris Montez (US).   Donna Loren was the one-and-only "Dr Pepper Girl" from 1963 to 1968. She was signed to a long-term contract with the soft-drink company to sing all television and radio commercials\, do all magazine and billboard advertising representing them in every capacity\, sometimes sharing the spotlight with American Bandstand's Dick Clark. This relationship led to her touring in Dick Clark's Caravan of Stars with other popular acts like Diana Ross and The Supremes and singing solos in the popular Beach Party films starring Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon. Later\, she became the regular female vocalist on the popular 60's American live rock n roll TV show "Shindig" and she appeared in singing and acting roles in many iconic TV shows like Batman\, The Monkees\, Gomer Pyle\, The Mothers-In-Law\, Red Skelton\, Milton Berle and various game shows. She's released 22 singles\, an album and 2 CD's. Ms Loren is currently in the studio again making music: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ-wN37G2rs  Current Videos: Donna Loren Now channel.

COL performer VAL James Blackwood and The Blackwood Brothers with Hovie Lister and The Statesmen	COL video title VAL Vince Guaraldi Trio - Christmas Time Is Here (Instrumental) COL channel name VAL VinceGuaraldiVEVO COL description VAL On December 9\, 1965\, A Charlie Brown Christmas aired on TV screens across America and instantly captured the hearts and ears of a generation. Bolstering the animated special\, based on Charles M. Schulz’s immensely popular PEANUTS comic strip\, was an engaging score from Bay Area jazz artist Vince Guaraldi\, who brought characters like Charlie Brown\, Lucy\, and Snoopy to life through his evocative cues.   Working primarily with bassist Fred Marshall and drummer Jerry Granelli\, Guaraldi paired inspired interpretations of traditional holiday fare (“O Tannenbaum\,” “Hark\, the Herald Angels Sing\,” and “What Child Is This”) with original compositions\, including the instantly recognizable “Linus and Lucy” theme\, “Skating\,” and “Christmas Time Is Here.” The latter song\, available as both an instrumental and vocal track\, featured young choral singers from St. Paul’s Episcopal Church in San Rafael\, CA.    More than five decades later\, the Emmy® and Peabody®-winning animated classic has spawned more than two dozen subsequent PEANUTS specials. Guaraldi’s soundtrack\, meanwhile\, has since become one of the best-selling jazz albums in history\, second only to Miles Davis’ Kind of Blue\, and regularly ranks among America’s top-selling holiday albums every December.

The band was originally formed in 1963 by guitarist Steve Fataar\, bassist Brother Fataar (real name Edries Fataar)\, drummer George Faber and guitarist Eugene Champion. However\, this line-up would only be together to record a couple of songs. Ricky Fataar replaced George Faber as the band's drummer around 1964 and Edries Fredericks replaced Eugene Champion as the guitarist. Baby Duval briefly replaced Edries Fredericks in 1967. Blondie Chaplin then replaced Baby Duval in 1967. This was to be the line-up from 1967 until their demise as a group in 1970. In 1972 Ricky Fataar and Blondie Chaplin joined The Beach Boys.  This song is off the album "Soulfire!!" released in 1968. It was written by Jimmy Campbell\, Reg Connelly and Harry M. Woods\, and recorded initially on December 8\, 1932 by the Ray Noble Orchestra (with vocals by Val Rosing)\, followed by both Ruth Etting and Bing Crosby in 1933. In South Africa the rendition by Percy Sledge is probably the best known version.	0

Lester E. (Les) Elgart comenzó a tocar la trompeta cuando era un adolescente\, y con 20 años de edad había ya realizado conciertos profesionales. En la década de 1940 tocó en las bandas dirigidas por Raymond Scott\, Charlie Spivak\, y Harry James\, y de vez en cuando en  bandas junto con el hermano Larry. Juntos crean la suya propia "Les & Larry Elgart Ensemble" en 1945\, y contratan a Nelson Riddle\, Ralph Flanagan\, y Bill Finegan para  hacer arreglos.  La unión fue efímera\, sin embargo\, debido a la huelga de Músicos de la Unión  y la disminución de la popularidad del jazz de Swing\, se separaron en 1946. En 1952\, el dúo se reunió y publicó un número importante de álbumes en Columbia Records\, muchos de considerable éxito de ventas.  Entre sus canciones más conocidas es "Bandstand Boogie"\, que fue utilizado por Dick Clark como la canción de "American Bandstand. Más tarde\, en la década de 1950 Les alejado de los negocios y la manipulación del grupo puso fin a la banda.  Les siguió trabajando hasta su muerte por insuficiencia cardíaca en Dallas\, Texas en 1995.

COL title VAL My Foolish Heart COL performer VAL The Ritz	COL video title VAL Celtic Mayhem ~ "The Wild Colonial Boy" (Australian version) ~ Miami FlaRF 2012 COL channel name VAL SeaWolfSong COL description VAL Celtic Mayhem performs the Australian version of "The Wild Colonial Boy" during their  Easter Morning set at the 2012 Miami Florida Renaissance Festival\, held at the historic Cauley Village Square in South Miami\, Florida.    Featuring Ty Billings on guitar with lead vocals\, Jack Stamates on fiddle\, and Martyn Wylde on bass guitar with supporting vocals.    For more information about Celtic Mayhem\, check out their website at:  www.celticmayhem.net  For more information about the Florida Renaissance Festival\, see: www.ren-fest.com  ==========================  "The Wild Colonial Boy" is a traditional song from the mid-nineteenth century\, with two primary versions (Irish and Australian) and numerous variants of each.    The original version was about Jack Donahue\, an Irish rebel who became a convict\, then a bushranger\, who was eventually shot down by police. This version was outlawed as seditious so the name changed.   The Australian version is quite different from the Irish version that is more commonly heard in the US and Europe. It is about a boy named Jack Doolan\, born in Castlemaine. The poem then continues on to tell of his exploits without mentioning his moving to Australia\, which implies that the Castlemaine in question is that in Victoria.  The exploits of the legendary Wild Colonial Boy is thought to be something of a composite of historical bushrangers of the era\, based primarily on "Bold Jack Donahue"\, with snippets of other infamous bushrangers such as Ned Kelly and others.  However\, there was a historical figure of a juvenile bushranger name Jack Doolan that may have also been a basis for the Australian version of the song.  Historical Scholar Allen Mawer has written extensively on the colonial and maritime history of Australia. His pamphlet on "The Life and Legend of Jack Doolan\, the Wild Colonial Boy" was published by Mulini Press\, Canberra\, in March 2004.    More historical information about both the famous song\, legend of the "Wild Colonial Boy"\, and the history of Australian bushrangers can be found at the Australian National Centre for Education at:  http://hyperhistory.org/index.php?option=displaypage&Itemid=674&op=page  ============================ Lyrics for a common variant of the Australian version of "The Wild Colonial Boy"  There was a wild Colonial Boy\, Jack Doolan was his name\, Of poor but honest parents\, He was born in Castlemaine. He was his father's only hope His mother's pride and joy\, And dearly did his parents love The Wild Colonial Boy.  At the age of sixteen years He left his native home\, And to Australia's sunny shores A bushranger did roam. They put him in the iron gang In the government employ\, But never an iron on earth could hold The Wild Colonial Boy  (CHORUS) So come away me hearties We'll roam the mountains high\, Together we will plunder And together we will die. We'll scour along the valleys And we'll gallop or'er the plains\, And scorn to live in slavery\, Bound down by iron chains.  In sixty-one this daring youth Commenced his wild career\, With a heart that knew no danger And no foreman did he fear. He stuck up the Beechworth mail coach And robbed Judge MacEvoy Who\, trembling cold\, gave up his gold To the Wild Colonial Boy  He bade the Judge good morning And he told him to beware\, That he'd never rob a needy man Or one who acted square\, But a Judge who'd robed a mother Of her one and only joy Sure\, he must be a worse outlaw than The Wild Colonial Boy  (CHORUS) So come away me hearties We'll roam the mountains high\, Together we will plunder And together we will die. We'll scour along the valleys And we'll gallop or'er the plains\, And scorn to live in slavery\, Bound down by iron chains.  One day as Jack was riding The mountainside along\, A- listening to the little birds Their happy laughing song. Three mounted troopers came along\, Kelly\, Davis and Fitzroy With a warrant for the capture of The Wild Colonial Boy.  'Surrender now! Jack Doolan\, For you see it's three to one; Surrender in the Queen's own name\, You are a highwayman.' Jack drew his pistol from his belt And waved it like a toy\, 'I'll fight\, but not surrender\,' cried The Wild Colonial Boy.  He fired at trooper Kelly And brought him to the ground\, And in return from Davis\, Received a mortal wound\, All shattered through the jaws he lay Still firing at Fitzroy\, And that's the way they captured him\, The Wild Colonial Boy.  (CHORUS) So come away me hearties We'll roam the mountains high\, Together we will plunder And together we will die. We'll scour along the valleys And we'll gallop or'er the plains\, And scorn to live in slavery\, Bound down by iron chains.	0

Come mothers and fathers Throughout the land And don't criticize What you can't understand Your sons and your daughters Are beyond your command Your old road is Rapidly agin' Please get out of the new one If you can't lend your hand For the times they are a-changin'.  The line it is drawn The curse it is cast The slow one now Will later be fast As the present now Will later be past The order is Rapidly fadin' And the first one now Will later be last For the times they are a-changin'	0

COL title VAL Firework COL performer VAL Tyler Ward / Alex Goot	COL video title VAL Elaine Stritch -- You Took Advantage of Me COL channel name VAL OldieMusicMan COL description VAL This is my favorite performance of "You Took Advantage of Me" out there. Even compared to other renditions of the same song by other powerhouse vocalists like Anita O'Day\, Bobby Short\, and my favorite jazz vocalist ever\, Ella Fitzgerald\, Elaine Stritch's remains my favorite. (My second favorite version is Judy Garland's performance in her "Born in a Trunk" medley; sadly\, it is disconnected\, not a through-and-through like it should have been). Her brassy\, throaty\, mostly straight-toned vocals seem those for which this song works best.  I hate that Elaine Stritch's voice has suffered as it has through time\, thanks to booze and cigarettes. In her prime\, she was as good a singer as anyone out there\, and ten times as unique. "C'est la vie" as our friends in France might say. We still have recordings like this to prove that\, at some point\, she WAS a singer.  ** I DO NOT OWN THE COPYRIGHT TO THIS RECORDING.

COL title VAL The Winner Takes It All COL performer VAL Siobhan McCarthy	COL video title VAL Mandy - barry manilow COL channel name VAL kaattz COL description VAL Barry Manilow (born June 17\, 1943) is an American singer-songwriter\, musician\, arranger\, producer and conductor\, best known for such recordings as "I Write the Songs"\, "Mandy"\, "Weekend in New England" and "Copacabana". Manilow's achievements include sales of more than 76 million records worldwide. In 1978\, five of his albums were on the best-selling charts simultaneously\, a feat equalled only by Frank Sinatra\, Michael Jackson and Johnny Mathis. He has recorded a string of Billboard hit singles and multi-platinum albums that have resulted in his being named Radio & Records number one Adult Contemporary artist and winning three straight American Music Awards for Favourite Pop/Rock Male Artist. Several well-known entertainers have given Manilow their "stamp of approval\," including Sinatra\, who was quoted in the 1970s regarding Manilow\, "He's next." In 1988\, Bob Dylan stopped Manilow at a party\, hugged him and said\, "Don't stop what you're doing\, man. We're all inspired by you." Arsenio Hall cited Manilow as a favourite guest on The Arsenio Hall Show and admonished his audience to respect him for his work.   LYRICS: I remember all my life rainin' down as cold as ice Shadows of a man a face through a window Cryin' in the night the night goes into morning. Just another day  happy people pass my way Looking in their eyes I see a memory I never realized how happy you made me. Oh Mandy well you came and you gave without taking But I sent you away oh Mandy Well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking And I need you today oh Mandy. I'm standing on the edge of time I've walked away when love was mine Caught up in a world of up-hill climbing The tears are in my mind and nothing is rhyming. Oh Mandy well you came and you gave without taking Yesterday's a dream-l face the morning Crying on a breeze the pain is calling Oh Mandy well you came and you gave without taking	0

Mildred Bailey (February 27\, 1907 -- December 12\, 1951) was a popular and influential American jazz singer during the 1930s\, known as "The Rockin' Chair Lady" and "Mrs. Swing". Her number one hits were "Please Be Kind"\, "Darn That Dream"\, "Rockin' Chair" and "Says My Heart". In the mid 1930s\, she recorded with her third husband Red Norvo. A dynamic couple\, they earned the nicknames "Mr. and Mrs. Swing". During this period (1936--1939) Norvo recorded for Brunswick (with Bailey as primary vocalist) and Bailey recorded her own set of recordings for Vocalion\, often with Norvo's band. Some of her recordings instead featured members of Count Basie's band. Despite her divorce from Norvo\, she and Red would continue to record together until 1945. Suffering from diabetes and depression (during her adult life Bailey was overweight)\, she only made a few recordings following World War II.  Mildred Bailey died December 12\, 1951\, in Poughkeepsie\, New York\, of heart failure\, aged 44\, chiefly due to her diabetes. Her ashes were scattered. Red Norvo outlived Bailey by nearly half a century\, dying in April 1999\, a week after his 91st birthday. "I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You" is a 1932 song composed by Victor Young\, with lyrics written by Ned Washington and Bing Crosby\, recorded on October 14\, 1932 by Bing Crosby in New York. In 1939\, Mildred Bailey fronted a six-side\, mostly blues session as "Mildred Bailey and her Oxford Greys" for Vocalion\, which featured a small mixed-race combo of Mary Lou Williams (piano)\, Floyd Smith (electric guitar)\, John Williams (bass) and Eddie Dougherty (drums).	0

History  Initially released on Bang Records in April 1966\, "Solitary Man" was Diamond's debut single as a recording artist having already had moderate success as a songwriter for other artists. By July\, the track had become a minor hit rising to #55 on the U.S. pop singles chart. It would then be included on Diamond's first album\, The Feel of Neil Diamond\, released in August 1966.  While nominally about young romantic failure\, parts of the lyric:  Don't know that I will\, But until\, I can find me ... I'll be\, what I am — A solitary man ... Solitary man.  have been closely identified with Diamond himself\, as evinced by a 2008 profile in The Daily Telegraph: "This is the Solitary Man depicted on his first hit in 1966: the literate\, thoughtful and melodically adventurous composer of songs that cover a vast array of moods and emotions..." Indeed\, Diamond himself would tell interviewers in the 2000s\, "After four years of Freudian analysis I realised I had written 'Solitary Man' about myself."  "Solitary Man's" dynamic melody\, matched with the melancholic universality of its lyrics\, would make the song an attractive target for later interpretations.  After Diamond had renewed commercial success with Uni Records at the end of the decade\, Bang Records re-released "Solitary Man" as a single and it reached #21 on the U.S. pop charts in summer 1970.  He originally recorded two versions of the song\, as he later did with "Cherry\, Cherry." One of them had his harmonic vocal track on the Chorus of the song. The other version was him singing the song alone\, without his prerecorded harmony on the track.  On such live albums as Gold: Recorded Live at the Troubadour\, Hot August Night and some subsequent recordings\, Diamond altered the lyrics to "then you came along" from the original "then Sue came along."  In a 2005 Rolling Stone retrospective\, Dan Epstein wrote\, "'Solitary Man' remains the most brilliantly efficient song in the Diamond collection. There's not a wasted word or chord in this two-and-a-half minute anthem of heartbreak and self-affirmation\, which introduced the melancholy loner persona that he's repeatedly returned to throughout his career."  Cover versions  In 1976\, T. G. Sheppard released a cover version for Hitsville Records. It went to #14 on the country music charts (Hot Country Songs) and #100 on the Hot 100.  In 1966\, famous Italian singer Gianni Morandi recorded a cover version titled "Se perdo anche te" ("If I lose you too"). The author of the Italian lyrics was Franco Migliacci\, who was Morandi's producer at that time and who\, eight years before\, had written the lyrics to Domenico Modugno's international hit "Nel blu\, dipinto di blu (Volare)." This song was arranged by Ennio Morricone\, who at that time conducted many tunes published by the Italian RCA Victor\, and was the B-Side of "C'era un ragazzo che come me amava i Beatles e i Rolling Stones" ("There was a boy who\, like me\, loved the Beatles and the Rolling Stones")\, a song against the Vietnam War.  The Tucson\, Arizona alternative rock band The Sidewinders added a version of the song as the fifth track on their 1989 hit album Witchdoctor.  Chris Isaak covered "Solitary Man" as the last track of his 1993 album San Francisco Days. The music video for the song was directed by Larry Clark.  Johnny Cash used "Solitary Man" for the title track of his 3rd American Recordings album in 2000. The recording received a Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance. His recording of the song was used in the penultimate episode of Stargate Atlantis\, "Vegas." The recording was also used for the opening credits of the film "Solitary Man" (2010) starring Michael Douglas.  In 2004\, the Finnish band HIM covered "Solitary Man" for their first compilation album\, And Love Said No: The Greatest Hits 1997--2004. It was released as a single and a music video\, produced by Bam Margera\, was created.  The band Crooked Fingers covered it on their 5 track EP of cover songs\, the Reservoir Songs EP.  Cliff Richard recorded Solitary Man for his 1966 EP La La La La La.  Skin Flesh & Bones recorded a reggae cover of it on their 1974 7" release.  Tony Carey covered Solitary Man on his album Only the Young Die Good and on the album The Boystown Tapes.  Jussi Syren And The Groundbreakers recorded a bluegrass version on their album Heartagrass - An Acoustic Tribute To HIM\, a tribute to fellow Finnish performers HIM  Billy Joe Royal Jay and the Americans Johnny Rivers and Ólöf Arnalds.	0

Etta Jones was an American jazz singer whose critical success and relative commercial obscurity earned her a reputation in her lifetime as a "jazz musician's jazz singer". A highly underrated singer who rarely received the recognition she richly deserved\, perhaps the salient mark of her obscurity was the number of times even followers of the female jazz vocal scene would confuse her with a more popular singer\, Etta James. Etta Jones is noted for her elegant interpretations of standards\, ballads\, and blues. Her characteristic inflections have sometimes prompted comparisons to stylistic devices employed by Billie Holiday and Dinah Washington.  Etta's accompanied by Frank Wess\, (flute\, tenor saxophone)\, Richard Wyands\, (piano)\, Skeeter Best (guitar)\,  George Duvivier (bass) and Roy Haynes (drums).  Recorded June 21\, 1960. (Prestige Records)  Build your dreams to the stars above But when you need someone true to love Don't go to strangers\, darling\, come on to me  Play with fire 'til your fingers burn And when there's no place for you to turn Don't go to strangers\, darling\, come on to me  For\, when you hear a call to follow your heart You follow your heart\, I know I've been through it all and I'm an old hand And I'll understand if you go  So make your mark for your friends to see But when you need more than company Don't go to strangers\, come on to me  Oh\, make your mark for your friends to see But when you need more than company Don't go to strangers\, darling\, come on to me	0

COL title VAL Fire and Rain COL performer VAL Christopher Phillips	COL video title VAL Nana Mouskouri - Fire and Rain COL channel name VAL perek5 COL description VAL Song from the album "The three bells" (1976)\, originally sung by James Taylor. Lyrics:  Just yesterday mornin' they let me know you were gone\, Susan\, the plans they made put an end to you. I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song\, I just can't remember who to send it to.  Cho: I've seen fire and I've seen rain\, I seen sunny days that I thought would never end\, I seen lonely times when I could not find a friend\, But I always thought I'd see you again.  Won't you look down upon me Jesus\, you've got to help me make a stand\, Just got to see me through another day. My body's aching and my time is at hand\, And I can't make it any other way.  Been walkin' my mind to an easy time\, my back turned toward the sun\, Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around. Well\, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come\, Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground.	1

COL title VAL Besame mucho COL performer VAL Pascal Comelade	COL video title VAL Besame Mucho by Trio Los Panchos COL channel name VAL gu7196 COL description VAL Music & lyrics written by Consuelo Velasquez of Mexico in 1941. According to Velasquez\, the song was inspired by an aria from an opera by Enrique Granados\, a Spanish composer and pianist of classical music. Played by Trio Los Panchos\, whether this was the first version I'm not sure but I found this version is the best version I've ever heard so far\, particularly their outstanding guitar arrangement.  The lyric goes :  Bésame\, bésame mucho como si fuera esta noche la última vez\, bésame\, bésame mucho que tengo miedo perderte perderte después.

The look of love  Is in your eyes  A look your smile can't  disguise   The look of love  Is saying so much more than  Just words could every say  And what my heart has heard  Well it takes my breath away   [Chorus]  I can hardly wait to hold you  Feel my arms around you  How long I have waited  Waited just to love you  Now that I have found you   You've got the look of love  It's on your face  A look that time can't erase  Baby be mine\, tonight   Let this be just the start of  So many nights like this  Let's take a lovers vow  And seal it with a kiss   [Chorus]   Don't ever go  Don't ever go  I love you so  The look of love   Let this be just the start of  So many nights like this  Let's take a lover's vow  And baby we'll seal it with a kiss   [Chorus]	0

It was released in 1966 by The Cyrkle and I think it went to #2 on the charts. It was the second track on The Feel Of Neil. I would like to thank sunshinetunes67 for helping me find this mp3. If you have never been to sunshinetunes67's channel I highly recommend it. You will hear some old songs you cant hear anywhere else. He has an amazing collection of some familiar and some never heard. It was fun for me making this video; I was trying a little animation which requires a lot of images to do. I look at it and think it might be a little hokey but when I see that ball come through the hoop it makes me smile. I sometime like to morph my images one into the next and sometimes I am lazy and use a program that makes the movie for me I just put the images in and choose the style.	0

DJ Sam Riddle on 12-25-65. Arranged by none other than Jack Nitzsche and produced by saxophonist extraordinaire Steve Douglas. Tony Hatch wrote many of Petula Clark's hits including "Downtown". This record introduced a new\, softer vocal style for Donna\, which was released by Capitol Records in 1965. Donna also performed this song live on The Milton Berle Show in a legitimate stage style in 1966 when she was a regular on the show. You will find that performance on YouTube if you go to my channel. "Call Me" was originally a hit for Petula Clark (UK) and Chris Montez (US).   Donna Loren was the one-and-only "Dr Pepper Girl" from 1963 to 1968. She was signed to a long-term contract with the soft-drink company to sing all television and radio commercials\, do all magazine and billboard advertising representing them in every capacity\, sometimes sharing the spotlight with American Bandstand's Dick Clark. This relationship led to her touring in Dick Clark's Caravan of Stars with other popular acts like Diana Ross and The Supremes and singing solos in the popular Beach Party films starring Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon. Later\, she became the regular female vocalist on the popular 60's American live rock n roll TV show "Shindig" and she appeared in singing and acting roles in many iconic TV shows like Batman\, The Monkees\, Gomer Pyle\, The Mothers-In-Law\, Red Skelton\, Milton Berle and various game shows. She's released 22 singles\, an album and 2 CD's. Ms Loren is currently in the studio again making music: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ-wN37G2rs  Current Videos: Donna Loren Now channel.

Jim Hall and Joe Pass had somewhat of a professional rivalry throughout the 70's-early 80's\, often trading places atop Down Beat Magazine's annual Best Of poll. Although they are stylistically very different\, there are many overlaps in their bodies of work\, which makes for an interesting comparison/contrast.

COL title VAL Christmas Time Is Here COL performer VAL Mark Kozelek	COL video title VAL Vince Guaraldi Trio - Christmas Time Is Here (Instrumental) COL channel name VAL VinceGuaraldiVEVO COL description VAL On December 9\, 1965\, A Charlie Brown Christmas aired on TV screens across America and instantly captured the hearts and ears of a generation. Bolstering the animated special\, based on Charles M. Schulz’s immensely popular PEANUTS comic strip\, was an engaging score from Bay Area jazz artist Vince Guaraldi\, who brought characters like Charlie Brown\, Lucy\, and Snoopy to life through his evocative cues.   Working primarily with bassist Fred Marshall and drummer Jerry Granelli\, Guaraldi paired inspired interpretations of traditional holiday fare (“O Tannenbaum\,” “Hark\, the Herald Angels Sing\,” and “What Child Is This”) with original compositions\, including the instantly recognizable “Linus and Lucy” theme\, “Skating\,” and “Christmas Time Is Here.” The latter song\, available as both an instrumental and vocal track\, featured young choral singers from St. Paul’s Episcopal Church in San Rafael\, CA.    More than five decades later\, the Emmy® and Peabody®-winning animated classic has spawned more than two dozen subsequent PEANUTS specials. Guaraldi’s soundtrack\, meanwhile\, has since become one of the best-selling jazz albums in history\, second only to Miles Davis’ Kind of Blue\, and regularly ranks among America’s top-selling holiday albums every December.

COL title VAL Last Christmas COL performer VAL Mek & the X-mas Peks	COL video title VAL The Flames - Try a little tenderness COL channel name VAL keurspel (Leon Rossouw) COL description VAL The Flames was a musical group from Durban in South Africa. The band was originally formed in 1963 by guitarist Steve Fataar\, bassist Brother Fataar (real name Edries Fataar)\, drummer George Faber and guitarist Eugene Champion. However\, this line-up would only be together to record a couple of songs. Ricky Fataar replaced George Faber as the band's drummer around 1964 and Edries Fredericks replaced Eugene Champion as the guitarist. Baby Duval briefly replaced Edries Fredericks in 1967. Blondie Chaplin then replaced Baby Duval in 1967. This was to be the line-up from 1967 until their demise as a group in 1970. In 1972 Ricky Fataar and Blondie Chaplin joined The Beach Boys.  This song is off the album "Soulfire!!" released in 1968. It was written by Jimmy Campbell\, Reg Connelly and Harry M. Woods\, and recorded initially on December 8\, 1932 by the Ray Noble Orchestra (with vocals by Val Rosing)\, followed by both Ruth Etting and Bing Crosby in 1933. In South Africa the rendition by Percy Sledge is probably the best known version.	0

Also called "House of the Rising Sun" or occasionally "Rising Sun Blues"\, it tells of a life gone wrong in New Orleans.  As is the case with many folk ballads\, the authorship of 'The house of the Rising Sun' remains conjectural. Folklorist Alan Lomax in his book 'Our singing Country'\, states that the melody comes from a traditional 17th Century English ballad with the 20th century lyrics written by two Kentuckians\, Georgia Turner and Bert Martin.	1

COL title VAL The Hunter COL performer VAL Albert King	COL video title VAL François Glorieux plays The Beatles - 03 - Can't buy me love (Gershwin/Prokofiev) COL channel name VAL François Miet COL description VAL Improvisation on "Can't buy me love" in the style of George Gershwin and Sergei Prokofiev. La plus grande originalité de cet étonnant LP réside sans doute dans le fait que chaque pièce a été entièrement improvisée. En d'autres termes : jouée spontanément sans préparation\, ni partition. Si François Glorieux est le seul pianiste de notre XXè siècle à s'être aventuré aussi loin dans le domaine de l'improvisation\, il ne révèle ici qu'UN des des multiples aspects de ce "grand art" qu'il pratique comme personne : l'improvisation de style. Et cela tient du miracle! Loin de se contenter d'un "pastiche à la manière de ..."\, il nous démontre comment les noms illustres de l'histoire de la musique auraient pu traiter les admirables mélodies des Beatles. Certains thèmes ont été reproduits intégralement\, d'autres ont été légèrement modifiés ou adaptés à l'image même du compositeur! Et on chercherait en vain un défaut de style ou de construction\, une faute de goût\, une lacune. Comme le disait si bien un critique musical allemand : " François Glorieux est en quelque sorte le faux-monnayeur de l'improvisation\, car c'est si parfait\, si réussi\, qu'on ne sait s'il joue le vrai ou le faux."	0

COL title VAL All Alone COL performer VAL Rosemary Clooney	COL video title VAL Mildred Bailey - I Don't Stand A Ghost Of A Chance With You - 1939 COL channel name VAL warholsoup100 COL description VAL Vintage Radio Slideshow. Mildred Bailey (February 27\, 1907 -- December 12\, 1951) was a popular and influential American jazz singer during the 1930s\, known as "The Rockin' Chair Lady" and "Mrs. Swing". Her number one hits were "Please Be Kind"\, "Darn That Dream"\, "Rockin' Chair" and "Says My Heart". In the mid 1930s\, she recorded with her third husband Red Norvo. A dynamic couple\, they earned the nicknames "Mr. and Mrs. Swing". During this period (1936--1939) Norvo recorded for Brunswick (with Bailey as primary vocalist) and Bailey recorded her own set of recordings for Vocalion\, often with Norvo's band. Some of her recordings instead featured members of Count Basie's band. Despite her divorce from Norvo\, she and Red would continue to record together until 1945. Suffering from diabetes and depression (during her adult life Bailey was overweight)\, she only made a few recordings following World War II.  Mildred Bailey died December 12\, 1951\, in Poughkeepsie\, New York\, of heart failure\, aged 44\, chiefly due to her diabetes. Her ashes were scattered. Red Norvo outlived Bailey by nearly half a century\, dying in April 1999\, a week after his 91st birthday. "I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You" is a 1932 song composed by Victor Young\, with lyrics written by Ned Washington and Bing Crosby\, recorded on October 14\, 1932 by Bing Crosby in New York. In 1939\, Mildred Bailey fronted a six-side\, mostly blues session as "Mildred Bailey and her Oxford Greys" for Vocalion\, which featured a small mixed-race combo of Mary Lou Williams (piano)\, Floyd Smith (electric guitar)\, John Williams (bass) and Eddie Dougherty (drums).	0

COL title VAL Iris COL performer VAL Iron Horse [1]	COL video title VAL Ramsey Lewis Trio - Here Comes Santa Claus (Argo Records 1961) COL channel name VAL ChristmasTimeTV COL description VAL "Here Comes Santa Claus (Right Down Santa Claus Lane)" is a Christmas song written by Gene Autry and Oakley Haldeman.  Autry got the idea for the song after riding his horse in the 1946 Santa Claus Lane Parade in Los Angeles\, during which crowds of spectators chanted\, "Here comes Santa Claus". This inspired him to write a song that Haldeman set to music. A demo recording was made by singer/guitarist Johnny Bond\, whose recording made use of ice cubes to mimic the sound of the jingling sleigh-bells. This inspired the use of real sleigh-bells in Autry's own recording of the song.   Here comes Santa Claus\, here comes Santa Claus\,  Right down Santa Claus lane  Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer  Pullin' on the reins  Bells are ringin'\, children singin'  All is merry and bright  Hang your stockings and say your prayers  'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight!   Here comes Santa Claus\, here comes Santa Claus\,  Right down Santa Claus lane  He's got a bag that's filled with toys  For boys and girls again  Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle\,  Oh what a beautiful sight  So jump in bed and cover your head  'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight!   Here comes Santa Claus\, here comes Santa Claus\,  Right down Santa Claus lane  He doesn't care if you're rich or poor  He loves you just the same  Santa Claus knows we're all Gods children  That makes everything right  So fill your hearts with Christmas cheer  'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight!   Here comes Santa Claus\, here comes Santa Claus\,  Right down Santa Claus lane  He'll come around when the chimes ring out  That it's Christmas morn again  Peace on earth will come to all If we just follow the light  So lets give thanks to the lord above  That Santa Claus comes tonight!	0

Digitally reissued\, and on CD\, on Waiata Vol1: Maori Showbands\, Balladeers and Popstars compilation put together by Grant Gillanders (EMI NZ).The song was originally made famous by Brenton Wood.   Bio from Amplifier.co.nz\, who have two digital albums of nhis recordings available... http://www.amplifier.co.nz/artist/20358/nash-chase.html?full=1   "Born in Taihape\, Nash Chase entered the New Zealand pop scene in 1970 with a top ten single What greater Love which peaked on the national chart at number ten. Nash came from a large family of eighteen brothers and sisters and all were musically inclined so it was no surprise when he decided on a career in entertainment.  In 1971 Nash entered the Studio One TV contest and ended up as winner of the New Faces section\, which resulted in a recording contract with EMI. His first single for the label Today I Killed A Man I Didn't Know became an immediate top twenty hit and was a finalist in the 1971 Loxene Gold Disc Awards.   The follow-up releases If You'd Like To Be A Lady\, Eye For The main Chance\, and Anderson And Wise also became winners with Anderson And Wise reaching the finals of the 1972 Studio One Contest.   With his commercial appeal Nash was always a favourite with radio and his final single release Maria Isabella also became a finalist in the 1973 RATA Awards.   In February 1973 Nash Chase and his wife decided to leave New Zealand for the entertainment circuit in Australia and although EMI there released a selection of singles over the following year he was unable to break into the lucrative Sydney scene."	0

COL title VAL Pillowtalk COL performer VAL Boyce Avenue	COL video title VAL Vaughn Monroe and His Orchestra - The Trolley Song (1944) COL channel name VAL CatsPjamas1 COL description VAL Charted at #4 in December 1944. Vocals by Vaughn Monroe and Marilyn Duke. B-side of "The Very Thought of You". From the film\, "Meet Me in St. Louis" where the song was introduced by Judy Garland. Original Billboard review: "In the rush to be the first to reach the record marts\, the waxwork was tardy in getting its initial release out for the judgement of reviewers. By every commercial standard\, it's a good commercial record\, what with the highly popular "The Trolley Song"\, with Vaughn Monroe and Marilyn Duke sharing the wordage\, to tee off".   Also #2 for the Pied Pipers in October 1944\, #4 for Judy Garland in November 1944\, #13 for the Four King Sisters in November 1944 and #19 for Guy Lombardo and His Royal Canadians in January 1945.

Speaking on recording the album Benson says\, "I felt every moment of it. You can't put together a record like this without putting your heart into it. I got that from Nat King Cole. He put his heart into everything he did."	0

It takes a great singer to really do justice to Dylan\, yet KT goes well beyond that and makes this her own. She's just that good live.  I work nights in a television studio and used to come home in the morning to find absolutely nothing interesting to watch on television. The last thing I wanted to see was more commercials. And I'm not really interested in watching talk shows and soap operas.  Then I discovered the commercial free music channel RAVE. HD quality video and pretty much perfect 5.1 sound. A few times a week they run "Later With Jools Holland" in the morning. Jools has great taste in music and each show runs the gamut from pop\, rock\, folk\, Celtic\, African\, to Joanna Newsome. Something for everyone. Suffice to say I love this show.  Uploaded as a high quality 640 x 480 MPEG4 file using Pinnacle Studio.

Where is the land beyond the eye That people cannot see? Where can it be?  Where do stars go? Where is the crescent moon? They must be somewhere  Here in the sunny afternoon.  Alice in Wonderland. Where is the path to Wonderland? Over the hill or here or there? I wonder where.  *Thanks for watching!*	0

Il faisait la guerre avec ses amis Dedans la fumée\, Dedans les métros\, Dedans les pavés\, Dedans les bistrots. Il ne savait pas qu'il en était saoûl. Il ne savait pas qu'il dormait debout. Paris le tenait par la peau du cou.  {Refrain:} Ah ! Les pommiers doux\, Rondes et ritournelles. J'ai pas peur des loups\, Chantonnait la belle. Ils ne sont pas méchants Avec les enfants Qu'ont le cœur fidèle Et les genoux blancs...  Sous un pommier doux\, il l'a retrouvée\, Croisant le soleil avec la rosée. Vivent les chansons pour les Bien-aimées. Je me souviens d'elle au sang de velours. Elle avait des mains qui parlaient d'amour Et tressait l'argile avec les nuages Et pressait le vent contre son visage Pour en exprimer l'huile des voyages.  {Refrain}  "Adieu mon Paris"\, dit le chevalier. "J'ai dormi cent ans\, debout sans manger Les pommes d'argent de mes doux pommiers." Alors le village a crié si fort Que toutes les filles ont couru dehors Mais le chevalier n'a salué qu'elle Au sang de velours\, au cœur tant fidèle\, Chevalier fera la guerre en dentelles.  {Refrain}	0

COL title VAL Pop Corn COL performer VAL Fausto Papetti	COL video title VAL Coba - Popcorn (Gershon Kingsley Cover) COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven COL description VAL From '' Popcorn '' Label: DA Records -- DA 455.083 Format: Vinyl\, 12" Country: Germany Released: 1990  Tracklist A    Popcorn (Fresh Hot 90' Mix) B1 Pancake B2 Popcorn (Radio Version)  ------------------------  "Popcorn" is an early electronic pop instrumental\, originally composed by Gershon Kingsley in 1969 on his album Music to Moog By. The same year this tune was released and recorded at Audio Fidelity Records label in New York City.  In 1972\, Hot Butter's rerecording was a huge hit in many countries. That version is by far the most well-known of this tune. The tune was very popular in the Soviet Union and was featured in one of the Nu\, pogodi! animated series.  Original version - Background  Composer Gershon Kingsley (of Perrey and Kingsley) first recorded it for his 1969 album Music to Moog By. In 1971 the song was re-recorded by Kingsley's band First Moog Quartet. Stan Free\, member of the First Moog Quartet\, rerecorded the instrumental with his band Hot Butter in 1972.  The title refers to the short staccato or sharp "popping" sound used.  Other cover versions  It has since been covered by various artists\, including: DJ Voyager\, Anarchic System with vocal version\, a pre-fame Jean Michel Jarre (under the pseudonyms of The Popcorn Orchestra and Jamie Jefferson)\, Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops\, Unter Null\, Richard D. James AKA Aphex Twin\, M&H Band\, Muse\, DJ Fantomas\, Gigi D'Agostino\, Guru Josh\, Iranian artist Shadmehr Aghili\, Afrosound\, The Time Frequency (TTF)\, Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass\, Norrie Paramor & the Midland Radio Orchestra\, Ronnie Aldrich\, The Treble Spankers\, the Boomtang Boys\, Space Penguins\, Pattie Brooks (disco version as part of a medley that also included Black is Black & Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye)\, Bass Bumpers (fronted by the Crazy Frog cartoon)\, Liars\, Finnish band Seidat\, Swedish DJ Richi M\, the Irish DJ Showey\, South African Psytrance act Parana\, Italian pop band La Strana Società\, Japanese electronic artists Denki Groove\, Russian Virtuoso Guitar Player Victor Zinchuk\, Spanish rock band Los Pekenikes\, Shadowy Men On A Shadowy Planet and the Swedish Chef.  It has also been remixed by Hexstatic on the Pick 'n' Mix album. In 2003 Greek synthpop Duo Marsheaux released a darker mix of "Popcorn" as their debut single\, which became a radio play hit in Europe. The song was also featured as the background music in the first version of the 1982 arcade game Pengo\, the 1983 IBM PC game Digger\, and the 1984 Mikro-Gen microcomputer game Pyjamarama.  Many cover versions were made on popular home computers such as Atari\, ZX Spectrum\, Commodore 64 and Amiga\, often by anonymous artists. On the 17th of September\, 2007\, Electropop group Plemo released a free track on micromusic.net based on the original "Popcorn" melody. It includes samples from "(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)" of the Beastie Boys. In 1976\, the tenth episode of Nu\, Pogodi! includes this song as Volk (The Wolf) tries to get closer and closer to Zayats (The Hare) at a construction site.  Big band arranger James Last recorded "Popcorn" in 1972  The song has never been covered by Kraftwerk although there are mistagged copies of the song allegedly by them (most frequently the version by M&H Band) in circulation. There is also a version circulating on the internet that is claimed to have been made by avant-garde group The Residents even though it sounds vastly different from The Residents' usual experimental sound. This version is actually made by the hard house artists called The Rezidents\, hence the confusion between the two.  A variation of "Popcorn" was used by WDIV in Detroit\, Michigan as background music for the station's Michigan Lottery Lotto drawings during the 1980s.  Most recently\, alternative rock band Muse performed this song live in Teignmouth\, UK during their two nights at The Den. The song featured prominent electric guitar along with heavy percussion and bass. A studio version of their cover was released on the 2010 single "Resistance". Faith No More covered the song live in Argentina in The Second Coming Tour.  The Muppets recorded a cover of the song featuring it as the theme of a new Swedish Chef sketch\, hence its naming as Pöpcørn\, which was released in July 2010.  Other uses  The song was used in the 1982 arcade game Pengo and the next year in the PC video game Digger.	1

Baby can't be broken\,because you see.She had the finest teacher.That was me.I told her  Chorus  Don't cry out loud.Just keep inside.And learn how to hide your feelings.Fly high and proud. And if you should fall\,remember you almost had it all.  Don't cry out loud.Just keep inside.And learn how to hide your feelings.Fly high and proud.

COL title VAL Lush Life COL performer VAL Ann Hampton Callaway	COL video title VAL Etta Jones - Don't Go To Strangers (Prestige Records 1960) COL channel name VAL RoundMidnightTV COL description VAL "Don't Go To Strangers" is a 1954 song by Arthur Kent with lyrics by Redd Evans.  Etta Jones was an American jazz singer whose critical success and relative commercial obscurity earned her a reputation in her lifetime as a "jazz musician's jazz singer". A highly underrated singer who rarely received the recognition she richly deserved\, perhaps the salient mark of her obscurity was the number of times even followers of the female jazz vocal scene would confuse her with a more popular singer\, Etta James. Etta Jones is noted for her elegant interpretations of standards\, ballads\, and blues. Her characteristic inflections have sometimes prompted comparisons to stylistic devices employed by Billie Holiday and Dinah Washington.  Etta's accompanied by Frank Wess\, (flute\, tenor saxophone)\, Richard Wyands\, (piano)\, Skeeter Best (guitar)\,  George Duvivier (bass) and Roy Haynes (drums).  Recorded June 21\, 1960. (Prestige Records)  Build your dreams to the stars above But when you need someone true to love Don't go to strangers\, darling\, come on to me  Play with fire 'til your fingers burn And when there's no place for you to turn Don't go to strangers\, darling\, come on to me  For\, when you hear a call to follow your heart You follow your heart\, I know I've been through it all and I'm an old hand And I'll understand if you go  So make your mark for your friends to see But when you need more than company Don't go to strangers\, come on to me  Oh\, make your mark for your friends to see But when you need more than company Don't go to strangers\, darling\, come on to me	0

COL title VAL Body and Soul COL performer VAL Stan Getz	COL video title VAL Theme from 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (MGM Album) - Sung by Debbie Gravitte COL channel name VAL Debbie Gravitte COL description VAL MP3 ► http://DebbieTunes.com ► http://facebook.com/DebbieGravitte   Info ►http://DebbieGravitte.com  Theme from 2001: A Space Odyssey.  Sung by Debbie Gravitte. That's correct\, SUNG by Debbie!  You can download this song from her album "The MGM Album"\, which includes songs from all the great MGM films of the past.  Music plays a crucial part in 2001\, and not only because of the relatively sparse dialogue. From very early on in production\, Kubrick decided that he wanted the film to be a primarily non-verbal experience\,one that did not rely on the traditional techniques of narrative cinema\, and in which music would play a vital role in evoking particular moods. About half the music in the film appears either before the first line of dialogue or after the final line. Almost no music is heard during any scenes with dialogue.  The film is remarkable for its innovative use of classical music taken from existing commercial recordings. Most feature films then and now are typically accompanied by elaborate film scores or songs written especially for them by professional composers. In the early stages of production\, Kubrick had actually commissioned a score for 2001 from noted Hollywood composer Alex North\, who had written the score for Spartacus and also worked on Dr. Strangelove.  However\, during post-production\, Kubrick chose to abandon North's music in favor of the now-familiar classical music pieces he had earlier chose as "guide pieces" for the soundtrack. North did not know of the abandonment of the score until after he saw the film's premiere screening.  The initial MGM soundtrack album release contained none of the material from the altered and uncredited rendition of "Aventures"\, used a different recording of "Also Sprach Zarathustra" than that heard in the film\, and a longer excerpt of "Lux Aeterna" than that in the film.

COL title VAL Someone to Watch over Me COL performer VAL Benny Green	COL video title VAL KT Tunstall "Tangled Up In Blue" Jools Holland RAVE HD COL channel name VAL HiHo44 COL description VAL This is KT Tunstall covering the Bob Dylan tune "Tangled Up In Blue" on "Later With Jools Holland". It takes a great singer to really do justice to Dylan\, yet KT goes well beyond that and makes this her own. She's just that good live.  I work nights in a television studio and used to come home in the morning to find absolutely nothing interesting to watch on television. The last thing I wanted to see was more commercials. And I'm not really interested in watching talk shows and soap operas.  Then I discovered the commercial free music channel RAVE. HD quality video and pretty much perfect 5.1 sound. A few times a week they run "Later With Jools Holland" in the morning. Jools has great taste in music and each show runs the gamut from pop\, rock\, folk\, Celtic\, African\, to Joanna Newsome. Something for everyone. Suffice to say I love this show.  Uploaded as a high quality 640 x 480 MPEG4 file using Pinnacle Studio.

COL title VAL Last Christmas COL performer VAL Carole King	COL video title VAL Ramsey Lewis Trio - Here Comes Santa Claus (Argo Records 1961) COL channel name VAL ChristmasTimeTV COL description VAL "Here Comes Santa Claus (Right Down Santa Claus Lane)" is a Christmas song written by Gene Autry and Oakley Haldeman.  Autry got the idea for the song after riding his horse in the 1946 Santa Claus Lane Parade in Los Angeles\, during which crowds of spectators chanted\, "Here comes Santa Claus". This inspired him to write a song that Haldeman set to music. A demo recording was made by singer/guitarist Johnny Bond\, whose recording made use of ice cubes to mimic the sound of the jingling sleigh-bells. This inspired the use of real sleigh-bells in Autry's own recording of the song.   Here comes Santa Claus\, here comes Santa Claus\,  Right down Santa Claus lane  Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer  Pullin' on the reins  Bells are ringin'\, children singin'  All is merry and bright  Hang your stockings and say your prayers  'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight!   Here comes Santa Claus\, here comes Santa Claus\,  Right down Santa Claus lane  He's got a bag that's filled with toys  For boys and girls again  Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle\,  Oh what a beautiful sight  So jump in bed and cover your head  'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight!   Here comes Santa Claus\, here comes Santa Claus\,  Right down Santa Claus lane  He doesn't care if you're rich or poor  He loves you just the same  Santa Claus knows we're all Gods children  That makes everything right  So fill your hearts with Christmas cheer  'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight!   Here comes Santa Claus\, here comes Santa Claus\,  Right down Santa Claus lane  He'll come around when the chimes ring out  That it's Christmas morn again  Peace on earth will come to all If we just follow the light  So lets give thanks to the lord above  That Santa Claus comes tonight!	0

COL title VAL Over the Rainbow COL performer VAL Becky Taylor	COL video title VAL an "OVER THE RAINBOW" like no other -- by vocalist  EMILY HADDAD COL channel name VAL TheMotiondevotion COL description VAL Emily's 1991 CD (now out-of-print) can be purchased HERE: http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=372565620256  "Over the Rainbow" is one of the most well-loved and widely-known tunes of all time and of course much of that can be attributed to Judy Garland's performance in  "The Wizard of Oz".  The version you're hearing here includes the introductory verse that was dispensed with in the movie\, an unfortunate omission because it really sets the tone for the main verse and its absence is contrary to what Harold Arlen intended in 1939 when he composed this song that will live forever.  The interpretation of  "Over the Rainbow" on this CD has a modernized slant that was dreamed up by Emily\, her father Habib and their team of creative Chicagoans. This is just an excerpt of a song that lasts for five minutes & twenty seconds. Later in this tune she takes a scat solo that will uplift you and make any Monday tolerable.   Watch the adjoining clips on this YouTube channel and you'll understand the reason for Emily's rapid ascendance from the local to the national scene. Actually\, the INTERNATIONAL scene where she sang on the summer jazz festival circuit in Europe.  Emily made her performance debut in 1987 at age five. A year later while doing the European jazz festival circuit she crossed paths with Dizzy Gillespie who immediately noticed the nature of her gift and became a friend and mentor to both Emily and her father\, guitarist Habib Haddad. Dizzy appeared as a guest soloist at some of Emily's jazz festival concerts\, had her as guest vocalist with his big band and readily agreed to be on this CD (when she was a seasoned 8-year-old)\,    Emily had an uncanny knack for scatting through chord changes in the most pure and intuitive manner. For example\, hear Dizzy & Emily trading eights on "Bye Bye Blackbird" from her CD debut HERE:  http://youtu.be/0FNTkXBjxpM  Here's Emily in performance at the Gold Star Sardine Bar: http://youtu.be/uPGDKMloogQ   Here's the TV news coverage of her Sardine Bar appearance: http://youtu.be/zar6dd6uxK8  Here's Emily being interviewed on the Geraldo Rivera show: http://youtu.be/OFpwUfjOta0   Here she is as a 10-year-old in performance at Chicago's legendary Green Mill nightclub:  http://youtu.be/6oHLmWAzcf8  And this is a news segment on that Green Mill appearance: http://youtu.be/uUPjc_voNZo  NOTE: This YouTube channel is Chicago-based.

The lyrics of the song are narrated first person by Kate's sister\, who sings about Kate's impressive dancing skill and her wish to be able to emulate it. She laments that she's not quite "up to date"\, but believes that dancing like "Sister Kate" will rectify this\, and she will be able to impress "all the boys in the neighborhood" like her sister.    The dance of "shmmy" was named after one of the belly-dance figures and was one of many manifestations of the increasing public interest in the Orient and the Oriental culture -- evoked by many factors\, like the archeological excavations in  Egypt as well as post-WW1 technological revolution  (esp.-- the long-distance plane flightsor the cruise-liner trips) which enabled  middle class people to take part in the modern style tourist journeys across the wast and formerly unattainable territories. However\, still exists another version of the birth of that strange word: according to one artristic legend\, it was a Polish dancer from  Cracow\, Marianna Michalska -- better known as "Gilda Grey" - who\, in her early days in America  and before her show\, where she was supposed to present the new  dance hit of the year 1918  -- said to her dresser in her broken English: - Gimmie'dat'shmisee (chemise).   Whatever did Gilda Grey really say - and in whatever chemise she made her first shimmy-steps on stage -- the new dance-trot in short time conquered dance floors all over the world. It is very difficult to describe\, in short terms\, what was the choreographic clue to a shimmy- my aunt\, who  in my famile carried a deserved title of a "ballroom queen" would once present it to me when I was a kid\, and I saw nothing but series of  con vulsive jigs\, jerks and belly shakes which rather unpleasantly contrasted with what I considered as a sensuous logic of the waltz\, of tango or even -- of the charleston (which came several years later\, in 1924).   In Poland\, shimmy was made popular by the Warsaw operette diva Lucyna Messal\, who presented it at the Polish premiere of Emmerich Kalman's operette "Bayadera". in 1923. E.Kalman's hit "Każda piękność tańczy shimmy" (Ev'ry Beauty Dances Shimmy)   became one of the international evergreens and is still considered as the key shimmy-tune in the history of the lighter music in Europe. In YT are available several excellent modern renditions of that Kalman's song\, from among which the most instructive and presented in a breathtaking & hot manner is a presentation by young Hungarian dancers http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUJMBAEfo-g  Also\, very picturesque is Russian version entitled  "Ah Mademoiselle\, stan'tsueem shimmy?" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl06NffV3b0 or amusing presentation by the Italian Operette artists\, under the title "Signorina vuol ballare lo shimmy ?" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvS2ZNFGDe0   In USA\, where Kalman's operetta has never been such a hit like in Europe\, the key shimmy tune has always been the Clarence William's/Piron jazzy tune "I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate". Also\, very popular was Spencer William's tune "Shimme-Sha-Wabble" http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xiypoj_red-nichols-his-5-pennies-shim-me-sha-wabble-1930_music#.Ud8RAJH5v0Q .

The same year this tune was released and recorded at Audio Fidelity Records label in New York City.  In 1972\, Hot Butter's rerecording was a huge hit in many countries. That version is by far the most well-known of this tune. The tune was very popular in the Soviet Union and was featured in one of the Nu\, pogodi! animated series.  Original version - Background  Composer Gershon Kingsley (of Perrey and Kingsley) first recorded it for his 1969 album Music to Moog By. In 1971 the song was re-recorded by Kingsley's band First Moog Quartet. Stan Free\, member of the First Moog Quartet\, rerecorded the instrumental with his band Hot Butter in 1972.  The title refers to the short staccato or sharp "popping" sound used.  Other cover versions  It has since been covered by various artists\, including: DJ Voyager\, Anarchic System with vocal version\, a pre-fame Jean Michel Jarre (under the pseudonyms of The Popcorn Orchestra and Jamie Jefferson)\, Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops\, Unter Null\, Richard D. James AKA Aphex Twin\, M&H Band\, Muse\, DJ Fantomas\, Gigi D'Agostino\, Guru Josh\, Iranian artist Shadmehr Aghili\, Afrosound\, The Time Frequency (TTF)\, Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass\, Norrie Paramor & the Midland Radio Orchestra\, Ronnie Aldrich\, The Treble Spankers\, the Boomtang Boys\, Space Penguins\, Pattie Brooks (disco version as part of a medley that also included Black is Black & Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye)\, Bass Bumpers (fronted by the Crazy Frog cartoon)\, Liars\, Finnish band Seidat\, Swedish DJ Richi M\, the Irish DJ Showey\, South African Psytrance act Parana\, Italian pop band La Strana Società\, Japanese electronic artists Denki Groove\, Russian Virtuoso Guitar Player Victor Zinchuk\, Spanish rock band Los Pekenikes\, Shadowy Men On A Shadowy Planet and the Swedish Chef.  It has also been remixed by Hexstatic on the Pick 'n' Mix album. In 2003 Greek synthpop Duo Marsheaux released a darker mix of "Popcorn" as their debut single\, which became a radio play hit in Europe. The song was also featured as the background music in the first version of the 1982 arcade game Pengo\, the 1983 IBM PC game Digger\, and the 1984 Mikro-Gen microcomputer game Pyjamarama.  Many cover versions were made on popular home computers such as Atari\, ZX Spectrum\, Commodore 64 and Amiga\, often by anonymous artists. On the 17th of September\, 2007\, Electropop group Plemo released a free track on micromusic.net based on the original "Popcorn" melody. It includes samples from "(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)" of the Beastie Boys. In 1976\, the tenth episode of Nu\, Pogodi! includes this song as Volk (The Wolf) tries to get closer and closer to Zayats (The Hare) at a construction site.  Big band arranger James Last recorded "Popcorn" in 1972  The song has never been covered by Kraftwerk although there are mistagged copies of the song allegedly by them (most frequently the version by M&H Band) in circulation. There is also a version circulating on the internet that is claimed to have been made by avant-garde group The Residents even though it sounds vastly different from The Residents' usual experimental sound. This version is actually made by the hard house artists called The Rezidents\, hence the confusion between the two.  A variation of "Popcorn" was used by WDIV in Detroit\, Michigan as background music for the station's Michigan Lottery Lotto drawings during the 1980s.  Most recently\, alternative rock band Muse performed this song live in Teignmouth\, UK during their two nights at The Den. The song featured prominent electric guitar along with heavy percussion and bass. A studio version of their cover was released on the 2010 single "Resistance". Faith No More covered the song live in Argentina in The Second Coming Tour.  The Muppets recorded a cover of the song featuring it as the theme of a new Swedish Chef sketch\, hence its naming as Pöpcørn\, which was released in July 2010.  Other uses  The song was used in the 1982 arcade game Pengo and the next year in the PC video game Digger.	0

In 1929 he started the Wills Fiddle Boys in Ft. Worth\, then came to the attention of perennial Texas Gubernatorial candidate Pappy Lee O'Daniel who ran the Light Crust Flour Mills in Saginaw\, Texas just north of Ft. Worth.  Wills lept to fame playing as the Light Crust Doughboys but after several years the band tired of the gig as they were also expected to load flour trucks during the day.  In '34 the band moved to Tulsa to get away from Pappy Lee and formed the Texas Playboys.  They invented western music with a jazz beat known as Western Swing.  Some of his music was dead-on jazz while other songs were straight western-his genre was hard to pin down.  On clear channel 50\,000 watt KVOO in Tulsa The Playboys broadcast from Cain's Ballroom on North Main and they played it all. In 1968 Wills was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame as the King of Western Swing- and as Willie Nelson crooned-he's still the King.  Wills died in  Ft Worth\, Texas in 1975. Leon McAuliffe\, his steel guitar player featured on this record\, was born in Houston\, Texas in 1917.  He played with Bob Wills band until WWII and after the war formed his own group in Tulsa. Steel Guitar Rag was recorded in Chicago at the Furniture Mart Building\, 666 Lakeshore Drive on September 29\, 1936 on the Vocalion and Okeh subsidiary labels of Columbia.	0

Und ich stand im Rot versunken\, noch schlaftrunkend\,  und ich dachte: Wenn das alles ist  Wenn das alles ist wenn das alles ist wenn das wirklich alles ist dann lass uns leben wie's eben so geht solang es geht wenn das alles ist  Als ich zwölf war\, nahm man mich zum Zirkus;  und ich sah Tiger durch die Reifen springen\,  Menschen\, die an Seilen hingen\,  und den Mann im Clownstrikot.  Und sie klatschten wie besessen\,  doch was dachte ich indessen?  Wenn das alles ist  Wenn das alles ist wenn das alles ist wenn das wirklich alles ist dann lass uns leben wie's eben so geht solang es geht wenn das alles ist  Und fünfzehn war ich\, da traf ich Walter\,  am Fahrkartenschalter der Stadtbahnstation.  Er hielt meine Hand\, und wir liefen durch Strassen\,  unsere düsteren Strassen\, vergassen die Kälte\,  vergassen den Hunger\, und sein Mund streifte mein Haar.   Dann kam er abhanden\, er verschwand ohne Wort.  Sterben wollte ich auf der Stelle\, sterben wollte ich\, sofort.  Doch eines Morgens\, um sechs Uhr zehn\,  sah ich mich im Fensterglas meiner Stadtbahn stehen\,  und all die Verschlafenen um mich herum\,  und ich dachte\, wenn das die Liebe war\,  wenn das die Liebe ist\, wo gar nichts war\,  wo gar nichts ist\, dann hab ich nichts vermisst.  Wenn das alles ist  Wenn das alles ist wenn das alles ist wenn das wirklich alles ist dann lass uns leben  So dachte ich damals so denk ich noch immer und wende mich ab von dem was verletzt doch kommt es mal schlimmer fällt er mir nicht ein\, er lässt mich allein\, er bleibt verschwunden\, für Wochen\, für Stunden er gilt als vermisst\, mein Satz: Wenn das alles ist  Wenn das alles ist wenn das wirklich alles ist dann lass uns leben wie's eben so geht solang es geht wenn das alles ist	0

According to Velasquez\, the song was inspired by an aria from an opera by Enrique Granados\, a Spanish composer and pianist of classical music. Played by Trio Los Panchos\, whether this was the first version I'm not sure but I found this version is the best version I've ever heard so far\, particularly their outstanding guitar arrangement.  The lyric goes :  Bésame\, bésame mucho como si fuera esta noche la última vez\, bésame\, bésame mucho que tengo miedo perderte perderte después.  Quiero tenerte muy cerca mirarme en tus ojos y estar junto a ti\, piensa que tal vez mañana estaré muy lejos muy lejos de aquí\,   bésame\, bésame mucho como si fuera esta noche la última vez\, bésame\, bésame mucho que tengo miedo perderte perderte después  Enjoy !	0

COL title VAL Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat COL performer VAL Charles Perry	COL video title VAL Mildred Bailey - I Don't Stand A Ghost Of A Chance With You - 1939 COL channel name VAL warholsoup100 COL description VAL Vintage Radio Slideshow. Mildred Bailey (February 27\, 1907 -- December 12\, 1951) was a popular and influential American jazz singer during the 1930s\, known as "The Rockin' Chair Lady" and "Mrs. Swing". Her number one hits were "Please Be Kind"\, "Darn That Dream"\, "Rockin' Chair" and "Says My Heart". In the mid 1930s\, she recorded with her third husband Red Norvo. A dynamic couple\, they earned the nicknames "Mr. and Mrs. Swing". During this period (1936--1939) Norvo recorded for Brunswick (with Bailey as primary vocalist) and Bailey recorded her own set of recordings for Vocalion\, often with Norvo's band. Some of her recordings instead featured members of Count Basie's band. Despite her divorce from Norvo\, she and Red would continue to record together until 1945. Suffering from diabetes and depression (during her adult life Bailey was overweight)\, she only made a few recordings following World War II.  Mildred Bailey died December 12\, 1951\, in Poughkeepsie\, New York\, of heart failure\, aged 44\, chiefly due to her diabetes. Her ashes were scattered. Red Norvo outlived Bailey by nearly half a century\, dying in April 1999\, a week after his 91st birthday. "I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You" is a 1932 song composed by Victor Young\, with lyrics written by Ned Washington and Bing Crosby\, recorded on October 14\, 1932 by Bing Crosby in New York. In 1939\, Mildred Bailey fronted a six-side\, mostly blues session as "Mildred Bailey and her Oxford Greys" for Vocalion\, which featured a small mixed-race combo of Mary Lou Williams (piano)\, Floyd Smith (electric guitar)\, John Williams (bass) and Eddie Dougherty (drums).	0

COL title VAL Just Because COL performer VAL Rosemary Clooney	COL video title VAL Billy Vaughn -- Love Is a Many Splendored Thing COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Richard "Billy Vaughn" (el 12 de abril de 1919 - el 26 de septiembre de 1991) era un cantante\, multiinstrumentista\, y líder de orquesta. Él nació en Glasgow\, Kentucky\, donde su padre era un barbero que amó la música e inspiró a Billy y le enseñó  tocar la mandolina a la edad de 3 años cuando padecía  un caso de la sarampión. Él continuó aprendiendo varios otros instrumentos.  En 1941 Vaughn se afilió a la Guardia Nacional de los Estados Unidos para lo que había sido preparado como una cesión de un año\, pero cuando la Segunda Guerra Mundial estalló\, le enviaron al extranjero hasta el final la guerra  en 1945.  Él decidió hacer de la música su carrera cuando él fue licenciado del ejército al final de guerra\, y asistió al Colegio de Estado de Kentucky Occidental\, ahora conocido como la Universidad de Kentucky Occidental.  Mientras él estaba un estudiante allí\, otros tres compañeros\, Jimmy Sacca\, Donald McGuire\, y Seymour Spiegelman\, que habían formado un trío vocal\, el Hilltoppers\, reclutaron a Vaughn para tocar el piano con ellos. Él pronto añadió su voz \, convirtiendo el trío en un cuarteto. Como  miembro del grupo\, él también escribió su primera canción \, Tentativa\, que charted en 1952.  En 1954 dejó el grupo para afiliarse a Archivos de Punto en Gallatin\, Tennessee como el director de música. Posteriormente formó su propia orquesta\, y tuvo un gran éxito en aquel mismo año "con la Melodía del Amor." Continuó cosechando éxitos  durante la próxima década y media. Vaughn murió del cáncer en Palomar\, California el 26 de septiembre\, { El 26 de septiembre} 1991.

COL description VAL VERSE  You don't know that I felt good when we up and parted. You don't know I knocked on wood gladly broken-hearted. Worrying is trought\, I sleep all night appetite and health restored. You don't know how muck I'm bored!  REFRAIN 1  The sleepless nights\, the daily fights the qick toboggan when you reach the heights I miss the kisses and I miss the bites I wish I were in love again!  The broken dates\, the endless waits\, the lovely loving and the hateful hates\, the conversations with the flying plates I wish I were in love again!  No more pain no more strain  now I'm sane but ... I would rather be gaga! The pulled-out fur of cat and cur the fine mismating of a him and her I've learned my lesson\, but I wish I were  in love again!  REFRAIN 2 The furtive sight the blackened eye\, the words "I'll love you till the day I day" the self-deception the belives the lie I wish I were in love again!  When love congeals it soon reveals the faint aroma of performing seals the double-crossong ps a pair of heels. I wish I were in love again!  No more care no despair I'm all there now But I'd rather be punch-drunk! Belive me sir I much prefer  the classic battle of a him and her. I don't like quiet and I wish I were in love again!  http://www.stlyrics.com	0

Nathaniel Adams Coles (March 17\, 1919 -- February 15\, 1965)\, known professionally as Nat King Cole\, was an American musician who first came to prominence as a leading jazz pianist. Although an accomplished pianist\, he owes most of his popular musical fame to his soft baritone voice\, which he used to perform in big band and jazz genres. He was one of the first black Americans to host a television variety show\, and has maintained worldwide popularity since his death.  RIP "The Serene Poet of Jazz" George Shearing\, we lost you today (February 14\, 2011) on Valentines Day... you will be missed and we shall remember and celebrate your music forever.

Recorded in Capitol Studios\, Hollywood\, CA\, December 22\, 1961.  (Capitol Records)  Lost April\, Where did you go? Like winter's snow\, I saw you vanish. Lost April\, So soft and warm. A memory  Not even time can banish.  Lost April\, That taught me this. A single kiss Could lead to heaven. But April had numbered days\, So when they passed\,  Love couldn't last. I lost love and you\, And April\, too.  [Interlude]  So when they passed\, Love couldn't last.  I lost love and you\,  And April\, too.	1

COL title VAL Light My Fire COL performer VAL Negative Space	COL video title VAL Carlos Gardel - El Día Que Me Quieras (escena completa) - Audio Excelente COL channel name VAL calioff COL description VAL Alfredo Le Pera\, además de admirar la poesía del nayarita Amado Nervo\, era letrista y guionista del actor\, cantante y compositor argentino\, Carlos Gardel.   Lepera retomó la idea de la poesía de Nervo  y mediante el recurso de la paráfrasis\, realizó una nueva creación.   La letra del poema fue musicalizada por Carlos Gardel y el director de orquesta\, violinista y compositor de tangos\, el argentino Terig Tucci\, se hizo cargo de los arreglos musicales. El 19 de marzo de 1935 fue grabada en Nueva York y utilizada como tema de la película del mismo nombre\, dirigida por John Reinhardt.  El texto musicalizado quedó así:  Acaricia mi ensueño el suave murmullo de tu suspirar. ¡Como ríe la vida si tus ojos negros me quieren mirar! Y si es mío el amparo de tu risa leve que es como un cantar\, ella aquieta mi herida\, ¡todo\, todo se olvida..! El día que me quieras la rosa que engalana se vestirá de fiesta con su mejor color. Al viento las campanas dirán que ya eres mía y locas las fontanas me contarán tu amor. La noche que me quieras desde el azul del cielo\, las estrellas celosas nos mirarán pasar y un rayo misterioso hará nido en tu pelo\, luciérnaga curiosa que verá...¡que eres mi consuelo..!  En la versión cantada por Carlos Gardel\, él recita: El día que me quieras no habrá más que armonías\, será clara la aurora y alegre el manantial. Traerá quieta la brisa rumor de melodías y nos darán las fuentes su canto de cristal. El día que me quieras endulzará sus cuerdas el pájaro cantor\, florecerá la vida\, no existirá el dolor...  Para enseguida\, en la película\, continuar cantándola\, ahora a dúo con Rosita Montero:  La noche que me quieras desde el azul del cielo\, las estrellas celosas nos mirarán pasar y un rayo misterioso hará nido en tu pelo\, luciérnaga curiosa que verá... ¡que eres mi consuelo!  "El día que me quieras" poema del autor Méxicano Amado Nervo se publicó en 1922 en el libro El Arquero Divino:  El día que me quieras tendrá más luz que junio; la noche que me quieras será de plenilunio\, como notas de Bethoveen vibrando en cada rayo sus inefables cosas\, y habrá juntas más rosas que en todo el mes de mayo. Las fuentes cristalinas irán por las laderas saltando cantarinas\, el día que me quieras. El día que me quieras\, los sotos escondidos resonarán arpegios nunca jamás oídos. Éxtasis de tus ojos\, todas las primaveras que hubo y habrá en el mundo\, serán cuando me quieras. Cogidas de la mano\, cual rubias hermanitas luciendo golas cándidas\, irán las margaritas por montes y praderas delante de tus pasos\, el día que me quieras... Y si deshojas una\, te dirá su inocente postrer pétalo blanco: "¡Apasionadamente!" Al reventar el alba del día que me quieras\, tendrán todos los tréboles cuatro hojas agoreras\, y en el estanque\, nido de gérmenes ignotos\, florecerán las místicas corolas de los lotos. El día que me quieras será cada celaje ala maravillosa\, cada arrebol miraje de las Mil y Una Noches\, cada brisa un cantar\, cada árbol una lira\, cada monte un altar. El día que me quieras\, para nosotros dos cabrá en un solo beso la beatitud de "Dios".  aporte de "Carlos Tango DJ" http://carlostangodj.com & Cantando Tangos https://www.youtube.com/user/cantandotangos	0

COL title VAL Can't Buy Me Love COL performer VAL Bugs & Friends	COL video title VAL François Glorieux plays The Beatles - 03 - Can't buy me love (Gershwin/Prokofiev) COL channel name VAL François Miet COL description VAL Improvisation on "Can't buy me love" in the style of George Gershwin and Sergei Prokofiev. La plus grande originalité de cet étonnant LP réside sans doute dans le fait que chaque pièce a été entièrement improvisée. En d'autres termes : jouée spontanément sans préparation\, ni partition. Si François Glorieux est le seul pianiste de notre XXè siècle à s'être aventuré aussi loin dans le domaine de l'improvisation\, il ne révèle ici qu'UN des des multiples aspects de ce "grand art" qu'il pratique comme personne : l'improvisation de style. Et cela tient du miracle! Loin de se contenter d'un "pastiche à la manière de ..."\, il nous démontre comment les noms illustres de l'histoire de la musique auraient pu traiter les admirables mélodies des Beatles. Certains thèmes ont été reproduits intégralement\, d'autres ont été légèrement modifiés ou adaptés à l'image même du compositeur! Et on chercherait en vain un défaut de style ou de construction\, une faute de goût\, une lacune. Comme le disait si bien un critique musical allemand : " François Glorieux est en quelque sorte le faux-monnayeur de l'improvisation\, car c'est si parfait\, si réussi\, qu'on ne sait s'il joue le vrai ou le faux."	1

He is best known for the tracks\, "Because Of You" and "Pretend". He variously worked with Count Basie\, the Mills Rhythm Boys and Lucky Millinder.   "Duke" Reid  (1915 -- 1975) was a Jamaican record producer\, DJ and label owner.

In the 1960s\, Reid founded record label Treasure Isle\, named after his liquor store\, that produced ska and rocksteady music.[1] He was still active in the early 1970s\, working with toaster U-Roy. He died in early 1975 after having suffered from a severe illness for the last year.  アーサー・"デューク"・リード（Arthur "Duke" Reid、1915年 - 1975年）はジャマイカの音楽プロデューサー、DJ、レコードレーベル経営者。 1950年代後半に立ち上げた自身のサウンド・システム、トロージャン(Duke Reid's Trojan)と、1960年代に入り設立した自身のレーベル、トレジャー・アイル(Treasure Isle)はスカ、ロック・ステディを生み出し、後のレゲエをはじめとするジャマイカ音楽の発展に多大な貢献を果たした。	0

COL title VAL Set Fire to the Rain COL performer VAL Sara Niemietz	COL video title VAL A Lover's Question - Ernestine Anderson COL channel name VAL vintageblackmusic COL description VAL Nice cover version from 1961\, released on 45rpm by Mercury Records\, backed with "That's All I Want From You".  "A Lover's Question" has been recorded by many artists including Otis Redding and Del Reeves\, but was originally a hit for Clyde McPhatter in 1958 on Atlantic Records. The song was written by Brook Benton and Jimmy T. Williams and was Clyde McPhatter's most successful release\, reaching number six on the Billboard Hot 100\, and number one on the R&B chart for one week.  According to an issue of Jet magazine from February 1961\, the finger snapping you hear in Ernestine Anderson's version of the song\, was done by Brook Benton himself\, who happened to be in the studio when it was recorded.  The inimitable Ernestine Anderson is a world-class jazz singer who started her career in the late 1940s. Her debut album\, "Hot Cargo" was released by Mercury in 1956. Her best known club classic is the 1960s Bossa Nova tinged "Keep An Eye On Love".  Listen to "That's All I Want From You" here: http://youtu.be/WIv6X53v6N0	0

Nathaniel Adams Coles (March 17\, 1919 -- February 15\, 1965)\, known professionally as Nat King Cole\, was an American musician who first came to prominence as a leading jazz pianist. Although an accomplished pianist\, he owes most of his popular musical fame to his soft baritone voice\, which he used to perform in big band and jazz genres. He was one of the first black Americans to host a television variety show\, and has maintained worldwide popularity since his death.  RIP "The Serene Poet of Jazz" George Shearing\, we lost you today (February 14\, 2011) on Valentines Day... you will be missed and we shall remember and celebrate your music forever.

Far removed from the mind-expanding\, flower-power explorations of their California contemporaries\, they were a gritty\, hard-hitting band respectful of their blues\, country\, and rock & roll roots. John Fogerty's cutting\, raspy voice bore echoes of Howlin' Wolf and Little Richard as he delivered lyrics that alternately celebrated and bemoaned a working man's life. In a rare instance of art and commerce coinciding\, CCR's stream of hit singles made them one of the most successful '60s rock bands. The band broke up acrimoniously in the early '70s\, but Fogerty went on to a successful (if sporadic) solo career.	0

COL title VAL Mi sono innamorata di te COL performer VAL Ornella Vanoni	COL video title VAL 45's - Just Squeeze Me - Four Aces (Decca) COL channel name VAL Lloyd T. COL description VAL Recorded in 1952 with "Heart and Soul" on the flipside. A pair of Philadelphia boys\, Al Alberts and Dave Mahoney\, finding themselves in the North Atlantic in the Navy in WWII\, killed time by singing together. Joining two more local boys\, Rosario and Louis\, they formed the Four Aces\, following in the footsteps of the Ames Brothers. Their first hit was "(It's No) Sin\," which was shopped to no avail to New York record companies\, and finally released by Al\, who started his own record company\, Victoria Records\, to do it. The song peaked on Billboard's charts at #4 in 1951\, and the Aces were quickly signed by Decca. The group-written "Tell Me Why\," "A Garden in the Rain\," "Perfidia\," "I'm Yours" and "Heart and Soul" were next to climb high on the charts. Appearing frequently on TV\, Aces singles "La Rosita\," "Just Squeeze Me\," "Laughing on the Outside" and "The Gang that Sang (Heart of My Heart)" were among 8 of the group's hits in 1952. "Stranger in Paradise" went to #2 on the charts\, which the Aces finally topped with the theme from the movie "Three Coins in a Fountain." Popular hits "Dream" and "So Long\," followed\, and "Mr. Sandman" and "Melody of Love" scored in Billboard's top five before the floodgates of Rock 'n Roll opened in 1955\, and even that year the Aces had another chart-topper with "Love is a Many Splendored Thing."	0

COL title VAL You Are My Special Angel COL performer VAL The Four Preps	COL video title VAL Staccatos - Sloop John B COL channel name VAL keurspel (Leon Rossouw) COL description VAL The Staccatos are a South African band formed in November 1961 by Brian Le Gassick. The original line-up consisted of Brian le Gassick – lead vocals\, guitar\, John Leach – lead guitar\, Willie van der Walt – bass and Ian Miller – drums. In 1962 Leach and van der Walt were replaced by Richard Crouse – guitar\, Jimmy Routledge – bass and Billy Andrews – vocals\, harmonica (Billy later became one half of the duo the “Dream Merchants” with Billy Forrest). In 1964 the Staccatos won the Transvaal Merseyside Contest\, which included a recording contract with EMI. They supported Peter and Gordon on their tour of South Africa in 1965.  In 1966 Steve Lonsdale took over the lead vocals\, and Richard Crouse married Wanda Arletti who joined the group for a tour of Zambia. In 1967 Eddie Boyle – bass\, and Ronnie Cline – organ\, joined the group. In 1968 Billy Forrest approached the group to record “Cry to me” for the film “Katrina”. This song became their biggest hit\, reaching number 1 on the South African Top 20 in 1969 and charting for a massive 38 weeks\, earning them a double gold disc.  In 1969 John Elliot – sax\, joined the group and in 1970 Ivor Black – drums and Peter Vee – lead vocals (Steve Lonsdale left for America).  This song is off the album “Come Back Silly Girl” released in 1965. It's a cover of a Beach Boys song\, although they only released it in 1966.   On this album the line-up was: Ian Miller (drums and group leader)\, Richard Crouse (lead guitar)\, Billy Andrews (lead vocals and harmonica)\, Jimmy Ryan (bass) and Brian le Gassick (rhythm guitar).	0

It is related to a group of early 20th century blues and work songs that include "I'm Alabama Bound"\, "Another Man Done Gone"\, and "Don't Leave Me Here"\, and "Turn Your Lamp Down Low". It has become a blues and rock standard\, and has been recorded by many artists.  The original 1935 single by Joe Williams' Washboard Blues Singers can be heard on Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music\, Vol. 4 (Revenant\, 2000).  Notable cover versions  Van Morrison and Them  The band Them\, fronted by Van Morrison\, released "Baby\, Please Don't Go" as the A side of a single in late 1964. Boosted by the B side\, a ditty entitled "Gloria"\, the single became their first hit\, reaching No. 10 on the UK Singles Chart. Rhythm guitar was contributed by a then little-known Jimmy Page\, however he did not play the lead guitar on the track. It was re-released on the Deram label in 1973.  John Lee Hooker's posthumously released DVD Come See About Me includes a 1992 performance where Hooker plays "Baby\, Please Don't Go" on his guitar while sitting on a dock. He is accompanied on harmonica by Them's Van Morrison.  Amboy Dukes / Ted Nugent  Since it was The Amboy Dukes' debut single\, former Dukes guitarist Ted Nugent has covered the song in live performances throughout his career. The single is included on the 1967 album The Amboy Dukes.  AC/DC recorded a version for their 1975 Australia-only album High Voltage; it was released internationally in 1984 on their compilation EP '74 Jailbreak.  Aerosmith released a version of "Baby\, Please Don't Go" on their blues cover album\, Honkin' on Bobo in 2004.

"I only found out about him because he recently started advertising swing guitar lessons\," says Haggard. "I called him up\, and he has been over here while we've been cutting Frizzell songs. We wanted to do 'If You've Got the Money\, I've Got the Time\,' but Norman is pushing 70 now\, and he said\, 'Man\, I don't know if I can do that thing that way I used to.'

History  Initially released on Bang Records in April 1966\, "Solitary Man" was Diamond's debut single as a recording artist having already had moderate success as a songwriter for other artists. By July\, the track had become a minor hit rising to #55 on the U.S. pop singles chart. It would then be included on Diamond's first album\, The Feel of Neil Diamond\, released in August 1966.  While nominally about young romantic failure\, parts of the lyric:  Don't know that I will\, But until\, I can find me ... I'll be\, what I am — A solitary man ... Solitary man.  have been closely identified with Diamond himself\, as evinced by a 2008 profile in The Daily Telegraph: "This is the Solitary Man depicted on his first hit in 1966: the literate\, thoughtful and melodically adventurous composer of songs that cover a vast array of moods and emotions..." Indeed\, Diamond himself would tell interviewers in the 2000s\, "After four years of Freudian analysis I realised I had written 'Solitary Man' about myself."  "Solitary Man's" dynamic melody\, matched with the melancholic universality of its lyrics\, would make the song an attractive target for later interpretations.  After Diamond had renewed commercial success with Uni Records at the end of the decade\, Bang Records re-released "Solitary Man" as a single and it reached #21 on the U.S. pop charts in summer 1970.  He originally recorded two versions of the song\, as he later did with "Cherry\, Cherry." One of them had his harmonic vocal track on the Chorus of the song. The other version was him singing the song alone\, without his prerecorded harmony on the track.  On such live albums as Gold: Recorded Live at the Troubadour\, Hot August Night and some subsequent recordings\, Diamond altered the lyrics to "then you came along" from the original "then Sue came along."  In a 2005 Rolling Stone retrospective\, Dan Epstein wrote\, "'Solitary Man' remains the most brilliantly efficient song in the Diamond collection. There's not a wasted word or chord in this two-and-a-half minute anthem of heartbreak and self-affirmation\, which introduced the melancholy loner persona that he's repeatedly returned to throughout his career."  Cover versions  In 1976\, T. G. Sheppard released a cover version for Hitsville Records. It went to #14 on the country music charts (Hot Country Songs) and #100 on the Hot 100.  In 1966\, famous Italian singer Gianni Morandi recorded a cover version titled "Se perdo anche te" ("If I lose you too"). The author of the Italian lyrics was Franco Migliacci\, who was Morandi's producer at that time and who\, eight years before\, had written the lyrics to Domenico Modugno's international hit "Nel blu\, dipinto di blu (Volare)." This song was arranged by Ennio Morricone\, who at that time conducted many tunes published by the Italian RCA Victor\, and was the B-Side of "C'era un ragazzo che come me amava i Beatles e i Rolling Stones" ("There was a boy who\, like me\, loved the Beatles and the Rolling Stones")\, a song against the Vietnam War.  The Tucson\, Arizona alternative rock band The Sidewinders added a version of the song as the fifth track on their 1989 hit album Witchdoctor.  Chris Isaak covered "Solitary Man" as the last track of his 1993 album San Francisco Days. The music video for the song was directed by Larry Clark.  Johnny Cash used "Solitary Man" for the title track of his 3rd American Recordings album in 2000. The recording received a Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance. His recording of the song was used in the penultimate episode of Stargate Atlantis\, "Vegas." The recording was also used for the opening credits of the film "Solitary Man" (2010) starring Michael Douglas.  In 2004\, the Finnish band HIM covered "Solitary Man" for their first compilation album\, And Love Said No: The Greatest Hits 1997--2004. It was released as a single and a music video\, produced by Bam Margera\, was created.  The band Crooked Fingers covered it on their 5 track EP of cover songs\, the Reservoir Songs EP.  Cliff Richard recorded Solitary Man for his 1966 EP La La La La La.  Skin Flesh & Bones recorded a reggae cover of it on their 1974 7" release.  Tony Carey covered Solitary Man on his album Only the Young Die Good and on the album The Boystown Tapes.  Jussi Syren And The Groundbreakers recorded a bluegrass version on their album Heartagrass - An Acoustic Tribute To HIM\, a tribute to fellow Finnish performers HIM  Billy Joe Royal Jay and the Americans Johnny Rivers and Ólöf Arnalds.	0

The "Rubber Band"\,a group from Scandinavia (Denmark?Sweden?)\, they started in 1979\, when it was still considered blasphemous to copy The Beatles\, and their music. Despite this opinion\, that was held by most of the general public\, Rubber Band continued to rehearse with dedication\, until their first public performance as "Billerne". (They later changed their name to Rubber Band\, inspired by The Beatles LP "Rubber Soul"). "X'mas - The Beatmas" recorded this Christmas songs CD by using the arrangement of the Beatles' songs. The "Rubber Band" managed to arrange and play Christmas songs using the real "Beatles sound" and instrumentation. The casual listener will immediately think that's the real Beatles.	0

Tell me baby\, do you recognize me? Well\, it's been a year\, it doesn't surprise me. Merry Christmas\, I wrapped it up and sent it With a note saying 'I love you;' I meant it. Now I know what a fool I've been But if you kiss me now\, I know you'd fool me again.  //Last Christmas I gave you my heart But the very next day\, you gave it away This year\, to save me from tears I'll give it to someone special//  A crowded room\, friends with tired eyes I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice. My God\, I thought you were someone to rely on. Me\, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on. A face on a lover with a fire in his heart A man undercover but you tore me apart Now I've found a real love You'll never fool me again.  ///Last Christmas I gave you my heart But the very next day\, you gave it away This year\, to save me from tears I'll give it to someone special///  (In background: A face on a lover with a fire in his heart A man undercover but you tore me apart Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again)	1

COL title VAL Spartacus COL performer VAL The Afro Blues Quintet Plus One	COL video title VAL Gerry Gibbs - 2015 - Live In Studio - 04 Spartacus Love Theme COL channel name VAL JazzTube COL description VAL Personnel Kenny Barron: piano Ron Carter: acoustic bass Gerry Gibbs: drums  Composers Alex North  Drummer Gerry Gibbs has been living a recurring dream with slight variations for the past few years. In December of 2012\, he laid down tracks with two of his idols—the legendary Ron Carter and the estimable Kenny Barron—and dubbed their group the Thrasher Dream Trio. The eponymous debut from that band\, featuring fifteen tracks recorded at those sessions\, was\, not surprisingly\, a strong and classy affair filled with standards\, some originals\, and other jazz-friendly fare\, such as Stevie Wonder's "Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing" and Burt Bacharach's "Promises\, Promises."   At the time of that album's release\, those last-mentioned tracks could simply be viewed as part of the well-rounded program. But looking back now\, it actually seems like they were dropped as hints of what was to come. About a year-and-a-half after that first Thrasher Dream Trio album was recorded\, Gibbs brought the band together again to lay things down for We're Back (Whaling City Sound\, 2014)\, a jazz-does-R&B project with A-list guests—vibraphonist Warren Wolf\, saxophonist Steve Wilson\, and organist Larry Goldings. That album offered multiple helpings of Wonder and Earth\, Wind & Fire along with single servings of Bacharach\, Marvin Gaye\, Miles Davis\, and the Average White Band. As on the trio's first album\, the sparks were flying. The playing field\, however\, had changed a bit.   For this\, the third go-around for this group\, Gibbs does it again\, tweaking the formula without altering the essence of the trio. This time he turned the focus toward pop-ish material from the '50s and '60s—the work of Bacharach\, Henry Mancini\, Michel Legrand\, and others of that ilk—and put an audience in front of the band\, recording live at Systems Two Recording Studio. Guests are part of the package again—now it's trumpeter Roy Hargrove and vocalist Cassandra Wilson\, each appearing on a few tracks—and they help to add another wrinkle or two to the project without drawing focus away from the trio.   The album opens on a fluid "Wives And Lovers" that allows Barron's lyricism to shine through\, gives Carter a chance to step into the spotlight\, and puts Gibbs' brushwork at center stage. From there\, the trio moves on with an unusually upbeat take on "The Summer Knows\," a Wilson-enhanced version of "The Look Of Love" that moves from bossa nova to swing\, and a variety of other familiar hits of yesteryear. Hargrove joins in for "On A Clear Day\," quoting Ellington at one point and playfully trading solos with Gibbs; Vince Guaraldi's cheerfulness shines through on a perky trio performance of his "Cast Your Fate To The Wind"; "More" is transformed from a stale confection into an enjoyable swinger; and "Watch What Happens" happens twice—first as a cheerful\, Brazilian-based instrumental\, then as a swing-centered feature for Wilson.   Along the way there are plenty of other bright spots—an appropriately noir-ish "What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life?" with Hargrove on flugelhorn\, a leisurely stroll through "Girl Talk"—and plenty of moments that serve as simple reminders as to why Barron and Carter are loved\, respected\, and emulated the world over.

Mercy Street  Artist: VA Title Of Album: Live At The Baked Potato Vol.1 Label: Dark Matter Distribution Release Date: May 22\, 2001 Total Time: 64:16 Type: Collection (various artists)\, Live\, Instrumental Genre: Jazz\, Fusion  1. Mercy Street (Peter Gabriel) 2. Ain't Gonna Wait (Jeff Richman) 3. Monkfish (Jeff Richman) 4. Seven Stars (Ferrante\, Haslip\, Kennedy) 5. Splatch (Marcus Miller) 6. Dreamscape (Simon Phillips)  Review Guitarist Jeff Richman\, drummer Dave Weckl\, bassist Jimmy Haslip\, and a few more of their friends got together at the Baked Potato in Hollywood\, CA\, one evening in 1999 and performed an audacious jazz fusion set that resulted in Live At The Baked Potato. This release is totally raw\, purely improvised\, and is the first of a two-part series that captures the spontaneity of these great musicians\, doing what they do best -- jamming! Vinnie Colaiuta on drums\, Abraham Laboriel on bass\, Steve Tavaglione on soprano saxophone\, and Jeff Richman on guitar kick the set into high gear with an 11-minute version of Peter Gabriel's "Mercy Street." Steve Tavaglione wails the melody on soprano sax which segues into an awesome guitar solo from Richman. Laboriel walks all over the track with basslines steeped in rhythms similar to Noel Redding's spectacular playing as a member of Jimi Hendrix's band. Drummer Dave Weckl is on fire on "Splatch" with sparks of electricity flying in all directions from his drum kit but leaves its existing framework in tact. His excellent timing\, varied rhythms\, and syncopated backbeats add to the excitement of Peter Wolf's keyboards and Richman's guitar and makes this one of the more powerful songs on the CD. Live at the Baked Potato ambitiously captures these exciting musicians creating jazz fusion during the Hollywood club's most exciting era. ~ Paula Edelstein	0

Mildred Bailey (February 27\, 1907 -- December 12\, 1951) was a popular and influential American jazz singer during the 1930s\, known as "The Rockin' Chair Lady" and "Mrs. Swing". Her number one hits were "Please Be Kind"\, "Darn That Dream"\, "Rockin' Chair" and "Says My Heart". In the mid 1930s\, she recorded with her third husband Red Norvo. A dynamic couple\, they earned the nicknames "Mr. and Mrs. Swing". During this period (1936--1939) Norvo recorded for Brunswick (with Bailey as primary vocalist) and Bailey recorded her own set of recordings for Vocalion\, often with Norvo's band. Some of her recordings instead featured members of Count Basie's band. Despite her divorce from Norvo\, she and Red would continue to record together until 1945. Suffering from diabetes and depression (during her adult life Bailey was overweight)\, she only made a few recordings following World War II.  Mildred Bailey died December 12\, 1951\, in Poughkeepsie\, New York\, of heart failure\, aged 44\, chiefly due to her diabetes. Her ashes were scattered. Red Norvo outlived Bailey by nearly half a century\, dying in April 1999\, a week after his 91st birthday. "I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You" is a 1932 song composed by Victor Young\, with lyrics written by Ned Washington and Bing Crosby\, recorded on October 14\, 1932 by Bing Crosby in New York. In 1939\, Mildred Bailey fronted a six-side\, mostly blues session as "Mildred Bailey and her Oxford Greys" for Vocalion\, which featured a small mixed-race combo of Mary Lou Williams (piano)\, Floyd Smith (electric guitar)\, John Williams (bass) and Eddie Dougherty (drums).	0

Far removed from the mind-expanding\, flower-power explorations of their California contemporaries\, they were a gritty\, hard-hitting band respectful of their blues\, country\, and rock & roll roots. John Fogerty's cutting\, raspy voice bore echoes of Howlin' Wolf and Little Richard as he delivered lyrics that alternately celebrated and bemoaned a working man's life. In a rare instance of art and commerce coinciding\, CCR's stream of hit singles made them one of the most successful '60s rock bands. The band broke up acrimoniously in the early '70s\, but Fogerty went on to a successful (if sporadic) solo career.	0

COL title VAL Easy to Love COL performer VAL Artie Shaw and His Orchestra	COL video title VAL Gerry Gibbs - 2015 - Live In Studio - 04 Spartacus Love Theme COL channel name VAL JazzTube COL description VAL Personnel Kenny Barron: piano Ron Carter: acoustic bass Gerry Gibbs: drums  Composers Alex North  Drummer Gerry Gibbs has been living a recurring dream with slight variations for the past few years. In December of 2012\, he laid down tracks with two of his idols—the legendary Ron Carter and the estimable Kenny Barron—and dubbed their group the Thrasher Dream Trio. The eponymous debut from that band\, featuring fifteen tracks recorded at those sessions\, was\, not surprisingly\, a strong and classy affair filled with standards\, some originals\, and other jazz-friendly fare\, such as Stevie Wonder's "Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing" and Burt Bacharach's "Promises\, Promises."   At the time of that album's release\, those last-mentioned tracks could simply be viewed as part of the well-rounded program. But looking back now\, it actually seems like they were dropped as hints of what was to come. About a year-and-a-half after that first Thrasher Dream Trio album was recorded\, Gibbs brought the band together again to lay things down for We're Back (Whaling City Sound\, 2014)\, a jazz-does-R&B project with A-list guests—vibraphonist Warren Wolf\, saxophonist Steve Wilson\, and organist Larry Goldings. That album offered multiple helpings of Wonder and Earth\, Wind & Fire along with single servings of Bacharach\, Marvin Gaye\, Miles Davis\, and the Average White Band. As on the trio's first album\, the sparks were flying. The playing field\, however\, had changed a bit.   For this\, the third go-around for this group\, Gibbs does it again\, tweaking the formula without altering the essence of the trio. This time he turned the focus toward pop-ish material from the '50s and '60s—the work of Bacharach\, Henry Mancini\, Michel Legrand\, and others of that ilk—and put an audience in front of the band\, recording live at Systems Two Recording Studio. Guests are part of the package again—now it's trumpeter Roy Hargrove and vocalist Cassandra Wilson\, each appearing on a few tracks—and they help to add another wrinkle or two to the project without drawing focus away from the trio.   The album opens on a fluid "Wives And Lovers" that allows Barron's lyricism to shine through\, gives Carter a chance to step into the spotlight\, and puts Gibbs' brushwork at center stage. From there\, the trio moves on with an unusually upbeat take on "The Summer Knows\," a Wilson-enhanced version of "The Look Of Love" that moves from bossa nova to swing\, and a variety of other familiar hits of yesteryear. Hargrove joins in for "On A Clear Day\," quoting Ellington at one point and playfully trading solos with Gibbs; Vince Guaraldi's cheerfulness shines through on a perky trio performance of his "Cast Your Fate To The Wind"; "More" is transformed from a stale confection into an enjoyable swinger; and "Watch What Happens" happens twice—first as a cheerful\, Brazilian-based instrumental\, then as a swing-centered feature for Wilson.   Along the way there are plenty of other bright spots—an appropriately noir-ish "What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life?" with Hargrove on flugelhorn\, a leisurely stroll through "Girl Talk"—and plenty of moments that serve as simple reminders as to why Barron and Carter are loved\, respected\, and emulated the world over. Their time and taste are impeccable\, and when married to Gibbs' in-the-tradition drumming\, you know the music is going to go in the right direction every time.	0

Manilow's achievements include sales of more than 76 million records worldwide. In 1978\, five of his albums were on the best-selling charts simultaneously\, a feat equalled only by Frank Sinatra\, Michael Jackson and Johnny Mathis. He has recorded a string of Billboard hit singles and multi-platinum albums that have resulted in his being named Radio & Records number one Adult Contemporary artist and winning three straight American Music Awards for Favourite Pop/Rock Male Artist. Several well-known entertainers have given Manilow their "stamp of approval\," including Sinatra\, who was quoted in the 1970s regarding Manilow\, "He's next." In 1988\, Bob Dylan stopped Manilow at a party\, hugged him and said\, "Don't stop what you're doing\, man. We're all inspired by you." Arsenio Hall cited Manilow as a favourite guest on The Arsenio Hall Show and admonished his audience to respect him for his work.   LYRICS: I remember all my life rainin' down as cold as ice Shadows of a man a face through a window Cryin' in the night the night goes into morning. Just another day  happy people pass my way Looking in their eyes I see a memory I never realized how happy you made me. Oh Mandy well you came and you gave without taking But I sent you away oh Mandy Well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking And I need you today oh Mandy. I'm standing on the edge of time I've walked away when love was mine Caught up in a world of up-hill climbing The tears are in my mind and nothing is rhyming. Oh Mandy well you came and you gave without taking Yesterday's a dream-l face the morning Crying on a breeze the pain is calling Oh Mandy well you came and you gave without taking	0

COL title VAL Faded Love COL performer VAL Dottie West	COL video title VAL Dean Martin -- That's All I Want From You (VintageMusic.es) COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Dean Martin (de nombre real Dino Paul Crocetti) nació el 17 de julio de 1917 en la localidad de Steubenville\, Ohio (Estados Unidos). Martin se fue introduciendo poco a poco en los nightclubs como cantante\, actuando junto a la orquesta de Ernie McKay con el nombre artístico de Dino Martini. En una de sus actuaciones\, que compaginaban música y humor\, coincidió con un cómico que intentaba también abrirse camino en el mundo del espectáculo\, su nombre era Jerry Lewis. Los dos se hicieron muy amigos\, lo que les llevó a actuar como pareja en el año 1946 en el club Atlantic City\, consiguiendo con su química despertar el entusiasmo entre el público asistente. Poco después debutaron en la radio y en 1949 firmaron con los estudios Paramount para protagonizar su primera película\, "My Friend Irma" (1949)\, un título dirigido por George Marshall.  "My friend Irma" fue el inicio de una fructífera colaboración que produjo comedias como "Vaya Par De Marinos" (1951) de Hal Walker\, "Qué Par De Golfantes" (1953) de Norman Taurog\, "Viviendo Su Vida" (1954) de Taurog\, "Artistas y Modelos" (1955) de Frank Tashlin\, "Un Fresco En Apuros" (1955) de Taurog\, "Juntos Ante El Peligro" (1956)\, también dirigidos por Norman Taurog\, o "Loco Por Anita" (1956)\, película de Tashlin que contaba con la presencia de la sueca Anita Ekberg. La larga amistad terminó después del rodaje de "Loco Por Anita". La pareja rompió su exitosa colaboración artística para iniciar carreras en solitario. Mientras Jerry siguió protagonizando comedias\, Dino diversificó mucho más sus papeles\, demostrando un sorprendente talento para la interpretación dramática. Además continuó grabando discos y consiguiendo éxito con canciones clásicas como "Volare" o "Everybody Loves Somebody".   En el cine y ya sin la compañía de Lewis\, Martin destacó en títulos como "El Baile De Los Malditos" (1957) de Edward Dmytryk\, "Río Bravo" (1959)\, western de Howard Hawks\, "La Cuadrilla De Los Once" (1960) de Lewis Milestone\, "Cuatro Tíos De Texas" (1963) de Robert Aldrich\, "Bésame\, Tonto" (1964) de Billy Wilder\, o "Los Cuatro Hijos De Katie Elder" (1965) de Henry Hathaway.

Lisa Conway of Del Bel and L CON joined us for the vocal.   We're a trans-Atlantic experimental indie orchestra based in Toronto and London\, and somehow over our 15+ years we've gotten the praise of many of our musical heros including Lou Reed\, Spacemen 3's Sonic Boom\, and My Bloody Valentine's Kevin Shields.

Good Christians\, fear\, for sinners here  The silent Word is pleading.  This\, this is Christ the King\, Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:  Haste\, haste to bring Him laud\, The babe\, the son of Mary.  So bring Him incense\, gold and myrrh\,  Come Peasant\, King to own Him The King of Kings salvation brings\, Let loving hearts enthrone Him.  Nails\, spears shall pierce him through\,  the cross he bore for me\, for you.  Hail\, hail the Word made flesh\, the Babe\, the Son of Mary.

The Excelsior record label was established by Otis René in 1944\, and ceased operations in 1951. It is particularly notable for having released some of the first recordings by Nat King Cole. Otis René was noted to have earned $25\,000 on one song in 1945\, "I'm Lost"\, recorded by the King Cole Trio. René had written and produced the song\, as well distributed the record.  Otis René is best known as the co-author of the 1931 song "When It's Sleepy Time Down South"\, co-written with his brother Leon René\, and Clarence Muse. Other songs co-written by Otis René include "Someone's Rocking My Dreamboat"\, included by Murray Head on his 1975 album Say It Ain't So and "That's My Home"\, included by Tony Bennett on his 2002 album\, A Wonderful World. Prior to devoting his full-time efforts to music\, Otis René was a pharmacist in New Orleans. During the 1940s\, with his brother\,Leon René\, Otis René established and ran the independent rhythm and blues labels Exclusive Records and Excelsior Records. Otis was responsible for and publicly identified with Excelsior Records\, while his brother Leon was indentified with Exclusive Records.  In 1945\, René was elected president of the newly-established Pacific Coast Record Manufacturers' Association. In support of their record labels\, Otis René and Leon René purchased their own record plant\, but when the format changed from 78 rpm to 45rpm\, they could not press the new speed. Otis René's Excelsior label existed from 1944 to 1951. His brother Leon's Exclusive Records existed from 1944 to 1949. Artists on Otis René's label included Herb Jeffries\, Timmie Rogers and the Al Russell Trio. In 1952\, with saxophonist Preston Love\, René launched the short-lived Spin Records. The label released material by the Preston Love Orchestra\, among others.	0

When I hear that Serenade in blue I'm somewhere in another world\, alone with you Sharing all the joys we used to know Many moons ago  Once again your face comes back to me Just like the theme of some forgotten melody In the album of my memory Serenade in blue  It seems like only yesterday The small cafe\, a crowded floor And as we danced the night away I hear you say forever more And then the song became a sigh Forever more became goodbye Cause you remianed in my heart\, but  Tell me darling in there still a spark? Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew Should I go on whistling in the dark\, Serenade in blue	0

Records. The album consists of twelve cover songs and no originals. Autumn Records\, the band's previous label\, had sold the band to Warner Brothers in early 1966. Warner Brothers\, however\, did not control the publishing rights\, and opted to have the band record an album of covers\, including songs originally performed by Richard Berry\, Rolling Stones\, The Beatles and Bob Dylan\, as well as recent hit singles by such acts as The Mamas & the Papas and Simon & Garfunkel. Lead vocalist Sal Valentino explained\, "When we went to Warner Brothers\, they were just anxious to get a record out\, to capitalize on the success we had. That record was the wrong one to do at the time.  The album features Don Irving on guitar. Irving briefly became a member of the Beau Brummels filling in for Ron Elliott\, who also played on the album\, but was unable to withstand the rigors of touring due to his diabetic condition.	0

COL title VAL Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas COL performer VAL Daniela Andrade	COL video title VAL Kenny G - Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas (Arista Records 1994) COL channel name VAL ChristmasTimeTV COL description VAL "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" is a song introduced by Judy Garland in the 1944 MGM musical Meet Me in St. Louis. Frank Sinatra later recorded a version with modified lyrics\, which has become more common than the original. The song was written by Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane.  When presented with the original draft lyric\, Garland\, her co-star Tom Drake and director Vincente Minnelli criticized the song as depressing\, and asked Martin to change the lyrics. Though he initially resisted\, Martin made several changes to make the song more upbeat. For example\, the lines "It may be your last / Next year we may all be living in the past" became "Let your heart be light / Next year all our troubles will be out of sight". Garland's version of the song\, which was also released as a single by Decca Records\, became popular among United States troops serving in World War II; her performance at the Hollywood Canteen brought many soldiers to tears.  In 1957\, Frank Sinatra asked Martin to revise the line "Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow". He told Martin\, "The name of my album is A Jolly Christmas. Do you think you could jolly up that line for me?" Martin's new line was "Hang a shining star upon the highest bough". Martin made several other alterations\, changing the song's focus to a celebration of present happiness\, rather than anticipation of a better future. On The Judy Garland Show Christmas Special\, Judy sings the song to her children Joey and Lorna Luft with Sinatra's alternate lyrics.  Have yourself a merry little Christmas  Let your heart be light  From now on  our troubles will be out of sight  Have yourself a merry little Christmas  Make the Yule-tide gay  From now on  our troubles will be miles away   Here were are as in olden days  happy golden days of yore  Faithful friends who are dear to us  gather near to us once more   Through the years we all will be together  If the Fates allow  Hang a shining star upon the highest bough  And have yourself a merry little Christmas now	1
COL title VAL Big Spender COL performer VAL Jaimee Paul	COL video title VAL Bessie Smith -- Baby Won't You Please Come Home 1923 COL channel name VAL Henri Erwig COL description VAL Bessie Smith -- Baby Won't You Please Come Home 1923  Bessie Smith (1892 or 1894 --1937) was the most popular and successful female American blues singer of the 1920s and 1930s\, and a strong influence on subsequent generations\, including Billie Holiday\, Mahalia Jackson\, Dinah Washington\, Nina Simone and Janis Joplin. This is one of her first recordings in 1923 with pianist Clarence Williams. In no other way than living the kind of violent\, hard-drinking street life she sang about\, could Bessie Smith have inspired in her audiences the powerful empathy that ultimately won her the title\, "Empress of the Blues." Throughout her career\, Bessie was respected for being a strong\, independent African-American woman with tremendous talent and determination. She expressed great pride in her culture\, and gladly participated in its earthy pleasures\, regularly indulging her taste for alcohol and sex to extremes. How ever much others tried to run roughshod over her\, Bessie refused to submit to the slightest abuse without a knock-down\, drag-out fight. With few exceptions\, she held to her musical ideals with equal tenacity. Though musically illiterate\, she regularly collaborated with her pianists to compose and write down her music and her words frequently touched on pertinent events in her life. Her performance style\, too\, derives considerably from her own personal and cultural attributes. (first posted on ilbofilms feb 24 2008; 492 views)	0

COL title VAL Wild Mountain Thyme COL performer VAL The Real McKenzies	COL video title VAL Gerry Gibbs - 2015 - Live In Studio - 04 Spartacus Love Theme COL channel name VAL JazzTube COL description VAL Personnel Kenny Barron: piano Ron Carter: acoustic bass Gerry Gibbs: drums  Composers Alex North  Drummer Gerry Gibbs has been living a recurring dream with slight variations for the past few years. In December of 2012\, he laid down tracks with two of his idols—the legendary Ron Carter and the estimable Kenny Barron—and dubbed their group the Thrasher Dream Trio. The eponymous debut from that band\, featuring fifteen tracks recorded at those sessions\, was\, not surprisingly\, a strong and classy affair filled with standards\, some originals\, and other jazz-friendly fare\, such as Stevie Wonder's "Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing" and Burt Bacharach's "Promises\, Promises."   At the time of that album's release\, those last-mentioned tracks could simply be viewed as part of the well-rounded program. But looking back now\, it actually seems like they were dropped as hints of what was to come. About a year-and-a-half after that first Thrasher Dream Trio album was recorded\, Gibbs brought the band together again to lay things down for We're Back (Whaling City Sound\, 2014)\, a jazz-does-R&B project with A-list guests—vibraphonist Warren Wolf\, saxophonist Steve Wilson\, and organist Larry Goldings. That album offered multiple helpings of Wonder and Earth\, Wind & Fire along with single servings of Bacharach\, Marvin Gaye\, Miles Davis\, and the Average White Band. As on the trio's first album\, the sparks were flying. The playing field\, however\, had changed a bit.   For this\, the third go-around for this group\, Gibbs does it again\, tweaking the formula without altering the essence of the trio. This time he turned the focus toward pop-ish material from the '50s and '60s—the work of Bacharach\, Henry Mancini\, Michel Legrand\, and others of that ilk—and put an audience in front of the band\, recording live at Systems Two Recording Studio. Guests are part of the package again—now it's trumpeter Roy Hargrove and vocalist Cassandra Wilson\, each appearing on a few tracks—and they help to add another wrinkle or two to the project without drawing focus away from the trio.   The album opens on a fluid "Wives And Lovers" that allows Barron's lyricism to shine through\, gives Carter a chance to step into the spotlight\, and puts Gibbs' brushwork at center stage. From there\, the trio moves on with an unusually upbeat take on "The Summer Knows\," a Wilson-enhanced version of "The Look Of Love" that moves from bossa nova to swing\, and a variety of other familiar hits of yesteryear. Hargrove joins in for "On A Clear Day\," quoting Ellington at one point and playfully trading solos with Gibbs; Vince Guaraldi's cheerfulness shines through on a perky trio performance of his "Cast Your Fate To The Wind"; "More" is transformed from a stale confection into an enjoyable swinger; and "Watch What Happens" happens twice—first as a cheerful\, Brazilian-based instrumental\, then as a swing-centered feature for Wilson.   Along the way there are plenty of other bright spots—an appropriately noir-ish "What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life?" with Hargrove on flugelhorn\, a leisurely stroll through "Girl Talk"—and plenty of moments that serve as simple reminders as to why Barron and Carter are loved\, respected\, and emulated the world over. Their time and taste are impeccable\, and when married to Gibbs' in-the-tradition drumming\, you know the music is going to go in the right direction every time.	0

The "Rubber Band"\,a group from Scandinavia (Denmark?Sweden?)\, they started in 1979\, when it was still considered blasphemous to copy The Beatles\, and their music. Despite this opinion\, that was held by most of the general public\, Rubber Band continued to rehearse with dedication\, until their first public performance as "Billerne". (They later changed their name to Rubber Band\, inspired by The Beatles LP "Rubber Soul"). "X'mas - The Beatmas" recorded this Christmas songs CD by using the arrangement of the Beatles' songs. The "Rubber Band" managed to arrange and play Christmas songs using the real "Beatles sound" and instrumentation. The casual listener will immediately think that's the real Beatles.	0

The song became even more popular worldwide once it was chosen to be the theme of Top Secret\, a 1960s TV series. Even the Skatalites and Alberto Cortez did their own version of the song. Eddy Helder known by the stage name Ping Pong or Ping Ping is a singer born in 1923 in Suriname\, at the time Dutch Guyana. He is known for being the first to interpret the Sucu sucu song in 1960\, composed by Tarateño Rojas. (From Wikipedia)	0

COL title VAL John Henry COL performer VAL Jerry Reed	COL video title VAL Theme from 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (MGM Album) - Sung by Debbie Gravitte COL channel name VAL Debbie Gravitte COL description VAL MP3 ► http://DebbieTunes.com ► http://facebook.com/DebbieGravitte   Info ►http://DebbieGravitte.com  Theme from 2001: A Space Odyssey.  Sung by Debbie Gravitte. That's correct\, SUNG by Debbie!  You can download this song from her album "The MGM Album"\, which includes songs from all the great MGM films of the past.  Music plays a crucial part in 2001\, and not only because of the relatively sparse dialogue. From very early on in production\, Kubrick decided that he wanted the film to be a primarily non-verbal experience\,one that did not rely on the traditional techniques of narrative cinema\, and in which music would play a vital role in evoking particular moods. About half the music in the film appears either before the first line of dialogue or after the final line. Almost no music is heard during any scenes with dialogue.  The film is remarkable for its innovative use of classical music taken from existing commercial recordings. Most feature films then and now are typically accompanied by elaborate film scores or songs written especially for them by professional composers. In the early stages of production\, Kubrick had actually commissioned a score for 2001 from noted Hollywood composer Alex North\, who had written the score for Spartacus and also worked on Dr. Strangelove.  However\, during post-production\, Kubrick chose to abandon North's music in favor of the now-familiar classical music pieces he had earlier chose as "guide pieces" for the soundtrack. North did not know of the abandonment of the score until after he saw the film's premiere screening.  The initial MGM soundtrack album release contained none of the material from the altered and uncredited rendition of "Aventures"\, used a different recording of "Also Sprach Zarathustra" than that heard in the film\, and a longer excerpt of "Lux Aeterna" than that in the film.

Ingresaron al Salón de la Fama del Rock en 2008 y han vendido cerca de 100 millones de discos a nivel mundial. Han sido reconocidos frecuentemente por otros guitarristas y músicos como una influencia. Además\, por su estilo\, forma de interpretar las guitarras\, principalmente\, han influido en muchos grupos de rock y de surf. Sukiyaki es una hermosa melodía que me trae muchos recuerdos de mi adolescencia\, cuando nuestro hermano mayor\, José María (El Charro)\, poseía más de 200 LP's y también más de 200 discos 45 RPP\, por supuesto que en esa abundante y variada colección no faltaba ese LP de The Ventures (el mismo que se muestra en la primera imagen del video)\, y donde estaba la canción Sukiyaki. Todos escuchábamos esos discos en un pequeño tocadiscos\, también propiedad de él. Luego\, cuando adquirió un equipo de sonido\, la melodía era más extraordinaria por su condición de aparato de sonido Stereo. Como ya es costumbre\, el video consta de imágenes de Lima. Se incluyen modelos japonesas\, y la comida de ese país oriental.  Un afectuoso saludo a todas/todos  Raúl L.C. - patricioraul69@gmail.com	0

Ingresaron al Salón de la Fama del Rock en 2008 y han vendido cerca de 100 millones de discos a nivel mundial. Han sido reconocidos frecuentemente por otros guitarristas y músicos como una influencia. Además\, por su estilo\, forma de interpretar las guitarras\, principalmente\, han influido en muchos grupos de rock y de surf. Sukiyaki es una hermosa melodía que me trae muchos recuerdos de mi adolescencia\, cuando nuestro hermano mayor\, José María (El Charro)\, poseía más de 200 LP's y también más de 200 discos 45 RPP\, por supuesto que en esa abundante y variada colección no faltaba ese LP de The Ventures (el mismo que se muestra en la primera imagen del video)\, y donde estaba la canción Sukiyaki. Todos escuchábamos esos discos en un pequeño tocadiscos\, también propiedad de él. Luego\, cuando adquirió un equipo de sonido\, la melodía era más extraordinaria por su condición de aparato de sonido Stereo. Como ya es costumbre\, el video consta de imágenes de Lima. Se incluyen modelos japonesas\, y la comida de ese país oriental.  Un afectuoso saludo a todas/todos  Raúl L.C. - patricioraul69@gmail.com	0

COL title VAL Stack O'Lee COL performer VAL Doc & Merle Watson	COL video title VAL 45's - Just Squeeze Me - Four Aces (Decca) COL channel name VAL Lloyd T. COL description VAL Recorded in 1952 with "Heart and Soul" on the flipside. A pair of Philadelphia boys\, Al Alberts and Dave Mahoney\, finding themselves in the North Atlantic in the Navy in WWII\, killed time by singing together. Joining two more local boys\, Rosario and Louis\, they formed the Four Aces\, following in the footsteps of the Ames Brothers. Their first hit was "(It's No) Sin\," which was shopped to no avail to New York record companies\, and finally released by Al\, who started his own record company\, Victoria Records\, to do it. The song peaked on Billboard's charts at #4 in 1951\, and the Aces were quickly signed by Decca. The group-written "Tell Me Why\," "A Garden in the Rain\," "Perfidia\," "I'm Yours" and "Heart and Soul" were next to climb high on the charts. Appearing frequently on TV\, Aces singles "La Rosita\," "Just Squeeze Me\," "Laughing on the Outside" and "The Gang that Sang (Heart of My Heart)" were among 8 of the group's hits in 1952. "Stranger in Paradise" went to #2 on the charts\, which the Aces finally topped with the theme from the movie "Three Coins in a Fountain." Popular hits "Dream" and "So Long\," followed\, and "Mr. Sandman" and "Melody of Love" scored in Billboard's top five before the floodgates of Rock 'n Roll opened in 1955\, and even that year the Aces had another chart-topper with "Love is a Many Splendored Thing."	0

COL title VAL Christmas Time Is Here COL performer VAL Denis Solee with the Jeff Steinberg Orchestra	COL video title VAL Vince Guaraldi Trio - Christmas Time Is Here (Instrumental) COL channel name VAL VinceGuaraldiVEVO COL description VAL On December 9\, 1965\, A Charlie Brown Christmas aired on TV screens across America and instantly captured the hearts and ears of a generation. Bolstering the animated special\, based on Charles M. Schulz’s immensely popular PEANUTS comic strip\, was an engaging score from Bay Area jazz artist Vince Guaraldi\, who brought characters like Charlie Brown\, Lucy\, and Snoopy to life through his evocative cues.   Working primarily with bassist Fred Marshall and drummer Jerry Granelli\, Guaraldi paired inspired interpretations of traditional holiday fare (“O Tannenbaum\,” “Hark\, the Herald Angels Sing\,” and “What Child Is This”) with original compositions\, including the instantly recognizable “Linus and Lucy” theme\, “Skating\,” and “Christmas Time Is Here.” The latter song\, available as both an instrumental and vocal track\, featured young choral singers from St. Paul’s Episcopal Church in San Rafael\, CA.    More than five decades later\, the Emmy® and Peabody®-winning animated classic has spawned more than two dozen subsequent PEANUTS specials. Guaraldi’s soundtrack\, meanwhile\, has since become one of the best-selling jazz albums in history\, second only to Miles Davis’ Kind of Blue\, and regularly ranks among America’s top-selling holiday albums every December.

And if we're the victims of the night\, I won't be blinded by light.  Just call me angel of the morning ANGEL Just touch my cheek before you leave me\, baby.

COL title VAL The Beat Goes On COL performer VAL Britney Spears	COL video title VAL Kenny Burrell - Jimmy Smith - Easy Living COL channel name VAL rapitroy COL description VAL Personnel: Kenny Burrell (guitar); Jimmy Smith (organ); George Duvivier\, Milt Hinton (bass); Bill English\, Mel Lewis (drums).  Producer: Creed Taylor.  Reissue producer: Ben Young.  Recorded at the Van Gelder Studio\, Englewood Cliffs\, New Jersey on July 16\, 1963; Bell Sound Studios\, New York\, New York on July 25\, 1963; A&R Recording\, New York\, New York on July 29\, 1963. Includes liner notes by Michael Ullman and Del Shields.  Digitally remastered using 24-bit technology by Kevin Reeves (Polygram Studios).  This is part of the Verve Master Edition series.  This auspicious recording started out almost as an afterthought. Jimmy Smith was in the midst of making his excellent big-band album ANY NUMBER CAN WIN when he stepped into a couple of New York studios with old pal Kenny Burrell and a rhythm section to quickly cut the sides that became BLUE BASH. The air of spontaneity is certainly present here\, as Burrell and Smith use the common language of the blues to move through a varied program.  An appropriately simmering version of the Peggy Lee hit "Fever" finds Smith at his most sensual. The upbeat\, Burrell-penned "Travelin'" has something of a gospel jubilee feel\, along the lines of "When the Saints Go Marching In\," and Burrell's joyous lines makes the most of the celebratory mood. The standard "Easy Living" finds the fiery Smith in an uncommonly wistful mode\, contributing blissful\, pretty organ runs over Burrell's lush harmonies. The revealing bonus tracks\, almost another album's worth of material\, shed further light on the interaction between the musicians\, revealing both endearing flubs and previously unheard gems.	0

COL title VAL Don't Smoke in Bed COL performer VAL Carly Simon	COL video title VAL Donna Loren sings "Call Me" on Hollywood-A-Go-Go (1965) COL channel name VAL Donna Loren COL description VAL More Info: http://www.DonnaLoren.com -  Donna Loren performs the Tony Hatch penned "Call Me" on the Los Angeles-based teen variety show "Hollywood-A-Go-Go" hosted by L.A. DJ Sam Riddle on 12-25-65. Arranged by none other than Jack Nitzsche and produced by saxophonist extraordinaire Steve Douglas. Tony Hatch wrote many of Petula Clark's hits including "Downtown". This record introduced a new\, softer vocal style for Donna\, which was released by Capitol Records in 1965. Donna also performed this song live on The Milton Berle Show in a legitimate stage style in 1966 when she was a regular on the show. You will find that performance on YouTube if you go to my channel. "Call Me" was originally a hit for Petula Clark (UK) and Chris Montez (US).   Donna Loren was the one-and-only "Dr Pepper Girl" from 1963 to 1968. She was signed to a long-term contract with the soft-drink company to sing all television and radio commercials\, do all magazine and billboard advertising representing them in every capacity\, sometimes sharing the spotlight with American Bandstand's Dick Clark. This relationship led to her touring in Dick Clark's Caravan of Stars with other popular acts like Diana Ross and The Supremes and singing solos in the popular Beach Party films starring Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon. Later\, she became the regular female vocalist on the popular 60's American live rock n roll TV show "Shindig" and she appeared in singing and acting roles in many iconic TV shows like Batman\, The Monkees\, Gomer Pyle\, The Mothers-In-Law\, Red Skelton\, Milton Berle and various game shows. She's released 22 singles\, an album and 2 CD's. Ms Loren is currently in the studio again making music: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ-wN37G2rs  Current Videos: Donna Loren Now channel.

Mercy Street  Artist: VA Title Of Album: Live At The Baked Potato Vol.1 Label: Dark Matter Distribution Release Date: May 22\, 2001 Total Time: 64:16 Type: Collection (various artists)\, Live\, Instrumental Genre: Jazz\, Fusion  1. Mercy Street (Peter Gabriel) 2. Ain't Gonna Wait (Jeff Richman) 3. Monkfish (Jeff Richman) 4. Seven Stars (Ferrante\, Haslip\, Kennedy) 5. Splatch (Marcus Miller) 6. Dreamscape (Simon Phillips)  Review Guitarist Jeff Richman\, drummer Dave Weckl\, bassist Jimmy Haslip\, and a few more of their friends got together at the Baked Potato in Hollywood\, CA\, one evening in 1999 and performed an audacious jazz fusion set that resulted in Live At The Baked Potato. This release is totally raw\, purely improvised\, and is the first of a two-part series that captures the spontaneity of these great musicians\, doing what they do best -- jamming! Vinnie Colaiuta on drums\, Abraham Laboriel on bass\, Steve Tavaglione on soprano saxophone\, and Jeff Richman on guitar kick the set into high gear with an 11-minute version of Peter Gabriel's "Mercy Street." Steve Tavaglione wails the melody on soprano sax which segues into an awesome guitar solo from Richman. Laboriel walks all over the track with basslines steeped in rhythms similar to Noel Redding's spectacular playing as a member of Jimi Hendrix's band. Drummer Dave Weckl is on fire on "Splatch" with sparks of electricity flying in all directions from his drum kit but leaves its existing framework in tact. His excellent timing\, varied rhythms\, and syncopated backbeats add to the excitement of Peter Wolf's keyboards and Richman's guitar and makes this one of the more powerful songs on the CD. Live at the Baked Potato ambitiously captures these exciting musicians creating jazz fusion during the Hollywood club's most exciting era. ~ Paula Edelstein	0

COL title VAL Blue Skies COL performer VAL Denise Jannah	COL video title VAL Kay Starr -- You're Driving Me Crazy (What Did I Do?) COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Kay Star\, Su verdadero nombre es Katherine Laverne Starks y nació en Dougherty (Oklahoma) el 21 de julio de 1922   Joe Venuti\, la contrató para un show de música "hillbilly" y estuvo de gira con su banda por Menphis. De allí pasó a la orquesta de Bob Crosby\, el hermano de Bing Crosby\, con trabajos de una sola noche en distintas salas de baile. Tuvo la fortuna de que el show estaba patrocinado por la "Camel Caravan" y trasmitido por radio una vez al mes a toda América para que su voz fuese conocida y alcanzara enorme popularidad. Glenn Miller\, el famoso director de orquesta\, la contrató eventualmente en sustitución de su vocalista habitual\, la rubia\, Marion Hutton\, enferma y cansada tras incesantes y continuadas giras con la orquesta.  Con la orquesta de Miller\, realizo Kay Starr\, sus primeras grabaciones oficiales: "Baby Me" y "Love With a Capitol You" recogidas en el sello Bluebird en 1939. Después de terminados sus estudios escolares vuelve con Venuti antes de incorporarse a la formación de Charlie Barnet\, con quien volvió a entrar en los estudios de grabación en 1944 para grabar para los sellos "DECCA" y "V-Disc". Al año siguiente se decide a emprender su carrera en solitario formando parte de los "Capitol International Jazzmen"\, una especie de All Stars constituidos por Bill Coleman\, Buster Bailey\, Benny Carter\, Coleman Hawkins\, Nat King Cole\, Oscar Moore\, John Kirby y Max Roach. Su vivacidad en el escenario y su canto\, alegre y desenfadado recordaba algunas veces a Ella Fitzgerald y en absoluto desentonó en compañía de tan ilustres músicos. Tras la II Guerra Mundial\, Los Ángeles era un hervidero musical y números sellos fueron tras sus pasos para que grabara en distintos espacios y formatos musicales.  En 1947\, Dave Dexter\, la incorporó a Capitol hecho que marca el principio de su carrera de éxitos. Sus temas más populares fueron "Wheel Of Fortune" y "Rock And Roll Waltz". Sin embargo\, hubo que esperar hasta su segunda vuelta a este sello en 1959\, para que Kay Starr abordase un repertorio a su altura en contextos de índole jazzsiticos. Sus álbumes "Movin" (Capitol\, 1959); "Movin' On Broadway" y "The Jazz Singer" ambos para Capitol en 1960\, y los tres con la orquesta de Van Alexander\, o el selecto disco "I Cry by Night"\, que cierra el ciclo Capitol en 1961\, y grabado en pequeña formación con Ben Webster y Lee Young\, entre otros instrumentistas\, son su testamento musical.  Estos éxitos jazzisticos tardíos\, la reconciliaban absolutamente con sus seguidores y la confirmaban como una cantante admirable aunque desgraciadamente demasiada cicatera con el jazz. Kay Starr\, siguió mas o menos activa hasta finales de los años ochenta donde ya se retiró.

XAVIER CUGAT Cugat's family emigrated to Cuba when he was five. He trained as a classical violinist and played with the Orchestra of the Teatro Nacional in Havana. Cugat moved to New York somewhere between 1915 and 1918\, where he had his first brush with success during the tango craze with a band called "The Gigolos." When the craze ended\, the band folded\, and he picked up odd jobs as a violinist. Eventually\, he went to work for the Los Angeles Times as a cartoonist (Cugat's caricatures would later be syndicated by King Features). In the late 1920s\, as sound began to be used in movies\, he assembled another tango band that had some success in very early musical shorts. By the early 1930s\, he began appearing with some incarnation of his group in feature films with such memorable titles as "In Gay Madrid."  Cugat took his band to New York to open the new Waldorf Astoria Hotel and it became the hotel's resident group. His success was as much due to his showmanship (he dressed the band in flaming red jackets and kept up a lively patter in between a steady flow of novelty numbers mixed with dance tunes. Cugat never had any regrets about his artistic compromises: "I would rather play Chiquita Banana and have my swimming pool than play Bach and starve."  He worked the LA-New York circuit regularly for most of the next 30 years\, alternating hotel and radio dates with movie appearances. In 1940\, he recorded the song "Perfidia" with singer Miguelito Valdes and had a huge hit. Cugat had few Top 10 hits\, but he was never one to miss a trend\, quickly turning out records to share in the success of the conga craze\, the mambo craze\, the cha-cha craze\, the twist craze--you name it.  Cugat's later work is among his most interesting and listenable. His Mercury albums of the early 1960s feature some audacious stereo arrangements. "Cugie's Cocktails" is a must for your next lounge party\, with all its cuts oriented about the cocktail theme ("Manhattan\," "Cuba Libre\," "Creme de Menthe\," as well as several terrific originals). Switching to Decca in the mid-1960s\, he put out a series of albums that fall somewhere between discotheque and Latin soul and include some excellent numbers Cugat probably had more to do with the infusion of Latin music into the popular American scene than any other musician--Desi Arnaz and Perez Prado definitely followed in Cugat's footsteps.  FASCINATING RHYTHM "Fascinating Rhythm" is a popular song written by George Gershwin in 1924 with lyrics by Ira Gershwin. A large number of recorded versions exist.  One of the rarest recordings is one by Joe Bari (a pseudonym of Anthony Dominick Benedetto\, later better known as Tony Bennett) for Leslie Records in 1949 and issued as catalog number 919 with "Vieni Qui" as the flip side.  MHO Well\, yes indeed : guys like Xavier Cugat went along with the hypes and crazes of their times and tried not to miss "the money train" but one has to admit that\, what they did\, was top of the bill professionally speaking.  Here's a great example where "Cugie" turns the classic Gershwin song of 1924 into a "hip" twist dance version.  And he 'gets away with it" !  The arrangement is brilliant and doesn't leave anything to be desired.  We tried our best with regard to the editing of this one but one should be aware that this recording was made in 1959. Nevertheless : some spectacular listening is guaranteed here and\, why not re-discover that sixties dance craze : the twist :-) ? Whatever you decide to do : enjoy !	1

Etta Jones was an American jazz singer whose critical success and relative commercial obscurity earned her a reputation in her lifetime as a "jazz musician's jazz singer". A highly underrated singer who rarely received the recognition she richly deserved\, perhaps the salient mark of her obscurity was the number of times even followers of the female jazz vocal scene would confuse her with a more popular singer\, Etta James. Etta Jones is noted for her elegant interpretations of standards\, ballads\, and blues. Her characteristic inflections have sometimes prompted comparisons to stylistic devices employed by Billie Holiday and Dinah Washington.  Etta's accompanied by Frank Wess\, (flute\, tenor saxophone)\, Richard Wyands\, (piano)\, Skeeter Best (guitar)\,  George Duvivier (bass) and Roy Haynes (drums).  Recorded June 21\, 1960. (Prestige Records)  Build your dreams to the stars above But when you need someone true to love Don't go to strangers\, darling\, come on to me  Play with fire 'til your fingers burn And when there's no place for you to turn Don't go to strangers\, darling\, come on to me  For\, when you hear a call to follow your heart You follow your heart\, I know I've been through it all and I'm an old hand And I'll understand if you go  So make your mark for your friends to see But when you need more than company Don't go to strangers\, come on to me  Oh\, make your mark for your friends to see But when you need more than company Don't go to strangers\, darling\, come on to me	1

Join our Youtube: https://goo.gl/8AOGaN Join our Facebook: http://goo.gl/5oL723  Buy on Google Play: goo.gl/nt2FtY  Nina Simone (born Eunice Kathleen Waymon; February 21\, 1933 – April 21\, 2003) was an American singer\, songwriter\, pianist\, arranger\, and civil rights activist who worked in a broad range of musical styles including classical\, jazz\, blues\, folk\, R&B\, gospel\, and pop. Born in North Carolina\, the sixth child of a preacher\, Simone aspired to be a concert pianist. With the help of the few supporters in her hometown of Tryon\, North Carolina\, she enrolled in the Juilliard School of Music in New York. Waymon then applied for a scholarship to study at the prestigious Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia\, where she was denied despite a well-received audition. Simone became fully convinced this rejection had been entirely due to her race\, a statement that has been a matter of controversy. Years later\, two days before her death\, the Curtis Institute of Music bestowed an honorary degree on Simone. To make a living\, Eunice Waymon changed her name to "Nina Simone". The change related to her need to disguise herself from family members\, having chosen to play "the devil's music" or "cocktail piano" at a nightclub in Atlantic City. She was told in the nightclub that she would have to sing to her own accompaniment\, and this effectively launched her career as a jazz vocalist. Simone recorded more than forty albums\, mostly between 1958\, when she made her debut with Little Girl Blue\, and 1974\, and had a hit in the United States in 1958 with "I Loves You\, Porgy". Simone's musical style fused gospel and pop with classical music\, in particular Johann Sebastian Bach\, and accompanied expressive\, jazz-like singing in her contralto voice. To fund her private lessons\, Simone performed at the Midtown Bar & Grill on Pacific Avenue in Atlantic City\, whose owner insisted that she sing as well as play the piano\, which increased her weekly income to $90 a week. In 1954\, she adopted the stage name "Nina Simone". "Nina" (from niña\, meaning "little girl" in Spanish)\, and "Simone" was taken from the French actress Simone Signoret\, whom she had seen in the movie Casque d'Or. Knowing her mother would not approve of playing the "Devil's Music"\, she used her new stage name to remain undetected. Simone's mixture of jazz\, blues\, and classical music in her performances at the bar earned her a small but loyal fan base. In 1958\, she befriended and married Don Ross\, a beatnik who worked as a fairground barker\, but quickly regretted their marriage. Playing in small clubs in the same year\, she recorded George Gershwin's "I Loves You\, Porgy" (from Porgy and Bess)\, which she learned from a Billie Holiday album and performed as a favor to a friend. It became her only Billboard top 20 success in the United States\, and her debut album Little Girl Blue soon followed on Bethlehem Records. Simone lost more than $1 million in royalties (notably for the 1980s re-release of My Baby Just Cares for Me) and never benefited financially from the album's sales because she had sold her rights outright for $3\,000. After the success of Little Girl Blue\, Simone signed a contract with Colpix Records and recorded a multitude of studio and live albums. Colpix relinquished all creative control to her\, including the choice of material that would be recorded\, in exchange for her signing the contract with them. After the release of her live album Nina Simone at Town Hall\, Simone became a favorite performer in Greenwich Village. By this time\, Simone performed pop music only to make money to continue her classical music studies and was indifferent about having a recording contract. She kept this attitude toward the record industry for most of her career. Simone married a New York police detective\, Andrew Stroud\, in 1961. He later became her manager and the father of her daughter Lisa\, but he abused Simone psychologically and physically. FROM WIKIPEDIA: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina_Simone	0

COL title VAL Mean Woman Blues COL performer VAL The Spencer Davis Group	COL video title VAL Gerry Gibbs - 2015 - Live In Studio - 04 Spartacus Love Theme COL channel name VAL JazzTube COL description VAL Personnel Kenny Barron: piano Ron Carter: acoustic bass Gerry Gibbs: drums  Composers Alex North  Drummer Gerry Gibbs has been living a recurring dream with slight variations for the past few years. In December of 2012\, he laid down tracks with two of his idols—the legendary Ron Carter and the estimable Kenny Barron—and dubbed their group the Thrasher Dream Trio. The eponymous debut from that band\, featuring fifteen tracks recorded at those sessions\, was\, not surprisingly\, a strong and classy affair filled with standards\, some originals\, and other jazz-friendly fare\, such as Stevie Wonder's "Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing" and Burt Bacharach's "Promises\, Promises."   At the time of that album's release\, those last-mentioned tracks could simply be viewed as part of the well-rounded program. But looking back now\, it actually seems like they were dropped as hints of what was to come. About a year-and-a-half after that first Thrasher Dream Trio album was recorded\, Gibbs brought the band together again to lay things down for We're Back (Whaling City Sound\, 2014)\, a jazz-does-R&B project with A-list guests—vibraphonist Warren Wolf\, saxophonist Steve Wilson\, and organist Larry Goldings. That album offered multiple helpings of Wonder and Earth\, Wind & Fire along with single servings of Bacharach\, Marvin Gaye\, Miles Davis\, and the Average White Band. As on the trio's first album\, the sparks were flying. The playing field\, however\, had changed a bit.   For this\, the third go-around for this group\, Gibbs does it again\, tweaking the formula without altering the essence of the trio. This time he turned the focus toward pop-ish material from the '50s and '60s—the work of Bacharach\, Henry Mancini\, Michel Legrand\, and others of that ilk—and put an audience in front of the band\, recording live at Systems Two Recording Studio. Guests are part of the package again—now it's trumpeter Roy Hargrove and vocalist Cassandra Wilson\, each appearing on a few tracks—and they help to add another wrinkle or two to the project without drawing focus away from the trio.   The album opens on a fluid "Wives And Lovers" that allows Barron's lyricism to shine through\, gives Carter a chance to step into the spotlight\, and puts Gibbs' brushwork at center stage. From there\, the trio moves on with an unusually upbeat take on "The Summer Knows\," a Wilson-enhanced version of "The Look Of Love" that moves from bossa nova to swing\, and a variety of other familiar hits of yesteryear. Hargrove joins in for "On A Clear Day\," quoting Ellington at one point and playfully trading solos with Gibbs; Vince Guaraldi's cheerfulness shines through on a perky trio performance of his "Cast Your Fate To The Wind"; "More" is transformed from a stale confection into an enjoyable swinger; and "Watch What Happens" happens twice—first as a cheerful\, Brazilian-based instrumental\, then as a swing-centered feature for Wilson.   Along the way there are plenty of other bright spots—an appropriately noir-ish "What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life?" with Hargrove on flugelhorn\, a leisurely stroll through "Girl Talk"—and plenty of moments that serve as simple reminders as to why Barron and Carter are loved\, respected\, and emulated the world over. Their time and taste are impeccable\, and when married to Gibbs' in-the-tradition drumming\, you know the music is going to go in the right direction every time.	0

Frank Sinatra later recorded a version with modified lyrics\, which has become more common than the original. The song was written by Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane.  When presented with the original draft lyric\, Garland\, her co-star Tom Drake and director Vincente Minnelli criticized the song as depressing\, and asked Martin to change the lyrics. Though he initially resisted\, Martin made several changes to make the song more upbeat. For example\, the lines "It may be your last / Next year we may all be living in the past" became "Let your heart be light / Next year all our troubles will be out of sight". Garland's version of the song\, which was also released as a single by Decca Records\, became popular among United States troops serving in World War II; her performance at the Hollywood Canteen brought many soldiers to tears.  In 1957\, Frank Sinatra asked Martin to revise the line "Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow". He told Martin\, "The name of my album is A Jolly Christmas. Do you think you could jolly up that line for me?" Martin's new line was "Hang a shining star upon the highest bough". Martin made several other alterations\, changing the song's focus to a celebration of present happiness\, rather than anticipation of a better future. On The Judy Garland Show Christmas Special\, Judy sings the song to her children Joey and Lorna Luft with Sinatra's alternate lyrics.  Have yourself a merry little Christmas  Let your heart be light  From now on  our troubles will be out of sight  Have yourself a merry little Christmas  Make the Yule-tide gay  From now on  our troubles will be miles away   Here were are as in olden days  happy golden days of yore  Faithful friends who are dear to us  gather near to us once more   Through the years we all will be together  If the Fates allow  Hang a shining star upon the highest bough  And have yourself a merry little Christmas now	0

COL title VAL Hybrid Moments COL performer VAL Me for Rent	COL video title VAL Kay Starr -- You're Driving Me Crazy (What Did I Do?) COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Kay Star\, Su verdadero nombre es Katherine Laverne Starks y nació en Dougherty (Oklahoma) el 21 de julio de 1922   Joe Venuti\, la contrató para un show de música "hillbilly" y estuvo de gira con su banda por Menphis. De allí pasó a la orquesta de Bob Crosby\, el hermano de Bing Crosby\, con trabajos de una sola noche en distintas salas de baile. Tuvo la fortuna de que el show estaba patrocinado por la "Camel Caravan" y trasmitido por radio una vez al mes a toda América para que su voz fuese conocida y alcanzara enorme popularidad. Glenn Miller\, el famoso director de orquesta\, la contrató eventualmente en sustitución de su vocalista habitual\, la rubia\, Marion Hutton\, enferma y cansada tras incesantes y continuadas giras con la orquesta.  Con la orquesta de Miller\, realizo Kay Starr\, sus primeras grabaciones oficiales: "Baby Me" y "Love With a Capitol You" recogidas en el sello Bluebird en 1939. Después de terminados sus estudios escolares vuelve con Venuti antes de incorporarse a la formación de Charlie Barnet\, con quien volvió a entrar en los estudios de grabación en 1944 para grabar para los sellos "DECCA" y "V-Disc". Al año siguiente se decide a emprender su carrera en solitario formando parte de los "Capitol International Jazzmen"\, una especie de All Stars constituidos por Bill Coleman\, Buster Bailey\, Benny Carter\, Coleman Hawkins\, Nat King Cole\, Oscar Moore\, John Kirby y Max Roach. Su vivacidad en el escenario y su canto\, alegre y desenfadado recordaba algunas veces a Ella Fitzgerald y en absoluto desentonó en compañía de tan ilustres músicos. Tras la II Guerra Mundial\, Los Ángeles era un hervidero musical y números sellos fueron tras sus pasos para que grabara en distintos espacios y formatos musicales.  En 1947\, Dave Dexter\, la incorporó a Capitol hecho que marca el principio de su carrera de éxitos. Sus temas más populares fueron "Wheel Of Fortune" y "Rock And Roll Waltz". Sin embargo\, hubo que esperar hasta su segunda vuelta a este sello en 1959\, para que Kay Starr abordase un repertorio a su altura en contextos de índole jazzsiticos. Sus álbumes "Movin" (Capitol\, 1959); "Movin' On Broadway" y "The Jazz Singer" ambos para Capitol en 1960\, y los tres con la orquesta de Van Alexander\, o el selecto disco "I Cry by Night"\, que cierra el ciclo Capitol en 1961\, y grabado en pequeña formación con Ben Webster y Lee Young\, entre otros instrumentistas\, son su testamento musical.  Estos éxitos jazzisticos tardíos\, la reconciliaban absolutamente con sus seguidores y la confirmaban como una cantante admirable aunque desgraciadamente demasiada cicatera con el jazz. Kay Starr\, siguió mas o menos activa hasta finales de los años ochenta donde ya se retiró.

COL title VAL Wenn das Alles ist COL performer VAL Hildegard Knef	COL video title VAL Roaring 20s: Leona Williams & Her Dixie Band - I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate\,     1922 COL channel name VAL 240252 COL description VAL I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate -- Leona Williams & Her Dixie Band\, Columbia 1922 (USA; accoustical recording)  NOTE: "I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate"; often simply "Sister Kate"\, is a jazz dance song\, written by Clarence Williams and Armand Piron\, and published in 1919.  The lyrics of the song are narrated first person by Kate's sister\, who sings about Kate's impressive dancing skill and her wish to be able to emulate it. She laments that she's not quite "up to date"\, but believes that dancing like "Sister Kate" will rectify this\, and she will be able to impress "all the boys in the neighborhood" like her sister.    The dance of "shmmy" was named after one of the belly-dance figures and was one of many manifestations of the increasing public interest in the Orient and the Oriental culture -- evoked by many factors\, like the archeological excavations in  Egypt as well as post-WW1 technological revolution  (esp.-- the long-distance plane flightsor the cruise-liner trips) which enabled  middle class people to take part in the modern style tourist journeys across the wast and formerly unattainable territories. However\, still exists another version of the birth of that strange word: according to one artristic legend\, it was a Polish dancer from  Cracow\, Marianna Michalska -- better known as "Gilda Grey" - who\, in her early days in America  and before her show\, where she was supposed to present the new  dance hit of the year 1918  -- said to her dresser in her broken English: - Gimmie'dat'shmisee (chemise).   Whatever did Gilda Grey really say - and in whatever chemise she made her first shimmy-steps on stage -- the new dance-trot in short time conquered dance floors all over the world. It is very difficult to describe\, in short terms\, what was the choreographic clue to a shimmy- my aunt\, who  in my famile carried a deserved title of a "ballroom queen" would once present it to me when I was a kid\, and I saw nothing but series of  con vulsive jigs\, jerks and belly shakes which rather unpleasantly contrasted with what I considered as a sensuous logic of the waltz\, of tango or even -- of the charleston (which came several years later\, in 1924).   In Poland\, shimmy was made popular by the Warsaw operette diva Lucyna Messal\, who presented it at the Polish premiere of Emmerich Kalman's operette "Bayadera". in 1923. E.Kalman's hit "Każda piękność tańczy shimmy" (Ev'ry Beauty Dances Shimmy)   became one of the international evergreens and is still considered as the key shimmy-tune in the history of the lighter music in Europe. In YT are available several excellent modern renditions of that Kalman's song\, from among which the most instructive and presented in a breathtaking & hot manner is a presentation by young Hungarian dancers http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUJMBAEfo-g  Also\, very picturesque is Russian version entitled  "Ah Mademoiselle\, stan'tsueem shimmy?" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl06NffV3b0 or amusing presentation by the Italian Operette artists\, under the title "Signorina vuol ballare lo shimmy ?" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvS2ZNFGDe0   In USA\, where Kalman's operetta has never been such a hit like in Europe\, the key shimmy tune has always been the Clarence William's/Piron jazzy tune "I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate". Also\, very popular was Spencer William's tune "Shimme-Sha-Wabble" http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xiypoj_red-nichols-his-5-pennies-shim-me-sha-wabble-1930_music#.Ud8RAJH5v0Q .

"After You've Gone" was recorded on their first session for the label and there seems to have been some growing pains. The balance is not as good as on the other labels\, with especially weak recording of the bass.  The opening chorus is by Grappelli this time around and he is immediately followed by the Louis Armstrong-inspired singing of Freddie Taylor. It seems that everyone is holding back in these opening choruses\, and sure enough\, as soon as Taylor is finished\, the intensity goes up as Django goes into a finger-busting chorus filled with fast arpeggios and runs\, and concluding with a chorded intro to Grappelli. The violinist takes charge\, building the intensity with every chorus. The breaks\, built into the tune at the end of each 16-bar section\, seem to have little effect on Taylor\, but each time Reinhardt and Grappelli hit them\, they add to the growing excitement of the recording.   1936 May 4 - Gramophone\, Paris	0

The Excelsior record label was established by Otis René in 1944\, and ceased operations in 1951. It is particularly notable for having released some of the first recordings by Nat King Cole. Otis René was noted to have earned $25\,000 on one song in 1945\, "I'm Lost"\, recorded by the King Cole Trio. René had written and produced the song\, as well distributed the record.  Otis René is best known as the co-author of the 1931 song "When It's Sleepy Time Down South"\, co-written with his brother Leon René\, and Clarence Muse. Other songs co-written by Otis René include "Someone's Rocking My Dreamboat"\, included by Murray Head on his 1975 album Say It Ain't So and "That's My Home"\, included by Tony Bennett on his 2002 album\, A Wonderful World. Prior to devoting his full-time efforts to music\, Otis René was a pharmacist in New Orleans. During the 1940s\, with his brother\,Leon René\, Otis René established and ran the independent rhythm and blues labels Exclusive Records and Excelsior Records. Otis was responsible for and publicly identified with Excelsior Records\, while his brother Leon was indentified with Exclusive Records.  In 1945\, René was elected president of the newly-established Pacific Coast Record Manufacturers' Association. In support of their record labels\, Otis René and Leon René purchased their own record plant\, but when the format changed from 78 rpm to 45rpm\, they could not press the new speed. Otis René's Excelsior label existed from 1944 to 1951. His brother Leon's Exclusive Records existed from 1944 to 1949. Artists on Otis René's label included Herb Jeffries\, Timmie Rogers and the Al Russell Trio. In 1952\, with saxophonist Preston Love\, René launched the short-lived Spin Records. The label released material by the Preston Love Orchestra\, among others.	0

COL title VAL Joshua Fought the Battle of Jericho COL performer VAL The Swingle Singers	COL video title VAL Nat Kendrick and The Swans - (Do The) Mashed Potatoes COL channel name VAL John1948NineD COL description VAL "(Do the) Mashed Potatoes" is a rhythm and blues instrumental. It was recorded by James Brown with his band in 1959 and released as a two-part single in 1960. For contractual reasons the recording was credited to "Nat Kendrick and the Swans."  The recording of "(Do the) Mashed Potatoes" arose out of James Brown's success in using the Mashed Potato dance as part of his stage show. Brown wanted to record a Mashed Potatoes-themed instrumental with his band in order to capitalize on the dance's popularity. However\, King Records head Syd Nathan\, a frequent critic of Brown's proposals\, would not allow it. (The first instrumental recorded by Brown and his band\, titled "Doodle Bug" and credited to Brown's tenor saxophonist J.C. Davis\, had not sold well when it was released on King's sister label Federal Records.) Brown approached Henry Stone\, a friend in the music business who ran the Dade Records label\, about recording the piece with him. Stone\, although nervous about crossing Nathan (with whom he did business)\, arranged for Brown to record at his Miami studio.  "(Do the) Mashed Potatoes" was recorded with Brown playing the piano and shouting the song's title. To prevent Brown's voice from being recognized\, Stone overdubbed shouted vocals by Carlton "King" Coleman\, a local radio DJ\, onto the recording\, though Brown's voice remains audible in the background. Leadership of the band was officially credited to Nat Kendrick\, who was Brown's drummer at the time\, while the writing was credited to "Dessie Rozier"\, a pseudonym for Brown. A simple twelve bar blues tune\, "(Do the) Mashed Potatoes" became a Top Ten R&B hit in 1960 and fed what would eventually grow into a national dance craze. The band recorded several more singles under the Nat Kendrick & the Swans name\, including "Dish Rag"\, "Slow Down"\, and "Wobble Wobble"\, but none were successful. Eventually made aware of Brown's outside success\, Syd Nathan relented and allowed him to release future instrumentals on King\, starting with the 1961 single "Hold It" b/w "The Scratch".  James Brown had a second Mashed Potatoes-themed hit with "Mashed Potatoes U.S.A." in 1962.  Personnel: "Nat Kendrick & The Swans": Carlton "King" Coleman - lead vocal Alfred Corley - alto saxophone J.C. Davis - tenor saxophone James Brown - piano\, vocal yelps Bobby Roach - guitar Bernard Odum - bass Nat Kendrick - drums  SOURCE: Wikipedia  PLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels\, Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

COL title VAL I Will Survive COL performer VAL Sister Kat	COL video title VAL Donna Loren sings "Call Me" on Hollywood-A-Go-Go (1965) COL channel name VAL Donna Loren COL description VAL More Info: http://www.DonnaLoren.com -  Donna Loren performs the Tony Hatch penned "Call Me" on the Los Angeles-based teen variety show "Hollywood-A-Go-Go" hosted by L.A. DJ Sam Riddle on 12-25-65. Arranged by none other than Jack Nitzsche and produced by saxophonist extraordinaire Steve Douglas. Tony Hatch wrote many of Petula Clark's hits including "Downtown". This record introduced a new\, softer vocal style for Donna\, which was released by Capitol Records in 1965. Donna also performed this song live on The Milton Berle Show in a legitimate stage style in 1966 when she was a regular on the show. You will find that performance on YouTube if you go to my channel. "Call Me" was originally a hit for Petula Clark (UK) and Chris Montez (US).   Donna Loren was the one-and-only "Dr Pepper Girl" from 1963 to 1968. She was signed to a long-term contract with the soft-drink company to sing all television and radio commercials\, do all magazine and billboard advertising representing them in every capacity\, sometimes sharing the spotlight with American Bandstand's Dick Clark. This relationship led to her touring in Dick Clark's Caravan of Stars with other popular acts like Diana Ross and The Supremes and singing solos in the popular Beach Party films starring Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon. Later\, she became the regular female vocalist on the popular 60's American live rock n roll TV show "Shindig" and she appeared in singing and acting roles in many iconic TV shows like Batman\, The Monkees\, Gomer Pyle\, The Mothers-In-Law\, Red Skelton\, Milton Berle and various game shows. She's released 22 singles\, an album and 2 CD's. Ms Loren is currently in the studio again making music: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ-wN37G2rs  Current Videos: Donna Loren Now channel.

Blackberry winter only lasts a few days\, Just long enough to get you feeling sad When you think of all the love that you wasted On someone whom you never really had.  I'll never get over losing you But I've had to learn that life goes on And the memories grow dim like a half forgotten song 'Til the blackberry winter reminds me you are gone.  And I get so lonely\, most of all in springtime I wish I could enjoy the first of May But I know it means that blackberry winter Is not too far away.	0

COL title VAL The Band Played On COL performer VAL The Jesters	COL video title VAL Red Rubber Ball Neil Diamond COL channel name VAL 4evermore12 COL description VAL This song was written by Paul Simon & Bruce Woodley but Simon & Garfunkel never recorded it. It was released in 1966 by The Cyrkle and I think it went to #2 on the charts. It was the second track on The Feel Of Neil. I would like to thank sunshinetunes67 for helping me find this mp3. If you have never been to sunshinetunes67's channel I highly recommend it. You will hear some old songs you cant hear anywhere else. He has an amazing collection of some familiar and some never heard. It was fun for me making this video; I was trying a little animation which requires a lot of images to do. I look at it and think it might be a little hokey but when I see that ball come through the hoop it makes me smile. I sometime like to morph my images one into the next and sometimes I am lazy and use a program that makes the movie for me I just put the images in and choose the style.	0

COL title VAL Blue Moon of Kentucky COL performer VAL Patsy Cline	COL video title VAL Billy Vaughn -- Love Is a Many Splendored Thing COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Richard "Billy Vaughn" (el 12 de abril de 1919 - el 26 de septiembre de 1991) era un cantante\, multiinstrumentista\, y líder de orquesta. Él nació en Glasgow\, Kentucky\, donde su padre era un barbero que amó la música e inspiró a Billy y le enseñó  tocar la mandolina a la edad de 3 años cuando padecía  un caso de la sarampión. Él continuó aprendiendo varios otros instrumentos.  En 1941 Vaughn se afilió a la Guardia Nacional de los Estados Unidos para lo que había sido preparado como una cesión de un año\, pero cuando la Segunda Guerra Mundial estalló\, le enviaron al extranjero hasta el final la guerra  en 1945.  Él decidió hacer de la música su carrera cuando él fue licenciado del ejército al final de guerra\, y asistió al Colegio de Estado de Kentucky Occidental\, ahora conocido como la Universidad de Kentucky Occidental.  Mientras él estaba un estudiante allí\, otros tres compañeros\, Jimmy Sacca\, Donald McGuire\, y Seymour Spiegelman\, que habían formado un trío vocal\, el Hilltoppers\, reclutaron a Vaughn para tocar el piano con ellos. Él pronto añadió su voz \, convirtiendo el trío en un cuarteto. Como  miembro del grupo\, él también escribió su primera canción \, Tentativa\, que charted en 1952.  En 1954 dejó el grupo para afiliarse a Archivos de Punto en Gallatin\, Tennessee como el director de música. Posteriormente formó su propia orquesta\, y tuvo un gran éxito en aquel mismo año "con la Melodía del Amor." Continuó cosechando éxitos  durante la próxima década y media. Vaughn murió del cáncer en Palomar\, California el 26 de septiembre\, { El 26 de septiembre} 1991.

COL title VAL Blue Hawaii COL performer VAL Richard Hayman and His Orchestra	COL video title VAL Bob Wills - Steel Guitar Rag 1936 COL channel name VAL preservationhall01 COL description VAL Bob Wills was born in Kosse\, Texas in 1905.   In 1929 he started the Wills Fiddle Boys in Ft. Worth\, then came to the attention of perennial Texas Gubernatorial candidate Pappy Lee O'Daniel who ran the Light Crust Flour Mills in Saginaw\, Texas just north of Ft. Worth.  Wills lept to fame playing as the Light Crust Doughboys but after several years the band tired of the gig as they were also expected to load flour trucks during the day.  In '34 the band moved to Tulsa to get away from Pappy Lee and formed the Texas Playboys.  They invented western music with a jazz beat known as Western Swing.  Some of his music was dead-on jazz while other songs were straight western-his genre was hard to pin down.  On clear channel 50\,000 watt KVOO in Tulsa The Playboys broadcast from Cain's Ballroom on North Main and they played it all. In 1968 Wills was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame as the King of Western Swing- and as Willie Nelson crooned-he's still the King.  Wills died in  Ft Worth\, Texas in 1975. Leon McAuliffe\, his steel guitar player featured on this record\, was born in Houston\, Texas in 1917.  He played with Bob Wills band until WWII and after the war formed his own group in Tulsa. Steel Guitar Rag was recorded in Chicago at the Furniture Mart Building\, 666 Lakeshore Drive on September 29\, 1936 on the Vocalion and Okeh subsidiary labels of Columbia.	0

Mildred Bailey (February 27\, 1907 -- December 12\, 1951) was a popular and influential American jazz singer during the 1930s\, known as "The Rockin' Chair Lady" and "Mrs. Swing". Her number one hits were "Please Be Kind"\, "Darn That Dream"\, "Rockin' Chair" and "Says My Heart". In the mid 1930s\, she recorded with her third husband Red Norvo. A dynamic couple\, they earned the nicknames "Mr. and Mrs. Swing". During this period (1936--1939) Norvo recorded for Brunswick (with Bailey as primary vocalist) and Bailey recorded her own set of recordings for Vocalion\, often with Norvo's band. Some of her recordings instead featured members of Count Basie's band. Despite her divorce from Norvo\, she and Red would continue to record together until 1945. Suffering from diabetes and depression (during her adult life Bailey was overweight)\, she only made a few recordings following World War II.  Mildred Bailey died December 12\, 1951\, in Poughkeepsie\, New York\, of heart failure\, aged 44\, chiefly due to her diabetes. Her ashes were scattered. Red Norvo outlived Bailey by nearly half a century\, dying in April 1999\, a week after his 91st birthday. "I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You" is a 1932 song composed by Victor Young\, with lyrics written by Ned Washington and Bing Crosby\, recorded on October 14\, 1932 by Bing Crosby in New York. In 1939\, Mildred Bailey fronted a six-side\, mostly blues session as "Mildred Bailey and her Oxford Greys" for Vocalion\, which featured a small mixed-race combo of Mary Lou Williams (piano)\, Floyd Smith (electric guitar)\, John Williams (bass) and Eddie Dougherty (drums).	0

Poseedor de una voz de barítono\, fue durante los años cuarenta una figura carismática de la música popular negra\, al liderar una de las primeras big band de bop y convertirse en el primer cantante negro de baladas románticas (fue llamado el Sinatra negro). Con el paso de los años\, su influencia ha sido considerable en el ámbito del soul y el rhythm and blues.  Eckstine comenzó a cantar a los nueve años y participó en numerosos espectáculos para aficionados. Aunque su vocación había sido la de jugador de fútbol americano\, una grave lesión lo recondujo hacia el mundo de la música. Tras diversos trabajos al oeste de Chicago a finales de los años treinta\, Eckstine fue invitado por Earl Hines para unirse a su Grand Terrace Orchestra en 1939.  Aunque sus primeros éxitos fueron canciones triviales como "Jelly\, Jelly" y "The Jitney Man"\, grabó también varios estándares como "Stormy Monday". Hacia 1943\, se acompañaba de estrellas como Dizzy Gillespie\, Charlie Parker y Sarah Vaughan. Tras formar su propia banda ese año\, contrató a los tres y gradualmente se hizo con más figuras modernas y con futuras estrellas: Wardell Gray\, Dexter Gordon\, Miles Davis\, Kenny Dorham\, Fats Navarro y Art Blakey\, así como con arreglistas como Tadd Dameron y Gil Fuller. La Billy Eckstine Orchestra fue la primera big band bop\, y su líder reflejaba las innovaciones bop adaptando sus armonías vocales a las baladas normales. A pesar del matiz moderno del grupo\, Eckstine encabezó las listas frecuentemente a mediados de los cuarenta\, con temas como "A Cottage for Sale" y "Prisoner of Love". En las giras por Europa y América\, el cantante tocaba también la trompeta\, el trombón de válvulas y la guitarra.  Forzado a disolver la orquesta en 1947 tras haber formado la suya propia Gillespie\, Eckstine realizó una transición hacia un estilo más baladístico y con arreglos de cuerda. Grabó más de una docena de éxitos a finales de los cuarenta\, entre lo que se incluyen "My Foolish Heart" y "I Apologize". Se hizo popular en Gran Bretaña\, obteniendo un gran éxito durante los cincuenta con temas como "No One But You" y "Gigi"\, así como con sus dúos con Sarah Vaughan. Eckstine regresaría a sus raíces jazzísticas ocasionalmente\, grabando con Vaughan\, Count Basie y Quincy Jones\, y grabando un LP en directo\, No Cover\, No Minimum\, en el que interpretaba algunos solos de trompeta. Grabó varios discos para Mercury y Roulette a comienzos de los sesenta y publicó en Motown algunos discos de estándares a mediados de esa década. Tras grabar muy espaciadamente en los setenta\, Eckstine hizo su última grabación (Billy Eckstine Sings with Benny Carter) en 1986. Murió por un ataque al corazón en 1993.

COL title VAL Closer COL performer VAL Walk Off the Earth	COL video title VAL Ella Fitzgerald - If I Were a Bell COL channel name VAL Alissa Lovera COL description VAL Talk about a rara avis -- for four decades\, Ella Sings Broadway has been the most obscure and hard to find of Ella Fitzgerald's classic Verve albums. Those who did invest the time and money in unearthing it were amply rewarded: The set is a perfect complement to Fitzgerald's classic series of Song Book albums. Unlike the Song Books\, however\, Ella Sings Broadway concentrates not on the time-honored history of The Great White Way and its stellar songwriters\, but on songs and shows by writers that were part of Broadway's recent past: Rodgers and Hammerstein (South Pacific\, Me and Juliet) Adler and Ross (Damn Yankees\, The Pajama Game)\, Frank Loesser (Guys and Dolls)\, and Lerner and Loewe (Brigadoon\, My Fair Lady).  This overlooked gem of an album was arranged and conducted by Marty Paich\, the man responsible for such other Fitzgerald triumphs as Ella Swings Brightly and Whisper Not -- which places Ella Sings Broadway in most excellent company.  www.vervemusicgroup.com	0

COL title VAL Blackbird COL performer VAL Eve St. Jones	COL video title VAL The Flames - Try a little tenderness COL channel name VAL keurspel (Leon Rossouw) COL description VAL The Flames was a musical group from Durban in South Africa. The band was originally formed in 1963 by guitarist Steve Fataar\, bassist Brother Fataar (real name Edries Fataar)\, drummer George Faber and guitarist Eugene Champion. However\, this line-up would only be together to record a couple of songs. Ricky Fataar replaced George Faber as the band's drummer around 1964 and Edries Fredericks replaced Eugene Champion as the guitarist. Baby Duval briefly replaced Edries Fredericks in 1967. Blondie Chaplin then replaced Baby Duval in 1967. This was to be the line-up from 1967 until their demise as a group in 1970. In 1972 Ricky Fataar and Blondie Chaplin joined The Beach Boys.  This song is off the album "Soulfire!!" released in 1968. It was written by Jimmy Campbell\, Reg Connelly and Harry M. Woods\, and recorded initially on December 8\, 1932 by the Ray Noble Orchestra (with vocals by Val Rosing)\, followed by both Ruth Etting and Bing Crosby in 1933. In South Africa the rendition by Percy Sledge is probably the best known version.	0

COL title VAL Keepin' Out of Mischief Now COL performer VAL Sammy Price	COL video title VAL Theme from 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (MGM Album) - Sung by Debbie Gravitte COL channel name VAL Debbie Gravitte COL description VAL MP3 ► http://DebbieTunes.com ► http://facebook.com/DebbieGravitte   Info ►http://DebbieGravitte.com  Theme from 2001: A Space Odyssey.  Sung by Debbie Gravitte. That's correct\, SUNG by Debbie!  You can download this song from her album "The MGM Album"\, which includes songs from all the great MGM films of the past.  Music plays a crucial part in 2001\, and not only because of the relatively sparse dialogue. From very early on in production\, Kubrick decided that he wanted the film to be a primarily non-verbal experience\,one that did not rely on the traditional techniques of narrative cinema\, and in which music would play a vital role in evoking particular moods. About half the music in the film appears either before the first line of dialogue or after the final line. Almost no music is heard during any scenes with dialogue.  The film is remarkable for its innovative use of classical music taken from existing commercial recordings. Most feature films then and now are typically accompanied by elaborate film scores or songs written especially for them by professional composers. In the early stages of production\, Kubrick had actually commissioned a score for 2001 from noted Hollywood composer Alex North\, who had written the score for Spartacus and also worked on Dr. Strangelove.  However\, during post-production\, Kubrick chose to abandon North's music in favor of the now-familiar classical music pieces he had earlier chose as "guide pieces" for the soundtrack. North did not know of the abandonment of the score until after he saw the film's premiere screening.  The initial MGM soundtrack album release contained none of the material from the altered and uncredited rendition of "Aventures"\, used a different recording of "Also Sprach Zarathustra" than that heard in the film\, and a longer excerpt of "Lux Aeterna" than that in the film.

COL title VAL If Ever I Would Leave You COL performer VAL Thomas Hampson	COL video title VAL Billy Eckstine -- If Ever I Would Leave You COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Billy Eckstine (Pittsburgh\, 8 de julio de 1914 - Pittsburgh\, 8 de marzo de 1993) fue un cantante estadounidense de jazz y música pop. Poseedor de una voz de barítono\, fue durante los años cuarenta una figura carismática de la música popular negra\, al liderar una de las primeras big band de bop y convertirse en el primer cantante negro de baladas románticas (fue llamado el Sinatra negro). Con el paso de los años\, su influencia ha sido considerable en el ámbito del soul y el rhythm and blues.  Eckstine comenzó a cantar a los nueve años y participó en numerosos espectáculos para aficionados. Aunque su vocación había sido la de jugador de fútbol americano\, una grave lesión lo recondujo hacia el mundo de la música. Tras diversos trabajos al oeste de Chicago a finales de los años treinta\, Eckstine fue invitado por Earl Hines para unirse a su Grand Terrace Orchestra en 1939.  Aunque sus primeros éxitos fueron canciones triviales como "Jelly\, Jelly" y "The Jitney Man"\, grabó también varios estándares como "Stormy Monday". Hacia 1943\, se acompañaba de estrellas como Dizzy Gillespie\, Charlie Parker y Sarah Vaughan. Tras formar su propia banda ese año\, contrató a los tres y gradualmente se hizo con más figuras modernas y con futuras estrellas: Wardell Gray\, Dexter Gordon\, Miles Davis\, Kenny Dorham\, Fats Navarro y Art Blakey\, así como con arreglistas como Tadd Dameron y Gil Fuller. La Billy Eckstine Orchestra fue la primera big band bop\, y su líder reflejaba las innovaciones bop adaptando sus armonías vocales a las baladas normales. A pesar del matiz moderno del grupo\, Eckstine encabezó las listas frecuentemente a mediados de los cuarenta\, con temas como "A Cottage for Sale" y "Prisoner of Love". En las giras por Europa y América\, el cantante tocaba también la trompeta\, el trombón de válvulas y la guitarra.  Forzado a disolver la orquesta en 1947 tras haber formado la suya propia Gillespie\, Eckstine realizó una transición hacia un estilo más baladístico y con arreglos de cuerda. Grabó más de una docena de éxitos a finales de los cuarenta\, entre lo que se incluyen "My Foolish Heart" y "I Apologize". Se hizo popular en Gran Bretaña\, obteniendo un gran éxito durante los cincuenta con temas como "No One But You" y "Gigi"\, así como con sus dúos con Sarah Vaughan. Eckstine regresaría a sus raíces jazzísticas ocasionalmente\, grabando con Vaughan\, Count Basie y Quincy Jones\, y grabando un LP en directo\, No Cover\, No Minimum\, en el que interpretaba algunos solos de trompeta. Grabó varios discos para Mercury y Roulette a comienzos de los sesenta y publicó en Motown algunos discos de estándares a mediados de esa década. Tras grabar muy espaciadamente en los setenta\, Eckstine hizo su última grabación (Billy Eckstine Sings with Benny Carter) en 1986. Murió por un ataque al corazón en 1993.

COL title VAL The Little Drummer Boy COL performer VAL Larry Carlton	COL video title VAL Vince Guaraldi Trio - Christmas Time Is Here (Instrumental) COL channel name VAL VinceGuaraldiVEVO COL description VAL On December 9\, 1965\, A Charlie Brown Christmas aired on TV screens across America and instantly captured the hearts and ears of a generation. Bolstering the animated special\, based on Charles M. Schulz’s immensely popular PEANUTS comic strip\, was an engaging score from Bay Area jazz artist Vince Guaraldi\, who brought characters like Charlie Brown\, Lucy\, and Snoopy to life through his evocative cues.   Working primarily with bassist Fred Marshall and drummer Jerry Granelli\, Guaraldi paired inspired interpretations of traditional holiday fare (“O Tannenbaum\,” “Hark\, the Herald Angels Sing\,” and “What Child Is This”) with original compositions\, including the instantly recognizable “Linus and Lucy” theme\, “Skating\,” and “Christmas Time Is Here.” The latter song\, available as both an instrumental and vocal track\, featured young choral singers from St. Paul’s Episcopal Church in San Rafael\, CA.    More than five decades later\, the Emmy® and Peabody®-winning animated classic has spawned more than two dozen subsequent PEANUTS specials. Guaraldi’s soundtrack\, meanwhile\, has since become one of the best-selling jazz albums in history\, second only to Miles Davis’ Kind of Blue\, and regularly ranks among America’s top-selling holiday albums every December.

The song\, co-written by James and Alonzo Miller\, was first released on James' album Street Songs and became one of James' signature songs. It features background vocals from Motown labelmates The Temptations\, in which the bass singer is James' uncle Melvin Franklin\, and Canadian singer Taborah Johnson. "Freak" is a slang term for\, as described in the song's lyrics\, "...a very kinky girl / The kind you don't take home to mother". Rolling Stone magazine ranked the song #477 in its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.  Chart history  The song was a big hit for James in 1981\, charting on the pop\, R&B and dance charts in the U.S. On the Billboard Hot 100 chart\, the song peaked at #16 in the fall of 1981 and spent 10 weeks in the top 40. Together with two other singles from Street Songs\, "Give It to Me Baby" and "Ghetto Life"\, it spent three weeks at #1 on the American dance charts earlier that year.  Cover versions  In 1984\, Los Angeles-based novelty band Big Daddy (whose comic conceit was to cover fast songs as ballads and slow songs up-tempo\, and all contemporary songs done in 1950s style) recorded the song to a slower beat as if it had been done by the Everly Brothers.  In 1989\, the song was covered by thrash metal band Mordred on their album Fool's Game.  In 2006\, Chicago-based alternative rock band Straitjacket covered this song on their album Vices.  In 2006\, a cover by Billy Crawford was included on the soundtrack to the 2006 animated film Asterix and the Vikings.  In 2007\, the song was covered in bluegrass style by Ricky Skaggs and Bruce Hornsby on their eponymous collaborative album.  Live cover performances  Australian Idol 4 finalist Bobby Flynn performed a version of the song in 2006.  In 2004\, the Dave Matthews Band covered Super Freak live on Alpine Valley Music Theatre. The song features on Live Trax Vol. 8.  The song was covered by Irish band Dirty Epics on The Podge and Rodge Show in February 2009.  Sampling  The riff of the song was most popularly sampled in 1989 by MC Hammer in his best known single\, "U Can't Touch This". The song was also sampled Wassuup by Da Muttz in 2001.  Hip hop artist GZA/Genius sampled the song on his debut 1991 album Words from the Genius.  In 1997\, artist Jude's song entitled "Rick James" (#28 Billboard Modern Rock Chart) featured the words "Oh\, Rick James was the original Super Freak" in its chorus line.  In 2006\, the Beatfreakz covered the song\, as "Superfreak"\, and gained a #7 UK hit with it.  The title track of Jay-Z's 2006 comeback album Kingdom Come features a sample from "Super Freak".  In the 2007 song "Freaky Gurl" by Gucci Mane\, the lines in the chorus pay homage to the original Rick James song.  In 2007\, French actor/rapper Disiz la Peste released a rap song in French that uses of "Super Freak" as the instrumental backing.  In popular culture  In the 1986 movie Heartbreak Ridge\, Mario Van Peebles as Corporal 'Stitch' Jones\, sings most of the song before he is thrown out of a bar.  An instrumental version of the song was featured in the 1992 movie Batman Returns.  In a 1998 episode of Just Shoot Me\, disappointed to find out she hadn't been the inspiration to the fictional song "Nina in The Cantina"\, Nina Van Horn found solace in the belief that she was at least the inspiration to Rick James' Super Freak.  In the 2006 comedy film Little Miss Sunshine\, Olive Hoover (Abigail Breslin) performs a burlesque routine to the song at a children's beauty pageant.  On the episode of One on One\, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air star Alfonso Ribeiro sings the song on the season 1 episode\, "Me and My Shadow" which originally aired in 2002 where Flex (Flex Alexander) and Duane (Kelly Perine) decide to have a high school band.  In Season 4 of the A-Team\, Rick James guest stars and performs this song in the episode 'The Heart of Rock n Roll'  In an episode of George Lopez\, George sings this song to the baby he thinks is in Angie's womb.	0

"As Time Goes By" is a song written by Herman Hupfeld in 1931. - Lyrics - You must remember this A kiss is just a kiss A sigh is just a sigh The fundamental things apply As time goes by And when two lovers woo They still say: I love you On that you can rely No matter what the future brings As time goes by Moonlight and love songs never out of date Hearts full of passion  jealousy and hate Woman needs man and man must have his mate That no one can deny It's still the same old story A fight for love and glory A case of do or die The world will always welcome lovers As time goes by  - Song and images belong to their respective owners -	1

Join our Youtube: https://goo.gl/8AOGaN Join our Facebook: http://goo.gl/5oL723 Charles Edward Anderson "Chuck" Berry (born October 18\, 1926) is an American guitarist\, singer and songwriter and is one of the pioneers of rock and roll music. With songs such as "Maybellene" (1955)\, "Roll Over Beethoven" (1956)\, "Rock and Roll Music" (1957) and "Johnny B. Goode" (1958)\, Berry refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive\, with lyrics focusing on teen life and consumerism and music featuring guitar solos and showmanship that were a major influence on subsequent rock music. Born into a middle-class African-American family in St. Louis\, Missouri\, Berry had an interest in music from an early age and gave his first public performance at Sumner High School. While still a high-school student he was convicted of armed robbery and was sent to a reformatory\, where he was held from 1944 to 1947. After his release\, Berry settled into married life and worked at an automobile assembly plant. By early 1953\, influenced by the guitar riffs and showmanship techniques of the blues musician T-Bone Walker\, Berry began performing with the Johnnie Johnson Trio. His break came when he traveled to Chicago in May 1955 and met Muddy Waters\, who suggested he contact Leonard Chess\, of Chess Records. With Chess he recorded "Maybellene"—Berry's adaptation of the country song "Ida Red"—which sold over a million copies\, reaching number one on Billboard magazine's rhythm and blues chart. By the end of the 1950s\, Berry was an established star with several hit records and film appearances and a lucrative touring career. He had also established his own St. Louis nightclub\, Berry's Club Bandstand. But in January 1962\, he was sentenced to three years in prison for offenses under the Mann Act—he had transported a 14-year-old girl across state lines.

COL title VAL Beauty and the Beast COL performer VAL Miúcha	COL video title VAL Roaring 20s: Leona Williams & Her Dixie Band - I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate\,     1922 COL channel name VAL 240252 COL description VAL I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate -- Leona Williams & Her Dixie Band\, Columbia 1922 (USA; accoustical recording)  NOTE: "I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate"; often simply "Sister Kate"\, is a jazz dance song\, written by Clarence Williams and Armand Piron\, and published in 1919.  The lyrics of the song are narrated first person by Kate's sister\, who sings about Kate's impressive dancing skill and her wish to be able to emulate it. She laments that she's not quite "up to date"\, but believes that dancing like "Sister Kate" will rectify this\, and she will be able to impress "all the boys in the neighborhood" like her sister.    The dance of "shmmy" was named after one of the belly-dance figures and was one of many manifestations of the increasing public interest in the Orient and the Oriental culture -- evoked by many factors\, like the archeological excavations in  Egypt as well as post-WW1 technological revolution  (esp.-- the long-distance plane flightsor the cruise-liner trips) which enabled  middle class people to take part in the modern style tourist journeys across the wast and formerly unattainable territories. However\, still exists another version of the birth of that strange word: according to one artristic legend\, it was a Polish dancer from  Cracow\, Marianna Michalska -- better known as "Gilda Grey" - who\, in her early days in America  and before her show\, where she was supposed to present the new  dance hit of the year 1918  -- said to her dresser in her broken English: - Gimmie'dat'shmisee (chemise).   Whatever did Gilda Grey really say - and in whatever chemise she made her first shimmy-steps on stage -- the new dance-trot in short time conquered dance floors all over the world. It is very difficult to describe\, in short terms\, what was the choreographic clue to a shimmy- my aunt\, who  in my famile carried a deserved title of a "ballroom queen" would once present it to me when I was a kid\, and I saw nothing but series of  con vulsive jigs\, jerks and belly shakes which rather unpleasantly contrasted with what I considered as a sensuous logic of the waltz\, of tango or even -- of the charleston (which came several years later\, in 1924).   In Poland\, shimmy was made popular by the Warsaw operette diva Lucyna Messal\, who presented it at the Polish premiere of Emmerich Kalman's operette "Bayadera". in 1923. E.Kalman's hit "Każda piękność tańczy shimmy" (Ev'ry Beauty Dances Shimmy)   became one of the international evergreens and is still considered as the key shimmy-tune in the history of the lighter music in Europe. In YT are available several excellent modern renditions of that Kalman's song\, from among which the most instructive and presented in a breathtaking & hot manner is a presentation by young Hungarian dancers http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUJMBAEfo-g  Also\, very picturesque is Russian version entitled  "Ah Mademoiselle\, stan'tsueem shimmy?" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl06NffV3b0 or amusing presentation by the Italian Operette artists\, under the title "Signorina vuol ballare lo shimmy ?" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvS2ZNFGDe0   In USA\, where Kalman's operetta has never been such a hit like in Europe\, the key shimmy tune has always been the Clarence William's/Piron jazzy tune "I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate". Also\, very popular was Spencer William's tune "Shimme-Sha-Wabble" http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xiypoj_red-nichols-his-5-pennies-shim-me-sha-wabble-1930_music#.Ud8RAJH5v0Q .

She takes two songs that I've been waiting for someone to cover since Fruits de Mer was still a winkle in someone's eye -- The Troggs' disturbed and disturbing  'Cousin Jane' and the long-lost Second Hand's 1968 classic 'A Fairy Tale' - and adds a carefully-crafted 'Play With Fire'\, previously recorded by the little-known rock combo\, The Rolling Stones. With a great production by Icarus Peel\, 'Play with Fire' is presented here - but only an excerpt (I want you to buy the vinyl!)  more details at www.fruitsdemerrecords.com	0

Il faisait la guerre avec ses amis Dedans la fumée\, Dedans les métros\, Dedans les pavés\, Dedans les bistrots. Il ne savait pas qu'il en était saoûl. Il ne savait pas qu'il dormait debout. Paris le tenait par la peau du cou.  {Refrain:} Ah ! Les pommiers doux\, Rondes et ritournelles. J'ai pas peur des loups\, Chantonnait la belle. Ils ne sont pas méchants Avec les enfants Qu'ont le cœur fidèle Et les genoux blancs...  Sous un pommier doux\, il l'a retrouvée\, Croisant le soleil avec la rosée. Vivent les chansons pour les Bien-aimées. Je me souviens d'elle au sang de velours. Elle avait des mains qui parlaient d'amour Et tressait l'argile avec les nuages Et pressait le vent contre son visage Pour en exprimer l'huile des voyages.  {Refrain}  "Adieu mon Paris"\, dit le chevalier. "J'ai dormi cent ans\, debout sans manger Les pommes d'argent de mes doux pommiers." Alors le village a crié si fort Que toutes les filles ont couru dehors Mais le chevalier n'a salué qu'elle Au sang de velours\, au cœur tant fidèle\, Chevalier fera la guerre en dentelles.  {Refrain}	0

It takes a great singer to really do justice to Dylan\, yet KT goes well beyond that and makes this her own. She's just that good live.  I work nights in a television studio and used to come home in the morning to find absolutely nothing interesting to watch on television. The last thing I wanted to see was more commercials. And I'm not really interested in watching talk shows and soap operas.  Then I discovered the commercial free music channel RAVE. HD quality video and pretty much perfect 5.1 sound. A few times a week they run "Later With Jools Holland" in the morning. Jools has great taste in music and each show runs the gamut from pop\, rock\, folk\, Celtic\, African\, to Joanna Newsome. Something for everyone. Suffice to say I love this show.  Uploaded as a high quality 640 x 480 MPEG4 file using Pinnacle Studio.

COL description VAL Recorded in 1952 with "Heart and Soul" on the flipside. A pair of Philadelphia boys\, Al Alberts and Dave Mahoney\, finding themselves in the North Atlantic in the Navy in WWII\, killed time by singing together. Joining two more local boys\, Rosario and Louis\, they formed the Four Aces\, following in the footsteps of the Ames Brothers. Their first hit was "(It's No) Sin\," which was shopped to no avail to New York record companies\, and finally released by Al\, who started his own record company\, Victoria Records\, to do it. The song peaked on Billboard's charts at #4 in 1951\, and the Aces were quickly signed by Decca. The group-written "Tell Me Why\," "A Garden in the Rain\," "Perfidia\," "I'm Yours" and "Heart and Soul" were next to climb high on the charts. Appearing frequently on TV\, Aces singles "La Rosita\," "Just Squeeze Me\," "Laughing on the Outside" and "The Gang that Sang (Heart of My Heart)" were among 8 of the group's hits in 1952. "Stranger in Paradise" went to #2 on the charts\, which the Aces finally topped with the theme from the movie "Three Coins in a Fountain." Popular hits "Dream" and "So Long\," followed\, and "Mr. Sandman" and "Melody of Love" scored in Billboard's top five before the floodgates of Rock 'n Roll opened in 1955\, and even that year the Aces had another chart-topper with "Love is a Many Splendored Thing."	0

COL title VAL Harlem Nocturne COL performer VAL Carla White	COL video title VAL Harlem Nocturne - Johnny Otis And His Orchestra COL channel name VAL althazarr's good time oldies COL description VAL Recorded in 1945. The Excelsior record label was established by Otis René in 1944\, and ceased operations in 1951. It is particularly notable for having released some of the first recordings by Nat King Cole. Otis René was noted to have earned $25\,000 on one song in 1945\, "I'm Lost"\, recorded by the King Cole Trio. René had written and produced the song\, as well distributed the record.  Otis René is best known as the co-author of the 1931 song "When It's Sleepy Time Down South"\, co-written with his brother Leon René\, and Clarence Muse. Other songs co-written by Otis René include "Someone's Rocking My Dreamboat"\, included by Murray Head on his 1975 album Say It Ain't So and "That's My Home"\, included by Tony Bennett on his 2002 album\, A Wonderful World. Prior to devoting his full-time efforts to music\, Otis René was a pharmacist in New Orleans. During the 1940s\, with his brother\,Leon René\, Otis René established and ran the independent rhythm and blues labels Exclusive Records and Excelsior Records. Otis was responsible for and publicly identified with Excelsior Records\, while his brother Leon was indentified with Exclusive Records.  In 1945\, René was elected president of the newly-established Pacific Coast Record Manufacturers' Association. In support of their record labels\, Otis René and Leon René purchased their own record plant\, but when the format changed from 78 rpm to 45rpm\, they could not press the new speed. Otis René's Excelsior label existed from 1944 to 1951. His brother Leon's Exclusive Records existed from 1944 to 1949. Artists on Otis René's label included Herb Jeffries\, Timmie Rogers and the Al Russell Trio. In 1952\, with saxophonist Preston Love\, René launched the short-lived Spin Records. The label released material by the Preston Love Orchestra\, among others.	1

The "Rubber Band"\,a group from Scandinavia (Denmark?Sweden?)\, they started in 1979\, when it was still considered blasphemous to copy The Beatles\, and their music. Despite this opinion\, that was held by most of the general public\, Rubber Band continued to rehearse with dedication\, until their first public performance as "Billerne". (They later changed their name to Rubber Band\, inspired by The Beatles LP "Rubber Soul"). "X'mas - The Beatmas" recorded this Christmas songs CD by using the arrangement of the Beatles' songs. The "Rubber Band" managed to arrange and play Christmas songs using the real "Beatles sound" and instrumentation. The casual listener will immediately think that's the real Beatles.	0

COL title VAL Sweet Lorraine COL performer VAL Nat "King" Cole and His Trio	COL video title VAL JOHNNY MATHIS sweet Lorraine (1958) COL channel name VAL OubaelPhoumet COL description VAL album : Swing softly  Johnny Mathis may swing softly\, but he does swing. This 1958 album features upbeat interpretations of pop standards like "You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To" and "I've Got the World on a String" performed with Percy Faith and his orchestra. Close listeners will appreciate the purity of Mathis' vocal technique\, which differs markedly from that of later singers for its infrequent use of modulation. Mathis was an album artist\, as Swing Softly -- a hit album without a hit single -- proves. Although he is known for his sensitive balladry\, Mathis swings with ease on these 12 favorites and offers something a little bit different from his previous albums.	1

COL title VAL Stay with Me COL performer VAL Lorraine Ellison	COL video title VAL Elaine Stritch -- You Took Advantage of Me COL channel name VAL OldieMusicMan COL description VAL This is my favorite performance of "You Took Advantage of Me" out there. Even compared to other renditions of the same song by other powerhouse vocalists like Anita O'Day\, Bobby Short\, and my favorite jazz vocalist ever\, Ella Fitzgerald\, Elaine Stritch's remains my favorite. (My second favorite version is Judy Garland's performance in her "Born in a Trunk" medley; sadly\, it is disconnected\, not a through-and-through like it should have been). Her brassy\, throaty\, mostly straight-toned vocals seem those for which this song works best.  I hate that Elaine Stritch's voice has suffered as it has through time\, thanks to booze and cigarettes. In her prime\, she was as good a singer as anyone out there\, and ten times as unique. "C'est la vie" as our friends in France might say. We still have recordings like this to prove that\, at some point\, she WAS a singer.  ** I DO NOT OWN THE COPYRIGHT TO THIS RECORDING.

That version is by far the most well-known of this tune. The tune was very popular in the Soviet Union and was featured in one of the Nu\, pogodi! animated series.  Original version - Background  Composer Gershon Kingsley (of Perrey and Kingsley) first recorded it for his 1969 album Music to Moog By. In 1971 the song was re-recorded by Kingsley's band First Moog Quartet. Stan Free\, member of the First Moog Quartet\, rerecorded the instrumental with his band Hot Butter in 1972.  The title refers to the short staccato or sharp "popping" sound used.  Other cover versions  It has since been covered by various artists\, including: DJ Voyager\, Anarchic System with vocal version\, a pre-fame Jean Michel Jarre (under the pseudonyms of The Popcorn Orchestra and Jamie Jefferson)\, Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops\, Unter Null\, Richard D. James AKA Aphex Twin\, M&H Band\, Muse\, DJ Fantomas\, Gigi D'Agostino\, Guru Josh\, Iranian artist Shadmehr Aghili\, Afrosound\, The Time Frequency (TTF)\, Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass\, Norrie Paramor & the Midland Radio Orchestra\, Ronnie Aldrich\, The Treble Spankers\, the Boomtang Boys\, Space Penguins\, Pattie Brooks (disco version as part of a medley that also included Black is Black & Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye)\, Bass Bumpers (fronted by the Crazy Frog cartoon)\, Liars\, Finnish band Seidat\, Swedish DJ Richi M\, the Irish DJ Showey\, South African Psytrance act Parana\, Italian pop band La Strana Società\, Japanese electronic artists Denki Groove\, Russian Virtuoso Guitar Player Victor Zinchuk\, Spanish rock band Los Pekenikes\, Shadowy Men On A Shadowy Planet and the Swedish Chef.  It has also been remixed by Hexstatic on the Pick 'n' Mix album. In 2003 Greek synthpop Duo Marsheaux released a darker mix of "Popcorn" as their debut single\, which became a radio play hit in Europe. The song was also featured as the background music in the first version of the 1982 arcade game Pengo\, the 1983 IBM PC game Digger\, and the 1984 Mikro-Gen microcomputer game Pyjamarama.  Many cover versions were made on popular home computers such as Atari\, ZX Spectrum\, Commodore 64 and Amiga\, often by anonymous artists. On the 17th of September\, 2007\, Electropop group Plemo released a free track on micromusic.net based on the original "Popcorn" melody. It includes samples from "(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)" of the Beastie Boys. In 1976\, the tenth episode of Nu\, Pogodi! includes this song as Volk (The Wolf) tries to get closer and closer to Zayats (The Hare) at a construction site.  Big band arranger James Last recorded "Popcorn" in 1972  The song has never been covered by Kraftwerk although there are mistagged copies of the song allegedly by them (most frequently the version by M&H Band) in circulation. There is also a version circulating on the internet that is claimed to have been made by avant-garde group The Residents even though it sounds vastly different from The Residents' usual experimental sound. This version is actually made by the hard house artists called The Rezidents\, hence the confusion between the two.  A variation of "Popcorn" was used by WDIV in Detroit\, Michigan as background music for the station's Michigan Lottery Lotto drawings during the 1980s.  Most recently\, alternative rock band Muse performed this song live in Teignmouth\, UK during their two nights at The Den. The song featured prominent electric guitar along with heavy percussion and bass. A studio version of their cover was released on the 2010 single "Resistance". Faith No More covered the song live in Argentina in The Second Coming Tour.  The Muppets recorded a cover of the song featuring it as the theme of a new Swedish Chef sketch\, hence its naming as Pöpcørn\, which was released in July 2010.  Other uses  The song was used in the 1982 arcade game Pengo and the next year in the PC video game Digger.	0

COL title VAL Love Me Do COL performer VAL The Beatles	COL video title VAL WHEN I TAKE MY SUGAR TO TEA (1947) by the Nat King Cole Trio COL channel name VAL wilson mcphert COL description VAL Early in his career\, Nat King Cole started a ground breaking trio in 1937\, playing piano with Oscar Moore on guitar and Wesley Prince on bass. This version of the King Cole Trio (as it was known) played a mixture of novelty songs\, jazz and pop tunes\, often with unison singing from all three members\, as well as Nat's lead vocal.   When Prince was drafted\, Johnny Miller took over on bass in 1942\, and by this time\, Nat's voice was more to the fore\, and there were less novelty songs. The melody to this song was written by Sammy Fain\, and the lyrics by Irving Kahal and Pierre Norman in 1931. It was released by the trio in 1947\, and later that same year Oscar Moore left to be replaced by Irving Ashby. The trio kept going until Nat's career really took off with singing ballads backed mainly by orchestras. At this point\, Nat was not playing much piano\, which was a pity\, as he was a really hot and infuential jazz pianist.   I have put a slide show video together using as many images of this version of the trio that I could find. Comments are welcome.	0

COL title VAL Keep a Knockin' COL performer VAL The Trashmen	COL video title VAL Grant Green_I Remember You COL channel name VAL rapitroy COL description VAL Personnel: Grant Green (guitar); Wilbur Ware (bass); Al Harewood (drums) (1961)  Producer: Alfred Lion.  Reissue producer: Michael Cuscuna.  Recorded at the Van Gelder Studio\, Englewood Cliffs\, New Jersey on August 29\, 1961. Includes liner notes by Pete Welding.  Digitally remastered using 20-bit technology by Ron McMaster.  Grant Green has always been somewhat neglected in the pantheon of jazz guitarists. Lacking the flash of Wes Montgomery and the cerebral intensity of Jim Hall\, his strengths tended to be overlooked\, but these strengths are well exhibited on STANDARDS.  Green brings a geometric simplicity to the melody of "You Stepped Out of a Dream\," his solos unfolding with more light than heat. On Gershwin's charming "Love Walked In\," his solo tumbles gently through the changes. He pauses to reflect on a note now and then\, giving the time elasticity and looseness rather than propulsion. Bassist Wilbur Ware is similarly underrated. It's hard to understand why--his pulse and sense of the architecture of a tune are without parallel. His rock-solid time on the ballad "If I Had You" shows why he was held in such high esteem by other musicians. Green and Ware work together like a pair of safecrackers\, each deftly anticipating and complementing the moves of the other\, while drummer Al Harewood keeps steady watch. This set of terse\, swinging jazz goes a long way towards fixing Grant Green's place in the jazz guitar firmament.	0

COL title VAL In mijn ogen kun je zien wat ik bedoel COL performer VAL Ton Kas	COL video title VAL Gerry Gibbs - 2015 - Live In Studio - 04 Spartacus Love Theme COL channel name VAL JazzTube COL description VAL Personnel Kenny Barron: piano Ron Carter: acoustic bass Gerry Gibbs: drums  Composers Alex North  Drummer Gerry Gibbs has been living a recurring dream with slight variations for the past few years. In December of 2012\, he laid down tracks with two of his idols—the legendary Ron Carter and the estimable Kenny Barron—and dubbed their group the Thrasher Dream Trio. The eponymous debut from that band\, featuring fifteen tracks recorded at those sessions\, was\, not surprisingly\, a strong and classy affair filled with standards\, some originals\, and other jazz-friendly fare\, such as Stevie Wonder's "Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing" and Burt Bacharach's "Promises\, Promises."   At the time of that album's release\, those last-mentioned tracks could simply be viewed as part of the well-rounded program. But looking back now\, it actually seems like they were dropped as hints of what was to come. About a year-and-a-half after that first Thrasher Dream Trio album was recorded\, Gibbs brought the band together again to lay things down for We're Back (Whaling City Sound\, 2014)\, a jazz-does-R&B project with A-list guests—vibraphonist Warren Wolf\, saxophonist Steve Wilson\, and organist Larry Goldings. That album offered multiple helpings of Wonder and Earth\, Wind & Fire along with single servings of Bacharach\, Marvin Gaye\, Miles Davis\, and the Average White Band. As on the trio's first album\, the sparks were flying. The playing field\, however\, had changed a bit.   For this\, the third go-around for this group\, Gibbs does it again\, tweaking the formula without altering the essence of the trio. This time he turned the focus toward pop-ish material from the '50s and '60s—the work of Bacharach\, Henry Mancini\, Michel Legrand\, and others of that ilk—and put an audience in front of the band\, recording live at Systems Two Recording Studio. Guests are part of the package again—now it's trumpeter Roy Hargrove and vocalist Cassandra Wilson\, each appearing on a few tracks—and they help to add another wrinkle or two to the project without drawing focus away from the trio.   The album opens on a fluid "Wives And Lovers" that allows Barron's lyricism to shine through\, gives Carter a chance to step into the spotlight\, and puts Gibbs' brushwork at center stage. From there\, the trio moves on with an unusually upbeat take on "The Summer Knows\," a Wilson-enhanced version of "The Look Of Love" that moves from bossa nova to swing\, and a variety of other familiar hits of yesteryear. Hargrove joins in for "On A Clear Day\," quoting Ellington at one point and playfully trading solos with Gibbs; Vince Guaraldi's cheerfulness shines through on a perky trio performance of his "Cast Your Fate To The Wind"; "More" is transformed from a stale confection into an enjoyable swinger; and "Watch What Happens" happens twice—first as a cheerful\, Brazilian-based instrumental\, then as a swing-centered feature for Wilson.   Along the way there are plenty of other bright spots—an appropriately noir-ish "What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life?" with Hargrove on flugelhorn\, a leisurely stroll through "Girl Talk"—and plenty of moments that serve as simple reminders as to why Barron and Carter are loved\, respected\, and emulated the world over. Their time and taste are impeccable\, and when married to Gibbs' in-the-tradition drumming\, you know the music is going to go in the right direction every time.	0

"I'll Get By (As Long as I Have You)" is a popular song with music by Fred E. Ahlert and lyrics by Roy Turk. It was published in 1928 and originally sung by Aileen Stanley. Ruth Etting (November 23\, 1897 — September 24\, 1978) was an American singing star and actress of the 1920s and 1930s\, who had over 60 hit recordings and worked in stage\, radio\, and film.  Born in David City\, Nebraska in 1897 to Alfred and Winifred (née Kleinhan) Etting. When Ruth was five years old\, her mother died and she went to live with her paternal grandparents\, George and Hannah Etting. Alfred Etting remarried and moved away from David City and largely out of his daughter's life. Ruth Etting left David City at the age of seventeen to attend art school in Chicago. Her job designing costumes at the Marigold Gardens nightclub led to employment singing and dancing in the chorus there. She became a featured vocalist at the nightclub\, and married gangster Martin "Moe the Gimp" Snyder on July 12\, 1922. He managed her career\, booking radio appearances\, and eventually had her signed to an exclusive recording contract with Columbia Records. She made her Broadway debut in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1927. She went on to appear in a number of other hit shows in rapid succession\, including Simple Simon and Whoopee!. In Hollywood\, she made a long series of movie shorts between 1929 and 1936\, and three feature movies in 1933 and 1934. In 1936\, she appeared in London in Ray Henderson's Transatlantic Rhythm. Etting divorced Moe Snyder on November 30\, 1937\, aged 40. She fell in love with her pianist\, Myrl Alderman\, but in 1938 he was shot and injured by her ex-husband. Snyder was convicted of attempted murder\, but released on appeal after one year in jail. Etting married Alderman\, who was almost a decade her junior\, in December 1938. The scandal of the sensational trial in Los Angeles effectively ended her career\, though she briefly had a radio show in 1947. Alderman died on November 16\, 1966. Ruth Etting died in Colorado Springs\, Colorado in 1978\, aged 80. She had no children. Her life was the basis for the fictionalized 1955 film\, Love Me or Leave Me\, which starred Doris Day (as Etting) and James Cagney (as Snyder).	0

Valley (tracks: A1\,A2\,A5\,A6\,B1\,B2\,B6)  Producer -- Willie Dunnit  ------------------------  Origin and early versions  The oldest known existing recording is by Appalachian artists Clarence Ashley and Gwen Foster and was made in 1933. Ashley said he had learned it from his grandfather\, Enoch Ashley. Alger "Texas" Alexander's "The Risin' Sun\," recorded in 1928\, is sometimes mentioned as the first recording\, but is a completely different song.  The song might have been lost to obscurity had it not been collected by folklorist Alan Lomax\, who\, along with his father\, was a curator of the Archive of American Folk Song for the Library of Congress. On an expedition with his wife to eastern Kentucky Lomax set up his recording equipment in Middlesborough\, Kentucky in the house of a singer and activist called Tilman Cadle. On September 15\, 1937 he recorded a performance by Georgia Turner\, the 16 year-old daughter of a local miner. He called it "The Risin' Sun Blues." Lomax later recorded a different version sung by Bert Martin and a third sung by Daw Henson\, both eastern Kentucky singers. In his 1941 songbook Our Singing Country\, Lomax credits the lyrics to Turner\, with reference to Martin's version. According to his later writing\, the melody bears similarities to the traditional English ballad "Matty Groves." Roy Acuff\, who recorded the song on November 3\, 1938\, may have learned the song from Clarence Ashley\, with whom he sometimes performed. In 1941\, Woody Guthrie recorded a version. A recording made in 1947 by Josh White\, who is also credited with having written new words and music that have subsequently been popularized in the versions made by many other later artists\, was released by Mercury Records in 1950. Lead Belly recorded two versions of the song in February 1944 and in October 1948 called "In New Orleans" and "The House of the Rising Sun" respectively\, and the latter was recorded in the sessions that later became the album Lead Belly's Last Sessions (1994\, Smithsonian Folkways). In 1957 Glenn Yarbrough recorded the song for Elektra Records. The song is also credited to Ronnie Gilbert on one of The Weavers albums with Pete Seeger that was released in the late 1940s or early 1950s. Frankie Laine recorded the song then titled "New Orleans" on his 1959 album Balladeer. Joan Baez recorded it in 1960 on her eponymous debut album\, and has included it in her live set list\, frequently including the song in her concerts throughout her career. In 1960 Miriam Makeba recorded the song on her eponymous RCA album. In late 1961\, Bob Dylan recorded the song for his eponymous debut album\, released in March 1962. There is no songwriting credit\, but the liner notes indicate that Dylan learned this version of the song from Dave Van Ronk. In an interview on the documentary No Direction Home\, Van Ronk said that he was intending to record the song\, and that Dylan copied his version. He recorded it soon thereafter on Just Dave Van Ronk. I had learned it sometime in the 1950s\, from a recording by Hally Wood\, the Texas singer and collector\, who had got it from an Alan Lomax field recording by a Kentucky woman named Georgia Turner. I put a different spin on it by altering the chords and using a bass line that descended in half steps—a common enough progression in jazz\, but unusual among folksingers. By the early 1960s\, the song had become one of my signature pieces\, and I could hardly get off the stage without doing it. —Dave Van Ronk  Nina Simone recorded her first version on Nina at the Village Gate in 1962. Later versions include the 1965 recording in Colombia by Los Speakers in Spanish called "La casa del sol naciente"\, which was also the title of their second album. They earned a silver record (for sales of over 15\,000 copies). The Chambers Brothers recorded a version on "Feelin' The Blues"\, released on VAULT records. Much later\, English rock band Muse recorded a version for the War Child charity.  Cover versions  The Animals Frijid Pink Dolly Parton Toto HOT R.S. Gregory Isaacs Skitzo	0

COL title VAL My Colouring Book COL performer VAL Agnetha Fältskog	COL video title VAL Elaine Stritch -- You Took Advantage of Me COL channel name VAL OldieMusicMan COL description VAL This is my favorite performance of "You Took Advantage of Me" out there. Even compared to other renditions of the same song by other powerhouse vocalists like Anita O'Day\, Bobby Short\, and my favorite jazz vocalist ever\, Ella Fitzgerald\, Elaine Stritch's remains my favorite. (My second favorite version is Judy Garland's performance in her "Born in a Trunk" medley; sadly\, it is disconnected\, not a through-and-through like it should have been). Her brassy\, throaty\, mostly straight-toned vocals seem those for which this song works best.  I hate that Elaine Stritch's voice has suffered as it has through time\, thanks to booze and cigarettes. In her prime\, she was as good a singer as anyone out there\, and ten times as unique. "C'est la vie" as our friends in France might say. We still have recordings like this to prove that\, at some point\, she WAS a singer.  ** I DO NOT OWN THE COPYRIGHT TO THIS RECORDING.

COL title VAL Rock This Town COL performer VAL Guana Batz	COL video title VAL Elvis Presley - Money Honey COL channel name VAL Music Legends Book COL description VAL Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8\, 1935 – August 16\, 1977) was an American singer and actor. Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century\, he is often referred to as "the King of Rock and Roll"\, or simply\, "the King". Presley was born in Tupelo\, Mississippi as a twinless twin\, and when he was 13 years old\, he and his family relocated to Memphis\, Tennessee. His music career began there in 1954\, when he recorded a song with producer Sam Phillips at Sun Records. Accompanied by guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black\, Presley was an early popularizer of rockabilly\, an uptempo\, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker\, who managed the singer for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single\, "Heartbreak Hotel"\, was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. He was regarded as the leading figure of rock and roll after a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style\, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines that coincided with the dawn of the Civil Rights Movement\, made him enormously popular and controversial. In November 1956\, he made his film debut in Love Me Tender. In 1958\, he was drafted into military service. He resumed his recording career two years later\, producing some of his most commercially successful work before devoting much of the 1960s to making Hollywood movies and their accompanying soundtrack albums\, most of which were critically derided. In 1968\, following a seven-year break from live performances\, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed televised comeback special Elvis\, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973\, Presley was featured in the first globally broadcast concert via satellite\, Aloha from Hawaii. Several years of prescription drug abuse severely damaged his health\, and he died in 1977 at the age of 42. Presley is one of the most celebrated and influential musicians of the 20th century. Commercially successful in many genres\, including pop\, blues and gospel\, he is the best-selling solo artist in the history of recorded music\, with estimated record sales of around 600 million units worldwide. He won three Grammys\, also receiving the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36\, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame. Forbes named Elvis Presley as the 2nd top earning dead celebrity with $55 million as of 2011.	0

COL title VAL Climb Ev'ry Mountain COL performer VAL Judith Durham	COL video title VAL Donna Loren sings "Call Me" on Hollywood-A-Go-Go (1965) COL channel name VAL Donna Loren COL description VAL More Info: http://www.DonnaLoren.com -  Donna Loren performs the Tony Hatch penned "Call Me" on the Los Angeles-based teen variety show "Hollywood-A-Go-Go" hosted by L.A. DJ Sam Riddle on 12-25-65. Arranged by none other than Jack Nitzsche and produced by saxophonist extraordinaire Steve Douglas. Tony Hatch wrote many of Petula Clark's hits including "Downtown". This record introduced a new\, softer vocal style for Donna\, which was released by Capitol Records in 1965. Donna also performed this song live on The Milton Berle Show in a legitimate stage style in 1966 when she was a regular on the show. You will find that performance on YouTube if you go to my channel. "Call Me" was originally a hit for Petula Clark (UK) and Chris Montez (US).   Donna Loren was the one-and-only "Dr Pepper Girl" from 1963 to 1968. She was signed to a long-term contract with the soft-drink company to sing all television and radio commercials\, do all magazine and billboard advertising representing them in every capacity\, sometimes sharing the spotlight with American Bandstand's Dick Clark. This relationship led to her touring in Dick Clark's Caravan of Stars with other popular acts like Diana Ross and The Supremes and singing solos in the popular Beach Party films starring Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon. Later\, she became the regular female vocalist on the popular 60's American live rock n roll TV show "Shindig" and she appeared in singing and acting roles in many iconic TV shows like Batman\, The Monkees\, Gomer Pyle\, The Mothers-In-Law\, Red Skelton\, Milton Berle and various game shows. She's released 22 singles\, an album and 2 CD's. Ms Loren is currently in the studio again making music: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ-wN37G2rs  Current Videos: Donna Loren Now channel.

Valley (tracks: A1\,A2\,A5\,A6\,B1\,B2\,B6)  Producer -- Willie Dunnit  ------------------------  Origin and early versions  The oldest known existing recording is by Appalachian artists Clarence Ashley and Gwen Foster and was made in 1933. Ashley said he had learned it from his grandfather\, Enoch Ashley. Alger "Texas" Alexander's "The Risin' Sun\," recorded in 1928\, is sometimes mentioned as the first recording\, but is a completely different song.  The song might have been lost to obscurity had it not been collected by folklorist Alan Lomax\, who\, along with his father\, was a curator of the Archive of American Folk Song for the Library of Congress. On an expedition with his wife to eastern Kentucky Lomax set up his recording equipment in Middlesborough\, Kentucky in the house of a singer and activist called Tilman Cadle. On September 15\, 1937 he recorded a performance by Georgia Turner\, the 16 year-old daughter of a local miner. He called it "The Risin' Sun Blues." Lomax later recorded a different version sung by Bert Martin and a third sung by Daw Henson\, both eastern Kentucky singers. In his 1941 songbook Our Singing Country\, Lomax credits the lyrics to Turner\, with reference to Martin's version. According to his later writing\, the melody bears similarities to the traditional English ballad "Matty Groves." Roy Acuff\, who recorded the song on November 3\, 1938\, may have learned the song from Clarence Ashley\, with whom he sometimes performed. In 1941\, Woody Guthrie recorded a version. A recording made in 1947 by Josh White\, who is also credited with having written new words and music that have subsequently been popularized in the versions made by many other later artists\, was released by Mercury Records in 1950. Lead Belly recorded two versions of the song in February 1944 and in October 1948 called "In New Orleans" and "The House of the Rising Sun" respectively\, and the latter was recorded in the sessions that later became the album Lead Belly's Last Sessions (1994\, Smithsonian Folkways). In 1957 Glenn Yarbrough recorded the song for Elektra Records. The song is also credited to Ronnie Gilbert on one of The Weavers albums with Pete Seeger that was released in the late 1940s or early 1950s. Frankie Laine recorded the song then titled "New Orleans" on his 1959 album Balladeer. Joan Baez recorded it in 1960 on her eponymous debut album\, and has included it in her live set list\, frequently including the song in her concerts throughout her career. In 1960 Miriam Makeba recorded the song on her eponymous RCA album. In late 1961\, Bob Dylan recorded the song for his eponymous debut album\, released in March 1962. There is no songwriting credit\, but the liner notes indicate that Dylan learned this version of the song from Dave Van Ronk. In an interview on the documentary No Direction Home\, Van Ronk said that he was intending to record the song\, and that Dylan copied his version. He recorded it soon thereafter on Just Dave Van Ronk. I had learned it sometime in the 1950s\, from a recording by Hally Wood\, the Texas singer and collector\, who had got it from an Alan Lomax field recording by a Kentucky woman named Georgia Turner. I put a different spin on it by altering the chords and using a bass line that descended in half steps—a common enough progression in jazz\, but unusual among folksingers. By the early 1960s\, the song had become one of my signature pieces\, and I could hardly get off the stage without doing it. —Dave Van Ronk  Nina Simone recorded her first version on Nina at the Village Gate in 1962. Later versions include the 1965 recording in Colombia by Los Speakers in Spanish called "La casa del sol naciente"\, which was also the title of their second album. They earned a silver record (for sales of over 15\,000 copies). The Chambers Brothers recorded a version on "Feelin' The Blues"\, released on VAULT records. Much later\, English rock band Muse recorded a version for the War Child charity.  Cover versions  The Animals Frijid Pink Dolly Parton Toto HOT R.S. Gregory Isaacs Skitzo	1

This 1958 album features upbeat interpretations of pop standards like "You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To" and "I've Got the World on a String" performed with Percy Faith and his orchestra. Close listeners will appreciate the purity of Mathis' vocal technique\, which differs markedly from that of later singers for its infrequent use of modulation. Mathis was an album artist\, as Swing Softly -- a hit album without a hit single -- proves. Although he is known for his sensitive balladry\, Mathis swings with ease on these 12 favorites and offers something a little bit different from his previous albums.	0

COL title VAL Makin' Whoopee COL performer VAL Sydney Claire	COL video title VAL Li'l Darlin' By Chuck Wayne COL channel name VAL texpaco COL description VAL Having listened to countless other versions over the past 50 years\, this to me is still the definitive rendition of this jazz classic.  Chuck Wayne was a jazz guitarist who first came to prominence in the 1940s.  He is best known for his work with Woody Herman's First Herd\, and for being the first guitarist in the George Shearing quintet.  He also played with trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie and in the '50s he recorded some albums for the Progressive label as a leader.  He released his first albums in 1953\, the best known being "The Jazz Guitarist".  He also was Tony Bennett's music director and accompanist from 1954-1957.  He had a distinctive\, swinging bebop style and developed an unusual legato technique\, not widely adopted by others until decades later.  He also had a lot of non-jazz activities which ranged from writing for Broadway to working as a staff musician for CBS-TV.  In his heyday he worked with many great vocalists including Sarah Vaughn\, Frank Sinatra\, and Barbra Streisand.   While not widely known outside the jazz circles\, he was a major influence on numerous guitarists who imitated his style.  During the 1980s he taught at the Westchester Conservatory of Music in suburban White Plains\, NY.  This Neal Hefti classic is from his album "Morning Mist" released in 1964.  "Morning Mist" was remastered and released as a CD in 2003.	0

Sehorn\, Wilbert Harrison  Recorded at Reflection Sound Studio\, Charlotte\, N.C.  Remixed at Select Sound Studios  ------------------------  "My Babe" is a blues song and a blues standard written by Willie Dixon for Little Walter. Released in 1955 on Checker Records\, a subsidiary of Chess Records\, the song was the only Dixon composition ever to become a no. 1 R&B single\, and it was one of the biggest hits of either of their careers.   The song was based on the traditional gospel song "This Train (Is Bound For Glory)"\, which Sister Rosetta Tharpe recorded in the 1939 hit\, "This Train". Dixon reworked the arrangement and lyrics from the sacred\, the procession of saints into Heaven\, into the secular\, a story about a woman that won't stand for her man to cheat: "My baby\, she don't stand no cheating\, my babe\, she don't stand none of that midnight creeping".  Ray Charles had famously\, and controversially\, pioneered the gospel-song-to-secular-song approach with his reworking of the gospel hymn "It Must Be Jesus." into "I Got a Woman"\, which hit the Billboard R&B charts on January 22\, 1955\, later climbing to the #1 position for one week. Within days of the appearance of Charles's song on the national charts\, Little Walter entered the studio to record "My Babe"\, on January 25\, 1955. "My Babe" was released while "I've Got A Woman" was still on the charts\, and eclipsed Charles's record by spending 19 weeks on the Billboard R&B charts beginning on March 12\, 1955\, including five weeks at the number one position\, making it one of the biggest R&B hits of 1955.  The "B" side of "My Babe" was the harmonica instrumental "Thunderbird"\, following the pattern established by the release of Little Walter's number #1 hit single from 1952\, "Juke"\, of featuring a vocal performance one side and a harmonica instrumental on the flip side.  Recording  Although no documentation exists\, the song was probably recorded at Universal Recorders in Chicago\, the site of the majority of Chess and Checker sessions until Chess opened their own studio c. 1956/'57. Backing Little Walter's vocals and harmonica were Robert Lockwood\, Jr. and Leonard Caston on guitars\, Willie Dixon on double-bass\, and Fred Below on drums.  Guitarist Luther Tucker\, then a member of Walter's band\, was absent from the recording session that day. "My Babe" was re-issued in 1961 with an overdubbed female vocal backing chorus and briefly crossed over to the pop charts.   Cover Versions  The success of song lead to dozens of cover versions by many diverse artists: Elvis Presley released a live cover on the album From Memphis to Vegas/From Vegas to Memphis Dale Hawkins released "My Babe" as a single by Checker Records Chuck Berry covered the song on Chuck Berry in 1975 The song was performed by Little Walter\, Bo Diddley\, and Muddy Waters on Super Blues Sonny Burgess and the Pacers on their self-titled album Cliff Richard on Cliff Ricky Nelson on his 1958 album Ricky Nelson Peter & Gordon on In Touch With... Donald Byrd on Up with Donald Byrd Ronnie Milsap on Just for a Thrill Conway Twitty\, Ramsey Lewis\, Grant Green\, Mississippi Fred McDowell\, Coleman Hawkins\, Gene Ammons\, The Everly Brothers\, The Animals\,the Steve Miller Band\, Lou Rawls\, Ike & Tina Turner\, and many others have also covered the song. Mose Allison rewrote it as "My Brain" and recorded it for his 2010 album "The Way of the World". The song "My Babe" by the Spencer Davis Group (Stevie Winwood) on their first album is a different song. "My Babe" was performed by Ben Harper\, with James Cotton sitting in on blues harp\, during the induction ceremony for Little Walter into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame on March 10\, 2008. "My Babe" was sung by Robert Britton Lyons\, portraying Carl Perkins\, in medley with "Sixteen Tons" sung by Lance Guest\, portraying Johnny Cash\, in the Broadway musical "Million Dollar Quartet\," which opened in New York in April\, 2010. Lyons and Guest also covered the songs on the "Million Dollar Quartet" original Broadway cast recording\, copyright 2010 by MDQ Merchandising\, LLC."	0

Gómez emigrated with his family from Puerto Rico at a young age to New York\, where he was raised. He started on double bass in the New York City school system at the age of eleven and at age thirteen went to the New York City High School of Music and Art. He played in the Newport Festival Youth Band (led by Marshall Brown) from 1959 to 1961\, and graduated from Juilliard in 1963.  His résumé includes performances with jazz giants such as Miles Davis\, Dizzy Gillespie\, Gerry Mulligan\, John Coltrane\,Benny Goodman\, Buck Clayton\, Ahmad Jamal\, Bill Bruford\, Scott LaFaro\, Marian McPartland\, Paul Bley\, Michael Brecker\, Wayne Shorter\, Steps Ahead\, Steve Gadd\, Ron Carter\, Jeremy Steig\, Herbie Hancock\, Tony Williams\, Al Foster\, Chick Corea\, Eugenio Toussaint and Carli Muñoz. Time lauded: "Eddie Gómez has the world on his strings". He spent a total of eleven years with the Bill Evans Trio\, which included performances throughout the United States\, Europe\, and Asia\, as well as dozens of recordings. Two of the Trio's recordings won Grammy awards. In addition\, he was a member of the Manhattan Jazz Quintet. His career mainly consists of working as an accompanist\, a position suited for his quick reflexes and flexibility.

While its instrumental version is simply known as "The Godfather Love Theme"\, "Speak Softly Love" is the vocal version. The words are by Larry Kusik but the music itself is by Nino Rota. The signature musical theme that opens the piece closely models a theme that appears early in "Preludio - Povero Ernesto!" in the opera Don Pasquale by Gaetano Donizetti (1797-1848). A similar melody also appears in the Overture to "La Forza del Destino" by Giuseppe Verdi (1813-1901). There are also different sets of lyrics for the song in Italian ("Parla Più Piano") and also in Sicilian ("Brucia La Terra"). The Sicilian version is sung by Anthony Corleone (Franc D'Ambrosio) in The Godfather Part III.  Rota had used a more comedic version of the song for the 1958 film Fortunella. When this was discovered\, Rota's score for The Godfather was disqualified from consideration at the 1973 Academy Awards; it had been nominated for Best Original Score. However\, Rota's score for The Godfather Part II won the 1974 Academy Award for Best Original Score\, despite containing the same piece.  Recordings  The song was originally recorded by Andy Williams. Other artists\, such as Al Martino\, Eric Clapton and Bobby Vinton\, have also recorded the song\, among many others:  Slash regularly performs it in concerts in a rock style. Ken Boothe recorded a reggae version. Sergio Franchi recorded the theme song his 1976 DynaHouse album 20 Magnificent Songs. Satan's Pilgrims have performed a surf version as well. Harry Connick Jr. recorded it under the title "Parle Plus Bas". Gianni Morandi had covered the song under the title "Parla Più Piano". Dalida\, Tino Rossi\, Marie Laforêt\, and the Puppini Sisters covered the song under the title "Parle Plus Bas". A Ukrainian version\, "Say You Love Me" (Ukrainian: Скажи\, що любиш; Skazhy scho lyubysh) was performed by Sofia Rotaru in the musical film Song Is Always with Us. The Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra has also performed a ska version of the song. The song was also sampled for a song\, "Raja ko rani se pyar ho gaya" in the Indian film Akele Hum Akele Tum. In Yugoslavia it was adapted and sung by Tereza Kesovija as "Govori Tiše". Hungarian pop star György Korda released the Hungarian language version 1974 as "Gyöngéden ölelj át és ringass szerelem". Candies performed this song live in Osaka in 1977. Fantômas also recorded a metal version of the song on their album The Director's Cut. The Hot Club of Detroit recorded a Gypsy jazz cover of this song on their eponymous album. The Sicilian version from The Godfather Part III appears on the music compilation Mob Hits: the Best Songs of Mafia Movies. Speak Softly Love\, recorded in 2004 by the Norwegian singer Rein Alexander. The melody was used as the theme music and as a central plot device in the Soviet short animated film Contact. A Slovak version was done by František Krištof Veselý\, and a Czech version by Jiří Malásek. Scott Walker recorded a version for his 1972 album The Moviegoer. A Portuguese version called "Fale Baixinho" was recorded by Brazilian singer Wanderley Cardoso in 1972. German jazz pianist Wolfgang Liebert regularly performs it as a standard. Hip-hop artist RZA of Wu-Tang Clan samples the theme in "Black Mozart" on Raekwon's album Only Built 4 Cuban Linx II. The Italian version ("Parla Piu Piano"\, or "Io e Te") was recorded by Johnny Dorelli in 1973 . Dominic Chianese\, who portrayed Johnny Ola in The Godfather Part II\, recorded the Italian version for his album Ungrateful Heart. Mac Dre sampled the theme in his hip-hop song "Mafioso" from his 2003 album\, Al Boo Boo. Parle Plus Bas\, recorded in 2008 by French singer Patrick Fiori for his album Les Choses de La Vie. Rosenberg Trio recorded a version of this song on their 1992 album\, Impressions. The song was covered by several Hong Kong singers\, Frances Yip (葉麗儀) in 1972\, Irene Ryder (黎愛蓮) in 1973\, Juliana Luok (陸小雅) on her LP album Killing Me Softly\, and also\, by Singaporean singer Ling Ying (林櫻) on her LP album The Best Of Lin Ying & The Prinstar Punchers in 1972.	0

COL title VAL Harper Valley P.T.A. COL performer VAL Marlene Beaudry	COL video title VAL Billy Eckstine -- If Ever I Would Leave You COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Billy Eckstine (Pittsburgh\, 8 de julio de 1914 - Pittsburgh\, 8 de marzo de 1993) fue un cantante estadounidense de jazz y música pop. Poseedor de una voz de barítono\, fue durante los años cuarenta una figura carismática de la música popular negra\, al liderar una de las primeras big band de bop y convertirse en el primer cantante negro de baladas románticas (fue llamado el Sinatra negro). Con el paso de los años\, su influencia ha sido considerable en el ámbito del soul y el rhythm and blues.  Eckstine comenzó a cantar a los nueve años y participó en numerosos espectáculos para aficionados. Aunque su vocación había sido la de jugador de fútbol americano\, una grave lesión lo recondujo hacia el mundo de la música. Tras diversos trabajos al oeste de Chicago a finales de los años treinta\, Eckstine fue invitado por Earl Hines para unirse a su Grand Terrace Orchestra en 1939.  Aunque sus primeros éxitos fueron canciones triviales como "Jelly\, Jelly" y "The Jitney Man"\, grabó también varios estándares como "Stormy Monday". Hacia 1943\, se acompañaba de estrellas como Dizzy Gillespie\, Charlie Parker y Sarah Vaughan. Tras formar su propia banda ese año\, contrató a los tres y gradualmente se hizo con más figuras modernas y con futuras estrellas: Wardell Gray\, Dexter Gordon\, Miles Davis\, Kenny Dorham\, Fats Navarro y Art Blakey\, así como con arreglistas como Tadd Dameron y Gil Fuller. La Billy Eckstine Orchestra fue la primera big band bop\, y su líder reflejaba las innovaciones bop adaptando sus armonías vocales a las baladas normales. A pesar del matiz moderno del grupo\, Eckstine encabezó las listas frecuentemente a mediados de los cuarenta\, con temas como "A Cottage for Sale" y "Prisoner of Love". En las giras por Europa y América\, el cantante tocaba también la trompeta\, el trombón de válvulas y la guitarra.  Forzado a disolver la orquesta en 1947 tras haber formado la suya propia Gillespie\, Eckstine realizó una transición hacia un estilo más baladístico y con arreglos de cuerda. Grabó más de una docena de éxitos a finales de los cuarenta\, entre lo que se incluyen "My Foolish Heart" y "I Apologize". Se hizo popular en Gran Bretaña\, obteniendo un gran éxito durante los cincuenta con temas como "No One But You" y "Gigi"\, así como con sus dúos con Sarah Vaughan. Eckstine regresaría a sus raíces jazzísticas ocasionalmente\, grabando con Vaughan\, Count Basie y Quincy Jones\, y grabando un LP en directo\, No Cover\, No Minimum\, en el que interpretaba algunos solos de trompeta. Grabó varios discos para Mercury y Roulette a comienzos de los sesenta y publicó en Motown algunos discos de estándares a mediados de esa década. Tras grabar muy espaciadamente en los setenta\, Eckstine hizo su última grabación (Billy Eckstine Sings with Benny Carter) en 1986. Murió por un ataque al corazón en 1993.

This is a pretty good cover\, and Gary Numan actually sings at times during this song.  Enjoy.)  Lyrics below - It's cold outside And the paint's peeling off of my walls There's a man outside In a long coat\, grey hat\, smoking a cigarette  Now the light fades out And I wonder what I'm doing in a room like this There's a knock on the door And just for a second I thought I remembered you  So now I'm alone Now I can think for myself About little deals And S.U's And things that I just don't understand A white lie that night Or a sly touch at times I don't think it meant anything to you  So I open the door It's the 'friend' that I'd left in the hallway 'Please sit down' A candle lit shadow on a wall near the bed  You know I hate to ask But are 'friends' electric ? Only mine's broke down And now I've no-one to love  So I find out your reason For the phone calls and smiles And it hurts And I'm lonely And I should never have tried And I missed you tonight It must be time to leave You see it meant everything to me	0

It became very popular in the 1960s and many singers and bands from all over the world made their own version of the song often in their own language. The song became even more popular worldwide once it was chosen to be the theme of Top Secret\, a 1960s TV series. Even the Skatalites and Alberto Cortez did their own version of the song. Eddy Helder known by the stage name Ping Pong or Ping Ping is a singer born in 1923 in Suriname\, at the time Dutch Guyana. He is known for being the first to interpret the Sucu sucu song in 1960\, composed by Tarateño Rojas. (From Wikipedia)	0

COPYRIGHTS RESERVED BY COPYRIGHT OWNER.This video is used only for non-profit usage and publishing. Gerard de Vries (Hilversum\, 19 augustus 1933) is een Nederlands zanger en diskjockey.Gerard de Vries is vooral bekend om zijn parlando-muziek\, waarin hij in de jaren zestig van de 20e eeuw enkele grote hits scoorde. Bekende hits van hem zijn Het spel kaarten uit 1965 en Giddy up go uit 1966. Veel van zijn nummers hebben het leven als vrachtwagenchauffeur  als onderwerp. Onder meer Giddy up go en Teddybeer zijn hier voorbeelden van. Vaak zijn deze nummers vertalingen van de populaire Amerikaanse zanger Red Sovine. Opvallend is dat de vertaalde nummers van De Vries niet rijmen\, terwijl die van Sovine dat wel doen. De hits over het leven als vrachtwagenchauffeur zijn in de regel verhalend. De nummers van De Vries hebben vaak een moraliserende ondertoon.Radio Veronica-medewerkers en diskjockeys Ad Bouman\, Hans Mondt\, Tom Collins\, Gerard de Vries en Klaas Vaak namen begin 1970 onder de naam De Binkies de carnavalshit  "Met carnaval" op. Het reikt niet verder dan de Tipparade.Naast zanger was Gerard de Vries diskjockey. Hij presenteerde aanvankelijk bij Radio Veronica onder het pseudoniem  Cowboy Gerard en later bij de TROS onder eigen naam. Gerard de Vries baarde opzien door als eerste diskjockey openlijk voor zijn homoseksualiteit uit te komen. In 1972 praatte hij over Les Cranes Engelse tekst heen op diens single "Desiderata". Het werd de B-kant van de in Nederland uitgebrachte single. Op dit moment is Gerard de Vries actief bij de lokale omroep in Wijdemeren\, Radio Wijdemeren.Na zijn carrière als zanger en diskjockey werd Gerard de Vries ondernemer in de paranormale branche.In 2007 was De Vries kort te zien in het 'datingspektakel' van (de Nederlandse versie van) het televisieprogramma Man bijt hond; hij had gereageerd op een oproep van kandidaat 'Gijs'\, die een man zocht. De Vries bood Gijs een zelfgeschreven boekje aan met de titel De Nederlandse taal.	0

COL title VAL Hazy Shade of Winter COL performer VAL She Wants Revenge	COL video title VAL Nat Kendrick and The Swans - (Do The) Mashed Potatoes COL channel name VAL John1948NineD COL description VAL "(Do the) Mashed Potatoes" is a rhythm and blues instrumental. It was recorded by James Brown with his band in 1959 and released as a two-part single in 1960. For contractual reasons the recording was credited to "Nat Kendrick and the Swans."  The recording of "(Do the) Mashed Potatoes" arose out of James Brown's success in using the Mashed Potato dance as part of his stage show. Brown wanted to record a Mashed Potatoes-themed instrumental with his band in order to capitalize on the dance's popularity. However\, King Records head Syd Nathan\, a frequent critic of Brown's proposals\, would not allow it. (The first instrumental recorded by Brown and his band\, titled "Doodle Bug" and credited to Brown's tenor saxophonist J.C. Davis\, had not sold well when it was released on King's sister label Federal Records.) Brown approached Henry Stone\, a friend in the music business who ran the Dade Records label\, about recording the piece with him. Stone\, although nervous about crossing Nathan (with whom he did business)\, arranged for Brown to record at his Miami studio.  "(Do the) Mashed Potatoes" was recorded with Brown playing the piano and shouting the song's title. To prevent Brown's voice from being recognized\, Stone overdubbed shouted vocals by Carlton "King" Coleman\, a local radio DJ\, onto the recording\, though Brown's voice remains audible in the background. Leadership of the band was officially credited to Nat Kendrick\, who was Brown's drummer at the time\, while the writing was credited to "Dessie Rozier"\, a pseudonym for Brown. A simple twelve bar blues tune\, "(Do the) Mashed Potatoes" became a Top Ten R&B hit in 1960 and fed what would eventually grow into a national dance craze. The band recorded several more singles under the Nat Kendrick & the Swans name\, including "Dish Rag"\, "Slow Down"\, and "Wobble Wobble"\, but none were successful. Eventually made aware of Brown's outside success\, Syd Nathan relented and allowed him to release future instrumentals on King\, starting with the 1961 single "Hold It" b/w "The Scratch".  James Brown had a second Mashed Potatoes-themed hit with "Mashed Potatoes U.S.A." in 1962.  Personnel: "Nat Kendrick & The Swans": Carlton "King" Coleman - lead vocal Alfred Corley - alto saxophone J.C. Davis - tenor saxophone James Brown - piano\, vocal yelps Bobby Roach - guitar Bernard Odum - bass Nat Kendrick - drums  SOURCE: Wikipedia  PLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels\, Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

The song became even more popular worldwide once it was chosen to be the theme of Top Secret\, a 1960s TV series. Even the Skatalites and Alberto Cortez did their own version of the song. Eddy Helder known by the stage name Ping Pong or Ping Ping is a singer born in 1923 in Suriname\, at the time Dutch Guyana.

Il faisait la guerre avec ses amis Dedans la fumée\, Dedans les métros\, Dedans les pavés\, Dedans les bistrots. Il ne savait pas qu'il en était saoûl. Il ne savait pas qu'il dormait debout. Paris le tenait par la peau du cou.  {Refrain:} Ah ! Les pommiers doux\, Rondes et ritournelles. J'ai pas peur des loups\, Chantonnait la belle. Ils ne sont pas méchants Avec les enfants Qu'ont le cœur fidèle Et les genoux blancs...  Sous un pommier doux\, il l'a retrouvée\, Croisant le soleil avec la rosée. Vivent les chansons pour les Bien-aimées. Je me souviens d'elle au sang de velours. Elle avait des mains qui parlaient d'amour Et tressait l'argile avec les nuages Et pressait le vent contre son visage Pour en exprimer l'huile des voyages.  {Refrain}  "Adieu mon Paris"\, dit le chevalier. "J'ai dormi cent ans\, debout sans manger Les pommes d'argent de mes doux pommiers." Alors le village a crié si fort Que toutes les filles ont couru dehors Mais le chevalier n'a salué qu'elle Au sang de velours\, au cœur tant fidèle\, Chevalier fera la guerre en dentelles.  {Refrain}	0

Where is the path to Wonderland? Over the hill or here or there? I wonder where.  *Thanks for watching!*	0

Elles viennent ce jour-là: 'Quand il me prend dans ses bras\, je vois les choses en rose'. Marianne Michel corrige: 'Je vois la vie en rose'.  Marguerite Monnot traite les paroles de "niaiseries". Marianne Michel prend néanmoins et lance la chanson que Piaf reprendra deux ans plus tard." (Gilles Costaz\, "Edith Piaf\, une femme faite cri")  Quand il me prend dans ses bras\, il me parle tout bas\, je vois la vie en rose. Il me dit des mots d’amour\, les mots de tous les jours\, et ça m'fait quelque chose. Il est entré dans mon coeur\, une part de bonheur\, dont je connais la cause. C'est lui pour moi\, moi pour lui dans la vie. Il me l'a dit\, l'a juré\, pour la vie. Et dès que je l’aperçois\, alors je sens en moi mon coeur qui bat.  Des nuits d'amour à en mourir\, un grand bonheur qui prend sa place\, les ennuis\, les chagrins s’effacent\, heureux\, heureux pour mon plaisir. …. Tu me parles tout bas\, je vois la vie en rose. …. Ce sont des mots d’amour et ça m'fait quelque chose Il est entré dans mon coeur\, une part de bonheur\, dont je connais la cause. C'est lui pour moi\, moi pour lui dans la vie. Il me l'a dit\, l'a juré\, pour la vie. Et dès que je l’aperçois\, alors je sens en moi mon coeur qui bat. La\, la la\, ... mon coeur qui bat.	0

I think you only live to see the lights of town. I wasted my time when I would try\, try\, try. When the lights have lost their glow\, you're gonna cry\, cry\, cry.  Soon your sugar-daddies will all be gone. You'll wake up some cold day and find you're alone. You'll call to me but I'm gonna tell you: "Bye\, bye\, bye\," When I turn around and walk away\, you'll cry\, cry\, cry.  I lie awake at night and wait 'til you come in. You stay a little while and then you're gone again. Every question that I ask\, I get a lie\, lie\, lie. For every lie you tell\, you're gonna cry\, cry\, cry.   When your fickle little love gets old\, no one will care for you. You'll come back to me for a little love that's true. I'll tell you no and you gonna ask me why\, why\, why? When I remind you of all of this\, you'll cry\, cry\, cry.  You're gonna cry\, cry\, cry and you'll want me there\, It'll hurt when you think of the fool you've been. You're gonna cry\, cry\, cry.  You're gonna cry\, cry\, cry and you'll cry alone\, When everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own. You're gonna cry\, cry\, cry.	0

Sehorn\, Wilbert Harrison  Recorded at Reflection Sound Studio\, Charlotte\, N.C.  Remixed at Select Sound Studios  ------------------------  "My Babe" is a blues song and a blues standard written by Willie Dixon for Little Walter. Released in 1955 on Checker Records\, a subsidiary of Chess Records\, the song was the only Dixon composition ever to become a no. 1 R&B single\, and it was one of the biggest hits of either of their careers.   The song was based on the traditional gospel song "This Train (Is Bound For Glory)"\, which Sister Rosetta Tharpe recorded in the 1939 hit\, "This Train". Dixon reworked the arrangement and lyrics from the sacred\, the procession of saints into Heaven\, into the secular\, a story about a woman that won't stand for her man to cheat: "My baby\, she don't stand no cheating\, my babe\, she don't stand none of that midnight creeping".  Ray Charles had famously\, and controversially\, pioneered the gospel-song-to-secular-song approach with his reworking of the gospel hymn "It Must Be Jesus." into "I Got a Woman"\, which hit the Billboard R&B charts on January 22\, 1955\, later climbing to the #1 position for one week. Within days of the appearance of Charles's song on the national charts\, Little Walter entered the studio to record "My Babe"\, on January 25\, 1955. "My Babe" was released while "I've Got A Woman" was still on the charts\, and eclipsed Charles's record by spending 19 weeks on the Billboard R&B charts beginning on March 12\, 1955\, including five weeks at the number one position\, making it one of the biggest R&B hits of 1955.  The "B" side of "My Babe" was the harmonica instrumental "Thunderbird"\, following the pattern established by the release of Little Walter's number #1 hit single from 1952\, "Juke"\, of featuring a vocal performance one side and a harmonica instrumental on the flip side.  Recording  Although no documentation exists\, the song was probably recorded at Universal Recorders in Chicago\, the site of the majority of Chess and Checker sessions until Chess opened their own studio c. 1956/'57. Backing Little Walter's vocals and harmonica were Robert Lockwood\, Jr. and Leonard Caston on guitars\, Willie Dixon on double-bass\, and Fred Below on drums.  Guitarist Luther Tucker\, then a member of Walter's band\, was absent from the recording session that day. "My Babe" was re-issued in 1961 with an overdubbed female vocal backing chorus and briefly crossed over to the pop charts.   Cover Versions  The success of song lead to dozens of cover versions by many diverse artists: Elvis Presley released a live cover on the album From Memphis to Vegas/From Vegas to Memphis Dale Hawkins released "My Babe" as a single by Checker Records Chuck Berry covered the song on Chuck Berry in 1975 The song was performed by Little Walter\, Bo Diddley\, and Muddy Waters on Super Blues Sonny Burgess and the Pacers on their self-titled album Cliff Richard on Cliff Ricky Nelson on his 1958 album Ricky Nelson Peter & Gordon on In Touch With... Donald Byrd on Up with Donald Byrd Ronnie Milsap on Just for a Thrill Conway Twitty\, Ramsey Lewis\, Grant Green\, Mississippi Fred McDowell\, Coleman Hawkins\, Gene Ammons\, The Everly Brothers\, The Animals\,the Steve Miller Band\, Lou Rawls\, Ike & Tina Turner\, and many others have also covered the song. Mose Allison rewrote it as "My Brain" and recorded it for his 2010 album "The Way of the World". The song "My Babe" by the Spencer Davis Group (Stevie Winwood) on their first album is a different song. "My Babe" was performed by Ben Harper\, with James Cotton sitting in on blues harp\, during the induction ceremony for Little Walter into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame on March 10\, 2008. "My Babe" was sung by Robert Britton Lyons\, portraying Carl Perkins\, in medley with "Sixteen Tons" sung by Lance Guest\, portraying Johnny Cash\, in the Broadway musical "Million Dollar Quartet\," which opened in New York in April\, 2010. Lyons and Guest also covered the songs on the "Million Dollar Quartet" original Broadway cast recording\, copyright 2010 by MDQ Merchandising\, LLC."	1

COL title VAL The Hunter COL performer VAL Albert King	COL video title VAL Roaring 20s: Leona Williams & Her Dixie Band - I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate\,     1922 COL channel name VAL 240252 COL description VAL I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate -- Leona Williams & Her Dixie Band\, Columbia 1922 (USA; accoustical recording)  NOTE: "I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate"; often simply "Sister Kate"\, is a jazz dance song\, written by Clarence Williams and Armand Piron\, and published in 1919.  The lyrics of the song are narrated first person by Kate's sister\, who sings about Kate's impressive dancing skill and her wish to be able to emulate it. She laments that she's not quite "up to date"\, but believes that dancing like "Sister Kate" will rectify this\, and she will be able to impress "all the boys in the neighborhood" like her sister.    The dance of "shmmy" was named after one of the belly-dance figures and was one of many manifestations of the increasing public interest in the Orient and the Oriental culture -- evoked by many factors\, like the archeological excavations in  Egypt as well as post-WW1 technological revolution  (esp.-- the long-distance plane flightsor the cruise-liner trips) which enabled  middle class people to take part in the modern style tourist journeys across the wast and formerly unattainable territories. However\, still exists another version of the birth of that strange word: according to one artristic legend\, it was a Polish dancer from  Cracow\, Marianna Michalska -- better known as "Gilda Grey" - who\, in her early days in America  and before her show\, where she was supposed to present the new  dance hit of the year 1918  -- said to her dresser in her broken English: - Gimmie'dat'shmisee (chemise).   Whatever did Gilda Grey really say - and in whatever chemise she made her first shimmy-steps on stage -- the new dance-trot in short time conquered dance floors all over the world. It is very difficult to describe\, in short terms\, what was the choreographic clue to a shimmy- my aunt\, who  in my famile carried a deserved title of a "ballroom queen" would once present it to me when I was a kid\, and I saw nothing but series of  con vulsive jigs\, jerks and belly shakes which rather unpleasantly contrasted with what I considered as a sensuous logic of the waltz\, of tango or even -- of the charleston (which came several years later\, in 1924).   In Poland\, shimmy was made popular by the Warsaw operette diva Lucyna Messal\, who presented it at the Polish premiere of Emmerich Kalman's operette "Bayadera". in 1923. E.Kalman's hit "Każda piękność tańczy shimmy" (Ev'ry Beauty Dances Shimmy)   became one of the international evergreens and is still considered as the key shimmy-tune in the history of the lighter music in Europe. In YT are available several excellent modern renditions of that Kalman's song\, from among which the most instructive and presented in a breathtaking & hot manner is a presentation by young Hungarian dancers http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUJMBAEfo-g  Also\, very picturesque is Russian version entitled  "Ah Mademoiselle\, stan'tsueem shimmy?" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl06NffV3b0 or amusing presentation by the Italian Operette artists\, under the title "Signorina vuol ballare lo shimmy ?" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvS2ZNFGDe0   In USA\, where Kalman's operetta has never been such a hit like in Europe\, the key shimmy tune has always been the Clarence William's/Piron jazzy tune "I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate". Also\, very popular was Spencer William's tune "Shimme-Sha-Wabble" http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xiypoj_red-nichols-his-5-pennies-shim-me-sha-wabble-1930_music#.Ud8RAJH5v0Q .

The lyrics of the song are narrated first person by Kate's sister\, who sings about Kate's impressive dancing skill and her wish to be able to emulate it. She laments that she's not quite "up to date"\, but believes that dancing like "Sister Kate" will rectify this\, and she will be able to impress "all the boys in the neighborhood" like her sister.    The dance of "shmmy" was named after one of the belly-dance figures and was one of many manifestations of the increasing public interest in the Orient and the Oriental culture -- evoked by many factors\, like the archeological excavations in  Egypt as well as post-WW1 technological revolution  (esp.-- the long-distance plane flightsor the cruise-liner trips) which enabled  middle class people to take part in the modern style tourist journeys across the wast and formerly unattainable territories. However\, still exists another version of the birth of that strange word: according to one artristic legend\, it was a Polish dancer from  Cracow\, Marianna Michalska -- better known as "Gilda Grey" - who\, in her early days in America  and before her show\, where she was supposed to present the new  dance hit of the year 1918  -- said to her dresser in her broken English: - Gimmie'dat'shmisee (chemise).   Whatever did Gilda Grey really say - and in whatever chemise she made her first shimmy-steps on stage -- the new dance-trot in short time conquered dance floors all over the world. It is very difficult to describe\, in short terms\, what was the choreographic clue to a shimmy- my aunt\, who  in my famile carried a deserved title of a "ballroom queen" would once present it to me when I was a kid\, and I saw nothing but series of  con vulsive jigs\, jerks and belly shakes which rather unpleasantly contrasted with what I considered as a sensuous logic of the waltz\, of tango or even -- of the charleston (which came several years later\, in 1924).   In Poland\, shimmy was made popular by the Warsaw operette diva Lucyna Messal\, who presented it at the Polish premiere of Emmerich Kalman's operette "Bayadera". in 1923. E.Kalman's hit "Każda piękność tańczy shimmy" (Ev'ry Beauty Dances Shimmy)   became one of the international evergreens and is still considered as the key shimmy-tune in the history of the lighter music in Europe. In YT are available several excellent modern renditions of that Kalman's song\, from among which the most instructive and presented in a breathtaking & hot manner is a presentation by young Hungarian dancers http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUJMBAEfo-g  Also\, very picturesque is Russian version entitled  "Ah Mademoiselle\, stan'tsueem shimmy?" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl06NffV3b0 or amusing presentation by the Italian Operette artists\, under the title "Signorina vuol ballare lo shimmy ?" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvS2ZNFGDe0   In USA\, where Kalman's operetta has never been such a hit like in Europe\, the key shimmy tune has always been the Clarence William's/Piron jazzy tune "I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate". Also\, very popular was Spencer William's tune "Shimme-Sha-Wabble" http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xiypoj_red-nichols-his-5-pennies-shim-me-sha-wabble-1930_music#.Ud8RAJH5v0Q .

I'll never get over losing you But I've had to learn that life goes on And the memories grow dim like a half forgotten song 'Til the blackberry winter reminds me you are gone.  And I get so lonely\, most of all in springtime I wish I could enjoy the first of May But I know it means that blackberry winter Is not too far away.	0

COL title VAL Please Don't Touch COL performer VAL Motörhead - Girlschool	COL video title VAL JOHNNY MATHIS sweet Lorraine (1958) COL channel name VAL OubaelPhoumet COL description VAL album : Swing softly  Johnny Mathis may swing softly\, but he does swing. This 1958 album features upbeat interpretations of pop standards like "You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To" and "I've Got the World on a String" performed with Percy Faith and his orchestra. Close listeners will appreciate the purity of Mathis' vocal technique\, which differs markedly from that of later singers for its infrequent use of modulation. Mathis was an album artist\, as Swing Softly -- a hit album without a hit single -- proves. Although he is known for his sensitive balladry\, Mathis swings with ease on these 12 favorites and offers something a little bit different from his previous albums.	0

"A Lover's Question" has been recorded by many artists including Otis Redding and Del Reeves\, but was originally a hit for Clyde McPhatter in 1958 on Atlantic Records. The song was written by Brook Benton and Jimmy T. Williams and was Clyde McPhatter's most successful release\, reaching number six on the Billboard Hot 100\, and number one on the R&B chart for one week.  According to an issue of Jet magazine from February 1961\, the finger snapping you hear in Ernestine Anderson's version of the song\, was done by Brook Benton himself\, who happened to be in the studio when it was recorded.  The inimitable Ernestine Anderson is a world-class jazz singer who started her career in the late 1940s. Her debut album\, "Hot Cargo" was released by Mercury in 1956. Her best known club classic is the 1960s Bossa Nova tinged "Keep An Eye On Love".  Listen to "That's All I Want From You" here: http://youtu.be/WIv6X53v6N0	0

COL title VAL The Trolley Song COL performer VAL Vaughn Monroe and Marilyn Duke	COL video title VAL Bob Wills - Steel Guitar Rag 1936 COL channel name VAL preservationhall01 COL description VAL Bob Wills was born in Kosse\, Texas in 1905.   In 1929 he started the Wills Fiddle Boys in Ft. Worth\, then came to the attention of perennial Texas Gubernatorial candidate Pappy Lee O'Daniel who ran the Light Crust Flour Mills in Saginaw\, Texas just north of Ft. Worth.  Wills lept to fame playing as the Light Crust Doughboys but after several years the band tired of the gig as they were also expected to load flour trucks during the day.  In '34 the band moved to Tulsa to get away from Pappy Lee and formed the Texas Playboys.  They invented western music with a jazz beat known as Western Swing.  Some of his music was dead-on jazz while other songs were straight western-his genre was hard to pin down.  On clear channel 50\,000 watt KVOO in Tulsa The Playboys broadcast from Cain's Ballroom on North Main and they played it all. In 1968 Wills was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame as the King of Western Swing- and as Willie Nelson crooned-he's still the King.  Wills died in  Ft Worth\, Texas in 1975. Leon McAuliffe\, his steel guitar player featured on this record\, was born in Houston\, Texas in 1917.  He played with Bob Wills band until WWII and after the war formed his own group in Tulsa. Steel Guitar Rag was recorded in Chicago at the Furniture Mart Building\, 666 Lakeshore Drive on September 29\, 1936 on the Vocalion and Okeh subsidiary labels of Columbia.	0

COL channel name VAL CrisVangel1958 COL description VAL Elmer's Tune - The Charioteers (Okeh Records) 1947\, 78 rpm!  A Direct Recording!  Led by the awesomely talented tenor Billy Williams\, the Charioteers were the most gospel-sounding of the great black pop vocal groups of the '40s\, a sound that did not translate into the record sales that Columbia record execs—eager for an answer to Decca's Ink Spots—were hoping for. But to ears educated by the doo wop and soul groups to come\, this group's stuff is mighty fine\, definitely vocal pop but hinting of the left turn towards R&B that vocal music was soon to take in the '50s.	0

It is related to a group of early 20th century blues and work songs that include "I'm Alabama Bound"\, "Another Man Done Gone"\, and "Don't Leave Me Here"\, and "Turn Your Lamp Down Low". It has become a blues and rock standard\, and has been recorded by many artists.  The original 1935 single by Joe Williams' Washboard Blues Singers can be heard on Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music\, Vol. 4 (Revenant\, 2000).  Notable cover versions  Van Morrison and Them  The band Them\, fronted by Van Morrison\, released "Baby\, Please Don't Go" as the A side of a single in late 1964. Boosted by the B side\, a ditty entitled "Gloria"\, the single became their first hit\, reaching No. 10 on the UK Singles Chart. Rhythm guitar was contributed by a then little-known Jimmy Page\, however he did not play the lead guitar on the track. It was re-released on the Deram label in 1973.  John Lee Hooker's posthumously released DVD Come See About Me includes a 1992 performance where Hooker plays "Baby\, Please Don't Go" on his guitar while sitting on a dock. He is accompanied on harmonica by Them's Van Morrison.  Amboy Dukes / Ted Nugent  Since it was The Amboy Dukes' debut single\, former Dukes guitarist Ted Nugent has covered the song in live performances throughout his career. The single is included on the 1967 album The Amboy Dukes.  AC/DC recorded a version for their 1975 Australia-only album High Voltage; it was released internationally in 1984 on their compilation EP '74 Jailbreak.  Aerosmith released a version of "Baby\, Please Don't Go" on their blues cover album\, Honkin' on Bobo in 2004.

Join our Youtube: https://goo.gl/8AOGaN Join our Facebook: http://goo.gl/5oL723 Charles Edward Anderson "Chuck" Berry (born October 18\, 1926) is an American guitarist\, singer and songwriter and is one of the pioneers of rock and roll music. With songs such as "Maybellene" (1955)\, "Roll Over Beethoven" (1956)\, "Rock and Roll Music" (1957) and "Johnny B. Goode" (1958)\, Berry refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive\, with lyrics focusing on teen life and consumerism and music featuring guitar solos and showmanship that were a major influence on subsequent rock music. Born into a middle-class African-American family in St. Louis\, Missouri\, Berry had an interest in music from an early age and gave his first public performance at Sumner High School. While still a high-school student he was convicted of armed robbery and was sent to a reformatory\, where he was held from 1944 to 1947. After his release\, Berry settled into married life and worked at an automobile assembly plant. By early 1953\, influenced by the guitar riffs and showmanship techniques of the blues musician T-Bone Walker\, Berry began performing with the Johnnie Johnson Trio. His break came when he traveled to Chicago in May 1955 and met Muddy Waters\, who suggested he contact Leonard Chess\, of Chess Records. With Chess he recorded "Maybellene"—Berry's adaptation of the country song "Ida Red"—which sold over a million copies\, reaching number one on Billboard magazine's rhythm and blues chart. By the end of the 1950s\, Berry was an established star with several hit records and film appearances and a lucrative touring career. He had also established his own St. Louis nightclub\, Berry's Club Bandstand. But in January 1962\, he was sentenced to three years in prison for offenses under the Mann Act—he had transported a 14-year-old girl across state lines.

Tell me baby\, do you recognize me? Well\, it's been a year\, it doesn't surprise me. Merry Christmas\, I wrapped it up and sent it With a note saying 'I love you;' I meant it. Now I know what a fool I've been But if you kiss me now\, I know you'd fool me again.  //Last Christmas I gave you my heart But the very next day\, you gave it away This year\, to save me from tears I'll give it to someone special//  A crowded room\, friends with tired eyes I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice. My God\, I thought you were someone to rely on. Me\, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on. A face on a lover with a fire in his heart A man undercover but you tore me apart Now I've found a real love You'll never fool me again.  ///Last Christmas I gave you my heart But the very next day\, you gave it away This year\, to save me from tears I'll give it to someone special///  (In background: A face on a lover with a fire in his heart A man undercover but you tore me apart Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again)	0

There everyone knows old Scott. We hope this record will make him known to a wider audience.  "Scott Dunbar is not an unknown artist struggling for recognition; being one of the most well-known men around Lake Mary has been enough for him. When you listen to this album you will hear a man who has lived a good life and is satisfied with it; his songs are neither a bid for money or fame\, nor mournful cries from a suffering heart. I asked Scott once what his music meant to him\, and he said: Well I'll tell you...if it feels good to the people it feels twice as good to me."	0

COL title VAL What Am I Living For COL performer VAL Tom Jones	COL video title VAL Kenny G - Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas (Arista Records 1994) COL channel name VAL ChristmasTimeTV COL description VAL "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" is a song introduced by Judy Garland in the 1944 MGM musical Meet Me in St. Louis. Frank Sinatra later recorded a version with modified lyrics\, which has become more common than the original. The song was written by Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane.  When presented with the original draft lyric\, Garland\, her co-star Tom Drake and director Vincente Minnelli criticized the song as depressing\, and asked Martin to change the lyrics. Though he initially resisted\, Martin made several changes to make the song more upbeat. For example\, the lines "It may be your last / Next year we may all be living in the past" became "Let your heart be light / Next year all our troubles will be out of sight". Garland's version of the song\, which was also released as a single by Decca Records\, became popular among United States troops serving in World War II; her performance at the Hollywood Canteen brought many soldiers to tears.  In 1957\, Frank Sinatra asked Martin to revise the line "Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow". He told Martin\, "The name of my album is A Jolly Christmas. Do you think you could jolly up that line for me?" Martin's new line was "Hang a shining star upon the highest bough". Martin made several other alterations\, changing the song's focus to a celebration of present happiness\, rather than anticipation of a better future. On The Judy Garland Show Christmas Special\, Judy sings the song to her children Joey and Lorna Luft with Sinatra's alternate lyrics.  Have yourself a merry little Christmas  Let your heart be light  From now on  our troubles will be out of sight  Have yourself a merry little Christmas  Make the Yule-tide gay  From now on  our troubles will be miles away   Here were are as in olden days  happy golden days of yore  Faithful friends who are dear to us  gather near to us once more   Through the years we all will be together  If the Fates allow  Hang a shining star upon the highest bough  And have yourself a merry little Christmas now	0

If you have never been to sunshinetunes67's channel I highly recommend it. You will hear some old songs you cant hear anywhere else. He has an amazing collection of some familiar and some never heard. It was fun for me making this video; I was trying a little animation which requires a lot of images to do. I look at it and think it might be a little hokey but when I see that ball come through the hoop it makes me smile. I sometime like to morph my images one into the next and sometimes I am lazy and use a program that makes the movie for me I just put the images in and choose the style.	0

COL title VAL We Will Rock You COL performer VAL DJ Hurricane	COL video title VAL Besame Mucho by Trio Los Panchos COL channel name VAL gu7196 COL description VAL Music & lyrics written by Consuelo Velasquez of Mexico in 1941. According to Velasquez\, the song was inspired by an aria from an opera by Enrique Granados\, a Spanish composer and pianist of classical music. Played by Trio Los Panchos\, whether this was the first version I'm not sure but I found this version is the best version I've ever heard so far\, particularly their outstanding guitar arrangement.  The lyric goes :  Bésame\, bésame mucho como si fuera esta noche la última vez\, bésame\, bésame mucho que tengo miedo perderte perderte después.  Quiero tenerte muy cerca mirarme en tus ojos y estar junto a ti\, piensa que tal vez mañana estaré muy lejos muy lejos de aquí\,   bésame\, bésame mucho como si fuera esta noche la última vez\, bésame\, bésame mucho que tengo miedo perderte perderte después  Enjoy !	0

I think you only live to see the lights of town. I wasted my time when I would try\, try\, try. When the lights have lost their glow\, you're gonna cry\, cry\, cry.  Soon your sugar-daddies will all be gone. You'll wake up some cold day and find you're alone. You'll call to me but I'm gonna tell you: "Bye\, bye\, bye\," When I turn around and walk away\, you'll cry\, cry\, cry.  I lie awake at night and wait 'til you come in. You stay a little while and then you're gone again. Every question that I ask\, I get a lie\, lie\, lie. For every lie you tell\, you're gonna cry\, cry\, cry.   When your fickle little love gets old\, no one will care for you. You'll come back to me for a little love that's true. I'll tell you no and you gonna ask me why\, why\, why? When I remind you of all of this\, you'll cry\, cry\, cry.  You're gonna cry\, cry\, cry and you'll want me there\, It'll hurt when you think of the fool you've been. You're gonna cry\, cry\, cry.  You're gonna cry\, cry\, cry and you'll cry alone\, When everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own. You're gonna cry\, cry\, cry.	0

COL description VAL Recorded in 1952 with "Heart and Soul" on the flipside. A pair of Philadelphia boys\, Al Alberts and Dave Mahoney\, finding themselves in the North Atlantic in the Navy in WWII\, killed time by singing together. Joining two more local boys\, Rosario and Louis\, they formed the Four Aces\, following in the footsteps of the Ames Brothers. Their first hit was "(It's No) Sin\," which was shopped to no avail to New York record companies\, and finally released by Al\, who started his own record company\, Victoria Records\, to do it. The song peaked on Billboard's charts at #4 in 1951\, and the Aces were quickly signed by Decca. The group-written "Tell Me Why\," "A Garden in the Rain\," "Perfidia\," "I'm Yours" and "Heart and Soul" were next to climb high on the charts. Appearing frequently on TV\, Aces singles "La Rosita\," "Just Squeeze Me\," "Laughing on the Outside" and "The Gang that Sang (Heart of My Heart)" were among 8 of the group's hits in 1952. "Stranger in Paradise" went to #2 on the charts\, which the Aces finally topped with the theme from the movie "Three Coins in a Fountain." Popular hits "Dream" and "So Long\," followed\, and "Mr. Sandman" and "Melody of Love" scored in Billboard's top five before the floodgates of Rock 'n Roll opened in 1955\, and even that year the Aces had another chart-topper with "Love is a Many Splendored Thing."	0

Clover released two country-rock albums before changing their sound to something closer to pub rock\, whereupon Nick Lowe heard them\, really liked them\, and hooked them up with Jake Riviera and Elvis Costello\, which led to several members backing Elvis on My Aim Is True and two excellent albums on the Vertigo label.  However\, what Clover has become most famous for is featuring a lead singer/harmonica player by the name of Huey Lewis\, who of course went on to great fame in the '80s and beyond.  I really love this cover of The Ricky Nelson hit; it shows off just how tight Clover was\, and how amazing their vocals were!	0

Digitally reissued\, and on CD\, on Waiata Vol1: Maori Showbands\, Balladeers and Popstars compilation put together by Grant Gillanders (EMI NZ).The song was originally made famous by Brenton Wood.   Bio from Amplifier.co.nz\, who have two digital albums of nhis recordings available... http://www.amplifier.co.nz/artist/20358/nash-chase.html?full=1   "Born in Taihape\, Nash Chase entered the New Zealand pop scene in 1970 with a top ten single What greater Love which peaked on the national chart at number ten. Nash came from a large family of eighteen brothers and sisters and all were musically inclined so it was no surprise when he decided on a career in entertainment.  In 1971 Nash entered the Studio One TV contest and ended up as winner of the New Faces section\, which resulted in a recording contract with EMI. His first single for the label Today I Killed A Man I Didn't Know became an immediate top twenty hit and was a finalist in the 1971 Loxene Gold Disc Awards.   The follow-up releases If You'd Like To Be A Lady\, Eye For The main Chance\, and Anderson And Wise also became winners with Anderson And Wise reaching the finals of the 1972 Studio One Contest.   With his commercial appeal Nash was always a favourite with radio and his final single release Maria Isabella also became a finalist in the 1973 RATA Awards.   In February 1973 Nash Chase and his wife decided to leave New Zealand for the entertainment circuit in Australia and although EMI there released a selection of singles over the following year he was unable to break into the lucrative Sydney scene."	0

COL title VAL Sisters of Mercy COL performer VAL Judy Collins	COL video title VAL Nat Kendrick and The Swans - (Do The) Mashed Potatoes COL channel name VAL John1948NineD COL description VAL "(Do the) Mashed Potatoes" is a rhythm and blues instrumental. It was recorded by James Brown with his band in 1959 and released as a two-part single in 1960. For contractual reasons the recording was credited to "Nat Kendrick and the Swans."  The recording of "(Do the) Mashed Potatoes" arose out of James Brown's success in using the Mashed Potato dance as part of his stage show. Brown wanted to record a Mashed Potatoes-themed instrumental with his band in order to capitalize on the dance's popularity. However\, King Records head Syd Nathan\, a frequent critic of Brown's proposals\, would not allow it. (The first instrumental recorded by Brown and his band\, titled "Doodle Bug" and credited to Brown's tenor saxophonist J.C. Davis\, had not sold well when it was released on King's sister label Federal Records.) Brown approached Henry Stone\, a friend in the music business who ran the Dade Records label\, about recording the piece with him. Stone\, although nervous about crossing Nathan (with whom he did business)\, arranged for Brown to record at his Miami studio.  "(Do the) Mashed Potatoes" was recorded with Brown playing the piano and shouting the song's title. To prevent Brown's voice from being recognized\, Stone overdubbed shouted vocals by Carlton "King" Coleman\, a local radio DJ\, onto the recording\, though Brown's voice remains audible in the background. Leadership of the band was officially credited to Nat Kendrick\, who was Brown's drummer at the time\, while the writing was credited to "Dessie Rozier"\, a pseudonym for Brown. A simple twelve bar blues tune\, "(Do the) Mashed Potatoes" became a Top Ten R&B hit in 1960 and fed what would eventually grow into a national dance craze. The band recorded several more singles under the Nat Kendrick & the Swans name\, including "Dish Rag"\, "Slow Down"\, and "Wobble Wobble"\, but none were successful. Eventually made aware of Brown's outside success\, Syd Nathan relented and allowed him to release future instrumentals on King\, starting with the 1961 single "Hold It" b/w "The Scratch".  James Brown had a second Mashed Potatoes-themed hit with "Mashed Potatoes U.S.A." in 1962.  Personnel: "Nat Kendrick & The Swans": Carlton "King" Coleman - lead vocal Alfred Corley - alto saxophone J.C. Davis - tenor saxophone James Brown - piano\, vocal yelps Bobby Roach - guitar Bernard Odum - bass Nat Kendrick - drums  SOURCE: Wikipedia  PLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels\, Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

They could never cover up this Dirt Dodgin' Rock 'n' Roll Death Camp survivor. Leslie West loves to laugh at the irony of his perpetuity and the fact that Dodgin' The Dirt might be his finest work. The big man from Mountain has lost weight but the figure he cuts is no less imposing. Leslie has a signature sound. You can hear it in everything he does from "Mississippi Queen" to three cuts on Billy Joel's "River Of Dreams". Dodgin' The Dirt - there's that distinctive tone and violin control vibrato. 'His kind of guitar' is clear focused\, coming from that center inside where talent transcends personality\, time and Long Island.  Tracklist  01. Whiskey Train (Trower/Reid) - 4:23 02.

Clover released two country-rock albums before changing their sound to something closer to pub rock\, whereupon Nick Lowe heard them\, really liked them\, and hooked them up with Jake Riviera and Elvis Costello\, which led to several members backing Elvis on My Aim Is True and two excellent albums on the Vertigo label.  However\, what Clover has become most famous for is featuring a lead singer/harmonica player by the name of Huey Lewis\, who of course went on to great fame in the '80s and beyond.  I really love this cover of The Ricky Nelson hit; it shows off just how tight Clover was\, and how amazing their vocals were!	0

Mildred Bailey (February 27\, 1907 -- December 12\, 1951) was a popular and influential American jazz singer during the 1930s\, known as "The Rockin' Chair Lady" and "Mrs. Swing". Her number one hits were "Please Be Kind"\, "Darn That Dream"\, "Rockin' Chair" and "Says My Heart". In the mid 1930s\, she recorded with her third husband Red Norvo. A dynamic couple\, they earned the nicknames "Mr. and Mrs. Swing". During this period (1936--1939) Norvo recorded for Brunswick (with Bailey as primary vocalist) and Bailey recorded her own set of recordings for Vocalion\, often with Norvo's band. Some of her recordings instead featured members of Count Basie's band. Despite her divorce from Norvo\, she and Red would continue to record together until 1945. Suffering from diabetes and depression (during her adult life Bailey was overweight)\, she only made a few recordings following World War II.  Mildred Bailey died December 12\, 1951\, in Poughkeepsie\, New York\, of heart failure\, aged 44\, chiefly due to her diabetes. Her ashes were scattered. Red Norvo outlived Bailey by nearly half a century\, dying in April 1999\, a week after his 91st birthday. "I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You" is a 1932 song composed by Victor Young\, with lyrics written by Ned Washington and Bing Crosby\, recorded on October 14\, 1932 by Bing Crosby in New York. In 1939\, Mildred Bailey fronted a six-side\, mostly blues session as "Mildred Bailey and her Oxford Greys" for Vocalion\, which featured a small mixed-race combo of Mary Lou Williams (piano)\, Floyd Smith (electric guitar)\, John Williams (bass) and Eddie Dougherty (drums).	0

Producer: Creed Taylor.  Reissue producer: Ben Young.  Recorded at the Van Gelder Studio\, Englewood Cliffs\, New Jersey on July 16\, 1963; Bell Sound Studios\, New York\, New York on July 25\, 1963; A&R Recording\, New York\, New York on July 29\, 1963. Includes liner notes by Michael Ullman and Del Shields.  Digitally remastered using 24-bit technology by Kevin Reeves (Polygram Studios).  This is part of the Verve Master Edition series.  This auspicious recording started out almost as an afterthought. Jimmy Smith was in the midst of making his excellent big-band album ANY NUMBER CAN WIN when he stepped into a couple of New York studios with old pal Kenny Burrell and a rhythm section to quickly cut the sides that became BLUE BASH. The air of spontaneity is certainly present here\, as Burrell and Smith use the common language of the blues to move through a varied program.  An appropriately simmering version of the Peggy Lee hit "Fever" finds Smith at his most sensual. The upbeat\, Burrell-penned "Travelin'" has something of a gospel jubilee feel\, along the lines of "When the Saints Go Marching In\," and Burrell's joyous lines makes the most of the celebratory mood. The standard "Easy Living" finds the fiery Smith in an uncommonly wistful mode\, contributing blissful\, pretty organ runs over Burrell's lush harmonies. The revealing bonus tracks\, almost another album's worth of material\, shed further light on the interaction between the musicians\, revealing both endearing flubs and previously unheard gems.	0

COL title VAL Just a Little Bit COL performer VAL Charlie Musselwhite	COL video title VAL Bessie Smith -- Baby Won't You Please Come Home 1923 COL channel name VAL Henri Erwig COL description VAL Bessie Smith -- Baby Won't You Please Come Home 1923  Bessie Smith (1892 or 1894 --1937) was the most popular and successful female American blues singer of the 1920s and 1930s\, and a strong influence on subsequent generations\, including Billie Holiday\, Mahalia Jackson\, Dinah Washington\, Nina Simone and Janis Joplin. This is one of her first recordings in 1923 with pianist Clarence Williams. In no other way than living the kind of violent\, hard-drinking street life she sang about\, could Bessie Smith have inspired in her audiences the powerful empathy that ultimately won her the title\, "Empress of the Blues." Throughout her career\, Bessie was respected for being a strong\, independent African-American woman with tremendous talent and determination. She expressed great pride in her culture\, and gladly participated in its earthy pleasures\, regularly indulging her taste for alcohol and sex to extremes. How ever much others tried to run roughshod over her\, Bessie refused to submit to the slightest abuse without a knock-down\, drag-out fight. With few exceptions\, she held to her musical ideals with equal tenacity. Though musically illiterate\, she regularly collaborated with her pianists to compose and write down her music and her words frequently touched on pertinent events in her life. Her performance style\, too\, derives considerably from her own personal and cultural attributes. (first posted on ilbofilms feb 24 2008; 492 views)	0

COL title VAL Ah\, Sweet Mystery of Life COL performer VAL Milt Jackson	COL video title VAL To All The Men I've Loved Before - Shirley Bassey (1984 Recording) COL channel name VAL Shirley Bassey Music and Vids COL description VAL 1984/1986 (Here is another mid-1980's single by Shirley Bassey titled\, 'To All The Men I've Loved Before'.  This song was originally written as 'To All The Girls I've Loved Before\, and it was a hit for Julio Iglesias and Willie Nelson.    This song was recorded before digital CD format came into existence\, and because Towerbell Records went out of business\, this song along with all Shirley's 1980's Towerbell recordings are only available via second hand outlets in vinyl format.  It took many attempts to move this track from my record player to a MP3 file trying to obtain the best sound possible\, and I think it plays well.  I kept trying to clean the record to remove the embedded dust\, then it would only play the left side....then it would only play the right side.  Finally....success!   I can't believe that was how we used to listen to music!  ABOUT this song: "To All the Girls I've Loved Before" is a song originally sung by Albert Hammond\, but more famous for a 1984 cover by singers Julio Iglesias and Willie Nelson\, which appeared on Iglesias's album 1100 Bel Air Place. A breakthrough for Iglesias in the English language market\, the song peaked at #5 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #1 on the RPM Top Singles. "To All the Girls I've Loved Before" went to number one on the country chart\, and was one of two entries on the country chart for Julio Iglesias and Willie Nelson as duo (the second was "Spanish Eyes"\, which peaked at #8 in late 1988).  It was Iglesias' biggest hit in the United States and Canada\, and Nelson's biggest European hit. The record also appeared on Australian\, New Zealand and South African charts. The song has become Iglesias's signature English-language tune\, prominently performed at his concerts since the single's release. Thanks to this song\, 1100 Bel Air Place became Iglesias' world-wide best selling album. In 1984\, Nelson and Iglesias were also named "Duo of the year" by the Country Music Association\, and "To All the Girls I've Loved Before" was named single of the year by the Academy of Country Music.  LYRICS: To all the men I've loved before Who travelled in and out my door I'm glad they came along I dedicate this song To all the men I've loved before  To all the men I once caressed And may I say I've held the best For helping me to grow I owe a lot I know To all the men I've loved before  The winds of change are always blowing And every time I try to stay The winds of change continue blowing And they just carry me away  To all the men who shared my life Who wanted me to be their wife I'm glad they came along I dedicate this song To all the men I've loved before  To all the men who cared for me Who filled my nights with ecstasy They live within my heart I'll always be a part Of all the men I've loved before  Special Thanks to Pieter\,  Astrid and others from the Shirley Bassey blog\, Tal from the Diamond Bassey website\, and all those who have contributed wonderful pictures of Shirley!	0

What Really Happened To The Band Of '59 '' Label: Rhino Records -- RNLP 852 Format: Vinyl\, LP\, Album Country: US Released: 1983  Tracklist A1 I Write The Songs A2 Bette Davis Eyes A3 Super Freak A4 Star Wars A5 Whip It A6 Ebony And Ivory B1 You Don't Bring Me Flowers B2 Hit Me With Your Best Shot B3 The Rose B4 Just What I Needed B5 Hotel California B6 Eye Of The Tiger  ------------------------  "Super Freak" is a 1981 hit single produced and performed by Rick James. The song\, co-written by James and Alonzo Miller\, was first released on James' album Street Songs and became one of James' signature songs. It features background vocals from Motown labelmates The Temptations\, in which the bass singer is James' uncle Melvin Franklin\, and Canadian singer Taborah Johnson. "Freak" is a slang term for\, as described in the song's lyrics\, "...a very kinky girl / The kind you don't take home to mother". Rolling Stone magazine ranked the song #477 in its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.  Chart history  The song was a big hit for James in 1981\, charting on the pop\, R&B and dance charts in the U.S. On the Billboard Hot 100 chart\, the song peaked at #16 in the fall of 1981 and spent 10 weeks in the top 40. Together with two other singles from Street Songs\, "Give It to Me Baby" and "Ghetto Life"\, it spent three weeks at #1 on the American dance charts earlier that year.  Cover versions  In 1984\, Los Angeles-based novelty band Big Daddy (whose comic conceit was to cover fast songs as ballads and slow songs up-tempo\, and all contemporary songs done in 1950s style) recorded the song to a slower beat as if it had been done by the Everly Brothers.  In 1989\, the song was covered by thrash metal band Mordred on their album Fool's Game.  In 2006\, Chicago-based alternative rock band Straitjacket covered this song on their album Vices.  In 2006\, a cover by Billy Crawford was included on the soundtrack to the 2006 animated film Asterix and the Vikings.  In 2007\, the song was covered in bluegrass style by Ricky Skaggs and Bruce Hornsby on their eponymous collaborative album.  Live cover performances  Australian Idol 4 finalist Bobby Flynn performed a version of the song in 2006.  In 2004\, the Dave Matthews Band covered Super Freak live on Alpine Valley Music Theatre. The song features on Live Trax Vol. 8.  The song was covered by Irish band Dirty Epics on The Podge and Rodge Show in February 2009.  Sampling  The riff of the song was most popularly sampled in 1989 by MC Hammer in his best known single\, "U Can't Touch This". The song was also sampled Wassuup by Da Muttz in 2001.  Hip hop artist GZA/Genius sampled the song on his debut 1991 album Words from the Genius.  In 1997\, artist Jude's song entitled "Rick James" (#28 Billboard Modern Rock Chart) featured the words "Oh\, Rick James was the original Super Freak" in its chorus line.  In 2006\, the Beatfreakz covered the song\, as "Superfreak"\, and gained a #7 UK hit with it.  The title track of Jay-Z's 2006 comeback album Kingdom Come features a sample from "Super Freak".  In the 2007 song "Freaky Gurl" by Gucci Mane\, the lines in the chorus pay homage to the original Rick James song.  In 2007\, French actor/rapper Disiz la Peste released a rap song in French that uses of "Super Freak" as the instrumental backing.  In popular culture  In the 1986 movie Heartbreak Ridge\, Mario Van Peebles as Corporal 'Stitch' Jones\, sings most of the song before he is thrown out of a bar.  An instrumental version of the song was featured in the 1992 movie Batman Returns.  In a 1998 episode of Just Shoot Me\, disappointed to find out she hadn't been the inspiration to the fictional song "Nina in The Cantina"\, Nina Van Horn found solace in the belief that she was at least the inspiration to Rick James' Super Freak.  In the 2006 comedy film Little Miss Sunshine\, Olive Hoover (Abigail Breslin) performs a burlesque routine to the song at a children's beauty pageant.  On the episode of One on One\, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air star Alfonso Ribeiro sings the song on the season 1 episode\, "Me and My Shadow" which originally aired in 2002 where Flex (Flex Alexander) and Duane (Kelly Perine) decide to have a high school band.  In Season 4 of the A-Team\, Rick James guest stars and performs this song in the episode 'The Heart of Rock n Roll'  In an episode of George Lopez\, George sings this song to the baby he thinks is in Angie's womb.	0

Only mine's broke down And now I've no-one to love  So I find out your reason For the phone calls and smiles And it hurts And I'm lonely And I should never have tried And I missed you tonight It must be time to leave You see it meant everything to me	0

COL title VAL I Wish I Knew COL performer VAL Joni James	COL video title VAL Ruth Etting - I'll Get By (As Long As I Have You) 1929 COL channel name VAL warholsoup100 COL description VAL Columbia 1733 - This Song Peaked At #3 On US Music Charts In 1929. "I'll Get By (As Long as I Have You)" is a popular song with music by Fred E. Ahlert and lyrics by Roy Turk. It was published in 1928 and originally sung by Aileen Stanley. Ruth Etting (November 23\, 1897 — September 24\, 1978) was an American singing star and actress of the 1920s and 1930s\, who had over 60 hit recordings and worked in stage\, radio\, and film.  Born in David City\, Nebraska in 1897 to Alfred and Winifred (née Kleinhan) Etting. When Ruth was five years old\, her mother died and she went to live with her paternal grandparents\, George and Hannah Etting. Alfred Etting remarried and moved away from David City and largely out of his daughter's life. Ruth Etting left David City at the age of seventeen to attend art school in Chicago. Her job designing costumes at the Marigold Gardens nightclub led to employment singing and dancing in the chorus there. She became a featured vocalist at the nightclub\, and married gangster Martin "Moe the Gimp" Snyder on July 12\, 1922. He managed her career\, booking radio appearances\, and eventually had her signed to an exclusive recording contract with Columbia Records. She made her Broadway debut in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1927. She went on to appear in a number of other hit shows in rapid succession\, including Simple Simon and Whoopee!. In Hollywood\, she made a long series of movie shorts between 1929 and 1936\, and three feature movies in 1933 and 1934. In 1936\, she appeared in London in Ray Henderson's Transatlantic Rhythm. Etting divorced Moe Snyder on November 30\, 1937\, aged 40. She fell in love with her pianist\, Myrl Alderman\, but in 1938 he was shot and injured by her ex-husband. Snyder was convicted of attempted murder\, but released on appeal after one year in jail. Etting married Alderman\, who was almost a decade her junior\, in December 1938. The scandal of the sensational trial in Los Angeles effectively ended her career\, though she briefly had a radio show in 1947. Alderman died on November 16\, 1966. Ruth Etting died in Colorado Springs\, Colorado in 1978\, aged 80. She had no children. Her life was the basis for the fictionalized 1955 film\, Love Me or Leave Me\, which starred Doris Day (as Etting) and James Cagney (as Snyder).	0
