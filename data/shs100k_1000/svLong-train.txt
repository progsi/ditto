Burt Bacharach (Kansas City\, Missouri\, 12 de maio de 1928) é um pianista e compositor norte-americano. Nos anos 50 e começo dos 60 ele foi o pianista e maestro de Marlene Dietrich.

Mai 1928 in Kansas City\, Missouri) ist ein US-amerikanischer Pianist und Komponist. Seit 1957 gehört er zu den erfolgreichsten Komponisten Amerikas\, rund 130 seiner Werke haben die Single-Charts seiner Heimat erreicht.  Ein Großteil seiner Lieder entstand in langjähriger Zusammenarbeit mit dem Texter Hal David und im Anschluss daran mit Carole Bayer Sager. Besonders erfolgreich waren die mit David in den 1960er und 1970er Jahren verfassten Songs für Dionne Warwick.  Für seine Leistungen erhielt Bacharach so gut wie alle wichtigen Preise der Entertainmentindustrie\, darunter mehrere Grammys\, Oscars und Golden Globes.

COL title VAL It's Now or Never COL performer VAL Chris Isaak	COL video title VAL Maud Powell - (Coleridge-Taylor/Powell) Deep River COL channel name VAL 2ndviolinist COL description VAL Maud Powell (August 22\, 1867  January 8\, 1920) IMHO the best American violinist.  MAUD POWELL - A Pioneer's Legacy by Karen A. Shaffer (edited to fit) Maud Powell was born on August 22\, 1867\, in Peru\, Illinois\, on the western frontier in the American heartland. Her grandparents had been Methodist missionaries in Ohio\, Wisconsin\, and Illinois before the Civil War. Her father William Bramwell Powell was an innovative educator; superintendent of the public schools in Peru\, then Aurora\, IL\, and finally Washington\, D.C. Her mother Minnie Paul Powell was a pianist and composer whose gender precluded a career. Minnie and Bramwell's sisters were active in the woman's suffrage movement. Maud's uncle John Wesley Powell\, Civil War hero and explorer of the Grand Canyon\, organized the scientific study of the western lands and the native Indians as the powerful director of the U.S. Geological Survey and Bureau of Ethnology and founder of the National Geographic Society.  A prodigy\, Powell began violin and piano study in Aurora\, Illinois\, then studied violin four years with William Lewis in Chicago\, to whom she "owed the most." She completed her training with Europe's greatest masters -- Henry Schradieck in Leipzig\, Charles Dancla in Paris\, and Joseph Joachim in Berlin. Returning to the United States knowing that "girl violinists were looked upon with suspicion\," Powell boldly walked into a rehearsal of the all-male New York Philharmonic in Steinway Hall and demanded a hearing from Theodore Thomas\, then America's foremost conductor. Deeply impressed\, Thomas acknowledged his "musical grandchild" and hired her on the spot to perform the Bruch G minor violin concerto with the New York Philharmonic on November 14\, 1885. New York critic Henry E. Krehbiel acclaimed the 18-year-old's debut performance: "She is a marvellously gifted woman\, one who in every feature of her playing discloses the instincts and gifts of a born artist."  The young violinist pioneered the violin recital as she blazed new concert circuits throughout the country\, even braving the primitive touring conditions in the Far West to reach people who had never heard a concert before. She explained: "I do not play to them as an artist to the public\, but as one human being to another." Theodore Thomas chose Maud Powell to represent America's achievement in violin performance at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. During the 1893 Exposition\, Powell presented a paper to the Women's Musical Congress\, "Women and the Violin\," in which she encouraged young women to take up the violin seriously. At a time when women could not vote and were precluded from playing in professional orchestras\, she argued that there was no reason why a woman should not play the violin with the best of the men.  Powell herself had proved to the world that a woman could play the violin as well as a man\, fulfilling the shared hopes of her mother and woman suffrage leaders Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Her example inspired young girls to take up the violin and women to form music clubs and orchestras throughout the land.  Powell became one of America's most revered and beloved musicians while her 1907 recording of Drdla's Souvenir became the most popular violin record of its day.  Maud Powell toured Europe\, North America and South Africa to wide acclaim\, appearing with the great orchestras of her time under such conductors as Mahler\, Nikisch\, Thomas\, Safonov\, Damrosch\, Seidl\, Richter\, Wood\, Herbert and Stokowski.  Perhaps Powell's greatest artistic triumph was her American premiere (November 30\, 1906) of the Sibelius Violin Concerto\, which she glowingly described as "a gigantic rugged thing\, an epic really....It is on new lines and has a new technique. O\, it is wonderful." Powell introduced fourteen violin concertos to the American public -- by Tchaikovsky\, Dvořák\, Saint-Saëns\, Lalo\, Sibelius\, Coleridge-Taylor\, Arensky\, Aulin\, Huss\, Shelley\, Conus\, Bruch and Rimsky-Korsakov. She also revived neglected works of the 18th century\, including Mozart's Sinfonia Concertante for violin and viola\, and even edited a Locatelli violin sonata for publication. She boldly championed works by American composers. Maud Powell died the year the 19th Amendment granting national suffrage to women was ratified. Upon her death on January 8\, 1920\, the New York Symphony paid tribute to this "supreme and unforgettable artist": "She was not only America's great master of the violin\, but a woman of lofty purpose and noble achievement\, whose life and art brought to countless thousands inspiration for the good and the beautiful." © Karen A.

COL title VAL Blowin' in the Wind COL performer VAL Walter Jackson	COL video title VAL Blowin' In The Wind By The Chad Mitchell Trio COL channel name VAL CompVid101 COL description VAL The Chad Mitchell Trio performs what was the first commercial recording of the Bob Dylan classic other than by Dylan himself.  The song had been brought to the CMT by their musical director and arranger\, Milt Okun\, and the Trio (already famous for its satirical political songs) was eager to record the number\, release it as a single\, and title what would be their third album after it.  An old school producer at the group's Kapp Records label vetoed the ideas\, however\, maintaining that "no song with death in the lyrics was ever a hit\,"  and the album was released as "The Chad Mitchell Trio In Action."  Okun\, however\, was also the musical director and arranger for another young and eager folk trio called Peter\, Paul\, and Mary\, and he brought the song to them. PP&M did everything that the CMT had wanted to do with the song. They titled an album "In The Wind\," released the song as a single (it sold a million copies and hit #2 on the "Billboard" charts) and performed the number before ML King's "I have a dream " speech during the August\, 1963 civil rights March On Washington. The success of the song made both Dylan and PP&M household names in the U.S.  The Chad Mitchell Trio still performs with its original lineup\, and its fans often wonder "what if....?" about the group's stirring version of the song.	1

"The Hucklebuck" was a Big Band and Jump Jive standard from the 40's. Everybody had a variation of it in their repertoire. The reason was that 'hucklebuck' was a euphemism for something the latter part of it rhymed with. When couples trysted to it on the dancefloor\, band leaders knew how to swing that sexual energy. It survived into Rock'n'Roll through versions like Chubby Checker's\, which may be where the Birdies learned to shake a tailfeather.   The "Girls In the Garage" CD I culled it from was no help for any info about them. (Where are Alec Palao or Lois Wilson when you need them? Hopefully making the all-girls NUGGETS box set of my dreams!) But a fan informed me they were another guise of Darlene Love & the Blossoms! Ms. Love is legendary for her chameleonic turns behind the mike under different names: The Crystals ("He's a Rebel"); Bobb B. Soxx & the Blue Jeans; and the K-C-Ettes\, behind guitarist Al Casey ("Surfin' Hootenanny"). Darlene had a funny story of evading producer Phil Spector when he was mad at her for working other studios under aliases\, but now that story sounds really ominous. Darlene is also famous for portraying Danny Glover's wife in the 'Lethal Weapon' movies\, and is just as potent a performer today.    To have a Movement\, ya gotta move first. Rock propelled the hips before it prodded people to be hip in awareness. As Feminism would soon declare\, "the personal is political".  Just the act of freeing your body\, your inhibitions\, your appearance\, your choice of partner\, or your choice of music was tantamount to a political action. In a turbulent time when the youth were starting to question everything about any arbitrary boundaries\, every move they made away from these was rebellion. No neat little boxes for them. More like a spectrum of rooms to explore and exceed. In this moment\, the air is electric with the tension of possibility...

Also #3 for Hal McIntyre and His Orchestra in April 1945\, #4 for the Merry Macs in June 1945 and #47 (on the Country chart) for Dave Dudley in 1976.

Other members of the DSC in Bob's quartet are bassist Henk Bosch van Drakensteyn and drummer Huub Janssen. It would not be possible without an excellent pianist. His name is Marcel Hendricks. For this broadcast recorded in Restaurant-Pub de Boerenhofstede in the small town in Laren Holland they had a special guest\, Dani Dorice on vibraphone from France. Of course we all know the talent and fame of the Benny Goodman Quartet from a generation before but here is a group that every Dutchman should be proud of. These musicians swing just as confident and with the same talented skills as these former giants.  Now in 2007 Bob Kaper is the leader of the Dutch Swing College band and Marcel Hendricks its pianist.	0

COL title VAL O Holy Night COL performer VAL Anthem Lights	COL video title VAL O Holy Night. - Tevin Campbell (A Very Special Christmas Vol\, 2) COL channel name VAL TsDSeason2BJolly COL description VAL Tevin Campbell Biography Tevin Jermod Campbell (born November 12\, 1976) is a five-time Grammy-nominated American R&B singer-songwriter. Campbell scored a string of R&B chart hits as a teenager in the early to mid-1990s. Campbell transitioned from child singer to adult R&B crooner\, and is a recognizable figure in the New Jack Swing genre of music.  Born in Dallas\, Texas\, Campbell was introduced to the R&B by Quincy Jones in August 1989. Campbell's debut single was "Tomorrow (A Better You Better Me)" which reached number 1 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip hop Singles chart in June 1990. It was the lead single from Quincy Jones' critically acclaimed ensemble LP Back on the Block which won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1991. After working with Jones and writers and producers including Siedah Garrett\, Campbell worked with producers Narada Michael Walden\, Al B. Sure\, Babyface\, and others to record additional music.  Campbell's first solo hit was "Round and Round"\, which charted at #3 on R&B charts in November 1991 and #13 on the Billboard Hot 100 in April 1991 was produced by Prince and was featured in Prince's film Graffiti Bridge. Campbell followed the success of his first two singles by releasing his debut album\, T.E.V.I.N.\, in November 1991 which featured the R&B hit singles and Campbell's only #1 Adult Contemporary hit: "Tell Me What You Want Me To Do" followed by:\, "Alone With You"\, and "Goodbye". His second album\, I'm Ready released October 1993\, yielded the #1 R&B hit and #9 pop single "Can We Talk" in December 1993\, "I'm Ready"\, "Always in My Heart" which charted at #3 on the R&B chart. He also scored a Top 30 hit with "Don't Say Goodbye Girl" on the R&B charts. In September 1994\, Campbell also scored an R&B hit with the single "U Will Know" as part of the R&B supergroup Black Men United\, a group that also included singer Usher.  The year 1996 saw the release of his third album\, Back to the World (#11 R&B). The title track was a success (hitting the R&B Top 20)\, but additional singles failed to make an impact on the chart. His early 1999 self-titled album was found Campbell venturing into the neo-soul venue. The project was rushed\, and as a result charted below the R&B Top 30\, with only one single charting\, a Top 30 song called "Another Way".  Campbell was nominated for five Grammy Awards and two American Music Awards.	1

Más tarde firmó con RCA Victor . En 1944\, su primer disco de éxito fue "Twilight Time "\, escrita por la banda junto con Buck Ram . "Twilight Time" vendió más de cuatro millones de copias y fue galardonado con un disco de oro. El siguiente éxito  "Peg o' My Heart"\, que fueuno de los discos más vendidos de 1947 en los Estados Unidos. El grupo apareció en Alfred Hitchcock's Rope  (1948) y en la película  Two Gals and a Guy (1951).  El grupo sufrió varios cambios de formación en la década de 1950\, y se separó brevemente a mitad de la década antes de que Dunn resucitase  el nombre con una nueva formación. La popularidad del grupo se desvaneció y su significación histórica quedó en el olvido\, esencialmente como consecuencia del rock and roll \, pero el interés en el conjunto fue renovado en la década de los 90 por los fans de la música lounge y exotica .

COL title VAL When Your Lover Has Gone COL performer VAL Ricky Nelson	COL video title VAL "South of the Border" (Gene Autry\, 1939) COL channel name VAL RReady555 COL description VAL One of "The Singing Cowboy"'s finest numbers\, from the Republic picture "Down Mexico Way".  Written by Jimmy Kennedy and Michael Carr.  SOUTH OF THE BORDER  South of the border\, down Mexico way\, That's where I fell in love When the stars above came out to play. And now as I wander\, my thoughts ever stray South of the border\, down Mexico way.  She was a picture in old Spanish lace. And for a tender while I kissed the smile upon her face. For it was fiesta\, and we were so gay South of the border\, Mexico way.  Then she sighed as she whispered 'manana' Never dreaming that we were parting. And I lied as I whispered 'manana' For our tomorrow never came.  South of the border\, I rode back one day There in a veil of white by candlelight She knelt to pray. The mission bells told me that I mustn't stay South of the border\, down Mexico way.  Ai-ai-ai-ai (ai-ai-ai-ai) Ai-ai-ai-ai (ai-ai-ai-ai) Ai-ai-ai-ai ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  From Wiki:  "South of the Border" is a popular song describing a trip to Mexico\, written by Jimmy Kennedy and Michael Carr and published in 1939 for the film of the same name starring country star Gene Autry.[1]  In the lyrics\, a man looks back with regret and pain for having lied to the woman he can't forget ("...and now as I wander\, my thoughts ever stray...") and returned for too late\, just as she was preparing for marriage. The lyric is in juxtaposition with the music\, which swings with syncopated joy.  The song was a hit in 1939 for Shep Fields\, vocal by Hal Derwin. It has been recorded by many artists\, but the best-known versions are by Autry and Frank Sinatra (1953). The song was recorded in August 1961 by Patsy Cline for her album Patsy Cline Showcase and appears on Herb Alpert's 1964 album South of the Border.	0

COL title VAL No Fun COL performer VAL Sex Pistols	COL video title VAL John Lee Hooker - Going Down COL channel name VAL The Jukebox Rebel COL description VAL From his LP “Born In Mississippi\, Raised Up In Tennessee” (ABC Records ABCX-768) issued in 1973.  The album was recorded at Wally Heider Recording\, San Francisco over the course of two days\, September 28th-29th\, 1971.  This song\, written by Don Nix\, was originally done by Moloch in 1969. It closes side 1 and emerges as my favourite on the LP. Van Morrison appears casually\, and plays his part in an intriguing 10 minutes\, impressive for its spontaneity and heady mix of instrumentation. John Lee and Van would meet sporadically on several occasions in the decades which followed\, both live and in the studio.  Playing on this one were: John Lee Hooker (vocals\, guitar); Van Morrison (vocals\, guitar); Don "Sugarcane" Harris (violin); Steve Miller (electric piano); Mark Naftalin (piano); Robert Hooker (organ); Elvin Bishop (slide guitar); Gino Skaggs (fender bass) and Chuck Crimelli (drums).  Nine of them - it's like a blues orchestra! Must have been a big studio :-)  The LP is reviewed on my Album Chart of 1973: http://thejukeboxrebel.wikidot.com/album-chart-of-1973	0

(Tom Jones Cover) COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven COL description VAL From ''Something Special For The Kids '' Label: Blood Red Vinyl & Discs ‎– BRCD5006 Format: CD\, Album Country: US Released: 1998  Tracklist 01. Beatles Please Come Back (Gigi Parker & the Lonelies) 02. Fire Brigade (The Move) 03. Don't Ever Leave Me (Connie Francis) 04. Gotta Get A Hold Of Myself (The Zombies) 05.

Boys Keep Swinging (David Bowie)  After playing mutant swamp-blues-rockabilly guitar with the Gun Club in the early '80s\, Ward Dotson embarked on a less contrived musical course as guitarist\, main writer and de facto leader of the Pontiac Brothers. Dotson subsequently formed the Liquor Giants. "You're Always Welcome" (1992) (aka "America's #1 Recording Artists" in japan) was a dynamic debut. After "Here" (1994) and "Liquor Giants" (1996)\, The Giants were an actual band on "Every Other Day at a Time". Mark McGroarty (bass and vocals) and Mark McNally (guitar and vocals) joined Dotson and Simon for the best album released under the Liquor Giants name. Around the same time\, (actually two of these covers were featured on "Every Other Day at a Time")\, the Giants issued a covers collection\, "Something Special for the Kids"\, with sparkling renditions of classics by Tom Jones\, the Move\, David Bowie and others.  ------------------------  "What's New Pussycat?" is a song written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David for the movie of the same name\, sung by Tom Jones. Nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1966\, it was Jones' third UK top 30 record\, peaking at number 11.  The original single included a 13-second instrumental introduction\, ending in the sound of shattering glass\, but later issues omitted this introduction.  It has also been performed by: Bobby Darin\, Tony Bennett\, Alvin and the Chipmunks\, Anita Kerr\, The Wailers and The Four Seasons. Barbra Streisand performed several lines in her "Color Me Barbra Medley" from the TV special and album Color Me Barbra. The Czech singer Pavel Novák recorded song in 1966 under the title "Žofie".  Cultural references  In The Simpsons episode "Husbands and Knives"\, the character Milo plays a Korean version of "What's New Pussycat?" In another episode "Marge Gets a Job"\, when Marge worked at the nuclear power plant she requested to have Tom Jones music being played there so they played this song.  In an episode of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\, Carlton sings this song when he comes home the next morning after losing his virginity.  In an episode of That 70's Show\, Bob sings this song on the tape recorder for Eric recording incidents while he is in Africa.  In an episode of Living Single\, Kyle sings a few bars of "What's New\, Pussycat?" at a memorial service of a cat killed while Synclaire was pet-sitting.  Ed Begley\, Jr. sings the song to a group of felines at the zoo in the 1982 movie Cat People.  John Mulaney's stand-up routine "The Salt and Pepper Diner" recounts a story where he and a friend purchased 21 consecutive plays of the song on a diner jukebox. The song became viral after being referenced.  The song also appears in the end credits of the computer animated movie Flushed Away.  The song is used as the end credits' theme of the popular 2001 movie Cats & Dogs.  The song is featured twice in the 1998 film Paulie.  Steve Martin sings a line or two in the 1991 film Father of the Bride.  In Turbo\, the song is played on Turbo's music shell.  In 2004\, the song was used in the movie The Life and Death of Peter Sellers during the movies opening credits.  In ADDITION like MAGIC\, the song played in the Wurlitzer Jukebox because Timmy shocked hands with Cosmo.  In Who Is That Blackface?!\, The ringtone was "Ma-a-a-a-agic" by Yea Man Productions and Timmy knew this song from the radio station Wassup from the radio.  ------------------------  What's New Pussycat? is a 1965 comedy film directed by Clive Donner and starring Peter Sellers\, Peter O'Toole\, Romy Schneider\, Capucine\, Paula Prentiss and Ursula Andress. It was Woody Allen's film debut\, as well as his first produced script. The Academy Award-nominated title song by Burt Bacharach (music) and Hal David (lyrics) was sung by Tom Jones. The movie poster was painted by Frank Frazetta.	0

It was written by Otis Blackwell and Jack Hammer. The Jerry Lee Lewis 1957 recording was ranked as the 96th greatest song ever by Rolling Stone. The song is in AABA form.  Jerry Lee Lewis recording  The song is best known for Jerry Lee Lewis's original recording\, which was recorded in the Sun Studio in Memphis\, Tennessee\, on October 8\, 1957\, and released as a 45rpm single on Sun 281 in November 1957. It reached #2 on the Billboard pop charts\, #3 on the R&B charts\, and #1 on the country charts. It also reached #1 on the UK pop charts\, appeared on the New Zealand Singles Chart\, and the Dutch Top 40.  The song was featured in a performance by Jerry Lee Lewis and his band in the 1957 Warner Brothers rock and roll film Jamboree\, which also featured Carl Perkins\, Fats Domino\, Buddy Knox\, and Dick Clark. The recording was also released in the UK on London Records.  The song title is derived from a Southern expression\, which some Christians consider blasphemous\, that refers to the Pentecost's defining moment when the Holy Spirit manifested itself as "cloven tongues as of fire" and the Apostles spoke in tongues.  Legacy  Monty Python references the song's title in the "World Forum" sketch\, a fake game show\, as heard on the live album Monty Python Live at City Center. Terry Gilliam\, portraying Mao Zedong\, says the song title as the only correct answer the "distinguished panel" offers in the early rounds. The song was used for the New York City audience in place of "Sing\, Little Birdie\," which was the song title used in the original sketch.

COL title VAL What the World Needs Now Is Love COL performer VAL Steve Tyrell featuring Burt Bacharach\, Martina McBride\, Rod Stewart\, James Taylor and Dionne Warwick	COL video title VAL "What The World Needs Now Is Love" (1968) The Staple Singers COL channel name VAL Gospel Nostalgia COL description VAL This is track 1 from the 1968 album "What The World Needs Now Is Love". Lead by Mavis Staples Written by Hal David and Burt Bacharach The family began appearing in Chicago-area churches in 1948\, and signed their first professional contract in 1952. During their early career they recorded in an acoustic gospel-folk style with various labels: United Records\, Vee-Jay Records(their "Uncloudy Day" and "Will The Circle Be Unbroken" were best sellers)\, Checker Records\, Riverside Records\, and then Epic Records in 1965. While the family surname is "Staples"\, the group used the singular form for its name\, resulting in the group's name being "The Staple Singers".  It was on Epic that the Staple Singers began moving into mainstream pop markets\, with "Why (Am I Treated So Bad)" and "For What It's Worth" (Stephen Stills) in 1967. In 1968\, the Staple Singers signed to Stax Records and released two albums with Steve Cropper and Booker T & the MG's — Soul Folk in Action and We'll Get Over. By 1970\, Al Bell had become producer\, and with Engineer Terry Manning\, the family began recording at the famed Muscle Shoals Sound Studio\, and Memphis' Ardent Studios\, moving in a more funk and soul direction.  The first Stax hit was "Heavy Makes You Happy (Sha-Na-Boom Boom)". Their 1971 recording of "Respect Yourself"\, written by Luther Ingram and Mack Rice\, peaked at #2 on the R&B charts and was a #12 pop hit as well. The song's theme of self-empowerment had universal appeal\, released in the period immediately following the intense American civil rights movement of the 1960s. In 1972\, the group had a huge #1 hit in the United States with "I'll Take You There". It topped both pop and R&B charts. "If You're Ready (Come Go With Me)" would become another big hit\, reaching #9 pop and #1 on the R&B chart in 1973. Then\, after Stax's bankruptcy in 1975\, they signed to Curtis Mayfield's label\, Curtom Records\, and released "Let's Do It Again"\, produced by Mayfield; the song became their second #1 pop hit in the US and the album also. In 1976\, they collaborated with The Band for their film The Last Waltz\, performing on the song "The Weight" (which The Staple Singers had previously covered on their first Stax album). However\, they were not able to regain their momentum\, releasing only occasional minor hits. Their 1984 album Turning Point featured their final Top 40 hit\, a cover of Talking Heads' "Slippery People" (which also reached the Top 5 on the Dance chart). In 1994\, they again performed the song "The Weight" with Country music artist Marty Stuart for MCA Nashville's Rhythm\, Country and Blues compilation\, somewhat re-establishing an audience. The song "Respect Yourself" was used by Spike Lee in the soundtrack to his movie Crooklyn\, made in 1994.  In 1999\, the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Pops Staples died of complications from a concussion suffered in December 2000. In 2005\, the group was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Mavis Staples has continued to carry on the family tradition and continues to add her vocal talents to both the projects of other artists and her own solo ventures. Cleotha Staples died in Chicago on February 21\, 2013\, after suffering from Alzheimer's disease for over a decade.	1

James Battle "Texas Jim" Robertson was born February 2\, 1909 near Batesville\, Texas. He recorded more than one hundred sides for RCA Victor and Bluebird during the 1940s but never released a 12" LP. When Robertson was not joined by his band\, the Panhandle Punchers\, sidemen on his recordings included Roy Wiggins\, Andy Sanella\, and Vaughn Horton on steel guitar\, some with Chet Atkins on electric guitar\, and probably Jethro Burns on mandolin. Robertson was reported dead by suicide in 1966 at age 57. One year later\, a man named Clifford Kent begins performing in Fort Worth and claims to be Texas Jim Robertson. He tells of a fire in his New York city apartment and his wish to change his identity.

COL description VAL Long\, Long Time~ Music & Lyrics by: Gary White~ Performed by: Mindy McCready~  Here's one of my favorite love songs\, in the country music category\, "Long\, Long Time\,"  recorded by the young country artist\, Mindy McCready. This song belongs to the album "Mindy McCready: Super Hits\," which was released in January of 2000.  My three other favorite songs from Mindy are "You'll Never Know\," "Oh Romeo\," and "Ten Thousand Angels\," which also can be found in the same album.  "Long\, Long Time" is actually a classic love song that was first recorded and made famous in 1970 by one of the hottest female artists of the 70's\, Linda Ronstadt. "Long\, Long Time" earned Linda her first Grammy nomination (for Best Contemporary Vocal Performance/Female).  "Long\, Long Time" is a tearjerker\, a sad love song\, written for the lonely hearts... living in the memory of a love that never was... Listen to the melody and the lyrics and you'll know what I mean--they are "hauntingly"...good.  ´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´ A Message from WhiteLibraTexas:  WhiteLibraTexas is a YouTube partner.

Arthur Ferrante  (7 de septiembre de 1921\, Nueva York - 19 de septiembre de 2009)\, y Louis Teicher (24 de agosto de 1924\, Wilkes-Barre\, Pennsylvania  - 3 de agosto de 2008) se conocieron mientras estudiaban en la Escuela Juilliard de Música de Nueva York. Niños prodigios de la música\, que comenzaron  a actuar como dúo de piano cuando aún estaban en la escuela.  En 1947\, comenzaron a dedicarse por completo al mundo de la música y rápidamente empiezan a ascender  tocando música clásica con respaldo orquestal. Steven Tyler de Aerosmith relata la historia de que en la década de 1950\, los dos estudiantes ensayaban en la casa de su abuela Constanza Neidhart Tallarico.  Entre 1950 y 1980\, fueron un importante dúo de música  easy listening\, consiguiendo  cuatro grandes EE.UU. golpea:  El tema de  "The Apartment" \, el Tema  de "Exodus  \, "Tonight" y "Cowboy de medianoche". Realizaron actuaciones y grabaciones de forma regular con las orquestas de George Gershwin \, Jerome Kern \, Cole Porter \, Richard Rodgers y otros  El dúo también experimentó con pianos preparados\, agregando papel\, palos de goma\, bloques de madera\, barras de metal\, cadenas\, cristales\, mazos y otros objetos que colocaban en las cuerdas del piano. De esta manera fueron capaces de producir una variedad de sonidos extraños que a veces se parecían a los instrumentos de percusión\, y en otras ocasiones sonaban como si se hubieran sintetizado electrónicamente.  Ferrante y Teicher dejaron de actuar en 1989 y se retiraron  a Longboat Key y Siesta Key \, respectivamente\, ambos cerca uno del otro en la costa oeste de Florida. Seguían tocando juntos\, de vez en cuando\, en una tienda local de pianos . Louis Teicher falleció de un ataque al corazón en agosto de 2008\, tres semanas antes de su cumpleaños número 84. Arthur Ferrante falleció de causas naturales el 19 de septiembre de 2009 a la edad de 88 años.  iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/es/album/hi-fiireworks/id837731730  Síguenos en: Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/vintagem.es Spotify: http://open.spotify.com/user/vintagemusic Web: http://www.vintagemusic.es BoutiqAlia: http://boutiqalia.com/store/vintage/ (compra física de CD) Compra nuestros Cd's en formato físico en estas plataformas: Ebay:  http://stores.ebay.com/VintageMusicFm BoutiqAlia: www.boutiqalia-vintagemusic.com Síguenos en: Spotify: https://goo.gl/raouHQ Facebook: https://goo.gl/L92BHL Instagram: https://goo.gl/3oYDGH Web: http://www.vintagemusic.es   Compra nuestros Cd's en formato físico en estas plataformas: Ebay:  http://stores.ebay.com/VintageMusicFm BoutiqAlia: www.boutiqalia-vintagemusic.com Discogs: https://www.discogs.com/es/seller/vintagemusicfm/profile	0

Arthur Ferrante (New York City\, 7 september - 1921 - 19 september 2009) en Louis Teicher (Wilkes Barre\, 24 augustus 1924 - 3 augustus 2008) leerden elkaar kennen toen zij studeerden aan de "Juilliard School" voor muziek in New York. Beiden waren muzikaal zeer begaafd en begonnen als pianoduo op te treden\, toen ze nog op school zaten. Na hun afstuderen gingen beiden aan de slag aan de Juilliard-faculteit.  In 1947 begonnen zij een voltijdse concertcarrière. Ze speelden eerst in nachtclubs\, maar schakelden al snel over naar het spelen van klassieke muziek met orkestbegeleiding. Tussen 1950 en 1980 waren zij een der belangrijkste Amerikaanse "easy listening"-groepen en scoorden zij vier grote hits: "Theme From The Apartment" (Pop #10)\, "Exodus" (Pop #2)\, "Tonight" (Pop #8)\, and "Midnight Cowboy" (Pop #10). Zij traden op en namen platen op met nummers van George Gershwin\, Jerome Kern\, Cole Porter en Richard Rodgers. In 1973 speelden zij het openingsnummer van het radiodrama The Zero Hour van Rod Sterling. Het duo deed ook aan "avant garde".	0

COL title VAL Let It Be Me COL performer VAL Bob Dylan	COL video title VAL The Sweet Inspirations - Let It Be Me COL channel name VAL Kerith Louisa Williams-Catton COL description VAL Info: The Sweet Inspirations were an American R&B girl group mostly known for their work as backup singers on studio recordings for other R&B and rock artists. A founding member of the group was Dionne Warwick\, who was later replaced by her aunt\, Cissy Houston. The Sweet Inspirations was founded by former members of The Drinkard Singers\, a long-running Gospel singing group whose membership included Cissy Houston (née Drinkard\, and mother of Whitney Houston\, 1963) and Lee Warwick\, who was Cissy's sister and the mother of Sweet Inspirations members Dee Dee and Dionne Warwick). As a backup group\, the Sweet Inspirations were in high demand among producers\, publishers\, artists\, and songwriters in the early 1960s. The original lineup included Doris Troy and the two Warwick sisters Dionne & Dee Dee. Sylvia Shemwell (sister of Judy Clay) replaced Troy\, while Cissy Houston took over from Dionne\, with Dee Dee Warwick as the group's official leader. The group sang backup for many stars\, including Solomon Burke\, Aretha Franklin\, Wilson Pickett\, and Esther Phillips. Dee Dee left in 1965\, when her solo career began to take off. She was replaced by Myrna Smith. Estelle Brown joined the team soon after\, and the line-up that was to become an Atlantic recording group was set. The Sweet Inspirations recorded by themselves for the first time in April 1967 for Atlantic Records. That session produced the first two singles released by Atlantic\, a version of "Why (Am I Treated So Bad)\," a song previously recorded by The Staple Singers and a soulful version of "Let It Be Me"\, a French song which had been a pop and R&B hit for Betty Everett & Jerry Butler in 1964.	1

In 1966 Shaw's orchestra performed Themes for Secret Agents.Themes from the James Bond Thrillers Vol.3/More James Bond in Action followed the release of Casino Royale and You Only Live Twice in 1967.

The song was a single released in 1964 shortly after Jims death (King Record label KG1016)\, and it was also found on the album 'The Two Sides of Larry Cunningham'. I remember hearing this song on the gramophone in my Auntie's house in the mid 60's and thinking how sad it was.	1

Written by Jimmy Kennedy and Michael Carr.  SOUTH OF THE BORDER  South of the border\, down Mexico way\, That's where I fell in love When the stars above came out to play. And now as I wander\, my thoughts ever stray South of the border\, down Mexico way.  She was a picture in old Spanish lace. And for a tender while I kissed the smile upon her face. For it was fiesta\, and we were so gay South of the border\, Mexico way.  Then she sighed as she whispered 'manana' Never dreaming that we were parting. And I lied as I whispered 'manana' For our tomorrow never came.  South of the border\, I rode back one day There in a veil of white by candlelight She knelt to pray. The mission bells told me that I mustn't stay South of the border\, down Mexico way.  Ai-ai-ai-ai (ai-ai-ai-ai) Ai-ai-ai-ai (ai-ai-ai-ai) Ai-ai-ai-ai ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  From Wiki:  "South of the Border" is a popular song describing a trip to Mexico\, written by Jimmy Kennedy and Michael Carr and published in 1939 for the film of the same name starring country star Gene Autry.[1]  In the lyrics\, a man looks back with regret and pain for having lied to the woman he can't forget ("...and now as I wander\, my thoughts ever stray...") and returned for too late\, just as she was preparing for marriage. The lyric is in juxtaposition with the music\, which swings with syncopated joy.  The song was a hit in 1939 for Shep Fields\, vocal by Hal Derwin. It has been recorded by many artists\, but the best-known versions are by Autry and Frank Sinatra (1953). The song was recorded in August 1961 by Patsy Cline for her album Patsy Cline Showcase and appears on Herb Alpert's 1964 album South of the Border.	0

COL title VAL It Might as Well Be Spring COL performer VAL Laura Fygi	COL video title VAL Django Reinhardt - St.Louis Blues - 1935 September 30 - Decca\, Paris COL channel name VAL Heinz Becker COL description VAL Stéphane Grappelli and his Hot Four   Stéphane Grappelli (v); Django Reinhardt (g solo); Joseph Reinhardt\, Pierre "Baro" Ferret (g); Louis Vola (b)  1935 September 30 - Decca\, Paris   Grappelli might have been the leader on this date\, but Django is the soloist for all but the last minute of this record. For anyone of that time who was not aware of the guitarist\, the unaccompanied introduction might make them think that they were hearing a classical player. Yet\, as Django slides into a slow-walk tempo and the opening melody of "St. Louis Blues"\, there is no doubt that his heart lies in jazz. He makes effective use of bent notes in the opening chorus\, and his flashy but tasteful runs add dramatic contrast. When he goes to the tango section\, he adds to the drama with strong lines in parallel octaves. The tempo picks up as the band returns to the blues choruses\, and Reinhardt's final chorus is marked by block chords and one of his trademarked guitar rolls. When Grappelli enters\, Reinhardt steals the spotlight back with his unique accompanying style featuring choppy block chords and rolls at the turnarounds.	0

COL title VAL Ghost of a Chance COL performer VAL Bobby Timmons Trio	COL video title VAL Torero Band [Tijuana Christmas] Sound of Brass - Hark! The Herald Angels Sing [HQ Audio] COL channel name VAL choccystarfish1 COL description VAL Dance to your favourite Carols with the wonderful 'Sound of Brass' !  Oh the memories this provokes!  Hope some others of you had to endure this in your childhood!  [Sleeve notes]  Christmas is the most joyful festival of the Christian year\, when we celebrate at the same time the turning point of winter and the new hope that was brought to men with the birth of Jesus.  Christmas is a time when we make up for the bleakness of the weather outside with the warmth of our spirits and it is no coincidence that the songs which have become particularly associated with Christmas should be carols\, which have always been the most cheerful and often the most secular of Christian songs.  On this record you will find your favourite carols in an unfamiliar guise - we've called the album 'Tijuana Christmas'\, but you will hear the mariachi sound taking on a richer and more varied flavour as the Torero Band bring out the charms of our most beautiful carol tunes in imaginative brand new arrangements.  'The Holly & the Ivy' sets the pace with a bright\, sparkling beat that even adds to the gaiety of one of our oldest and liveliest carols; 'Silent Night' a much more recent and a more devout carol\, is given quite a contrasting treatment\, slow and tender.  'Hark! The Herald Angels Sing' sets off again at a brisk\, bouncy pace - and if you feel like dancing\, why not?  It may come as a surprise to you that our oldest carols used to be dances and that the word itself described a form of circular dance.

COL title VAL Rovin' Gambler COL performer VAL The New Christy Minstrels	COL video title VAL Billie Holiday - Georgia On My Mind (OKeh Records 1941) COL channel name VAL RoundMidnightTV COL description VAL "Georgia on My Mind" is a song written in 1930 by Hoagy Carmichael (music) and Stuart Gorrell (lyrics). It is the official state song of the U.S. state of Georgia. Gorrell wrote the lyrics for Hoagy's sister\, Georgia Carmichael. However\, the lyrics of the song are ambiguous enough to refer either to the state or to a woman named "Georgia". Carmichael's 1965 autobiography\, Sometimes I Wonder\, records the origin: a friend\, saxophonist and bandleader Frankie Trumbauer\, suggested: "Why don't you write a song called 'Georgia?' Nobody lost much writing about the South." Thus\, the song is universally believed to have been written about the state. The song was first recorded on September 15\, 1930 in New York by Hoagy Carmichael and His Orchestra with Bix Beiderbecke on muted cornet and Hoagy Carmichael on vocals. The recording was part of Bix Beiderbecke's last recording session. The recording was released as Victor 23013 with "One Night in Havana".  Billie's accompanied by Shad Collins tp; Leslie Johnakins\, Eddie Barefield as; Lester Young ts; Eddie Heywood p; John Collins g; Ted Sturgis b; Kenny Clarke ds.  Recorded in New York City\, March 21\, 1941. (OKeh Records)  Georgia  Georgia   The whole day through  Just an old sweet song   Keeps Georgia on my mind  Georgia  Georgia   A song of you  Comes as sweet and clear   As moonlight through the pines       Other arms reach out to me  Other eyes smile tenderly  Still in peaceful dreams I see   The road leads back to you       Georgia  Georgia   No peace I find  Just and old sweet song   Keeps Georgia on my mind    (bridge)    Georgia  Georgia   No peace I find  Just and old sweet song   Keeps Georgia on my mind	0

If we could talk to the animals\, learn their languages\, Maybe Take an animal degree\, I'd study elephant and eagle\, buffalo and beagle\, Alligator\, guinea pig\, and flea!  I would converse in polar bear and python\, And I would curse in fluent kangaroo\, If people ask me "can you speak rhinoceros?" I'd say "of courserous! Can't you?"  If I conferred with our furry friends\, man to animal\, Think of the amazing repartee If I could walk with the animals\, talk with the animals\, Grunt and squeak and squawk with the animals\, And they could squeak and skwawk and speak and talk to us!  If I consult with the quadrupeds Think what fun wed have\, asking for the crocodiles for tea! Or maybe lunch with three lions\, walruses and sea lions What a lovely place the world would be!  If I spoke slang to orangutans The advantages any fool on earth could plainly see! Discussing Eastern art and dramas With intellectual llamas Thats a big step forward youll agree!  Id learn to speak in antelope and turtle And my Pekinese would be extremely good If I were asked to sing in hippopotamus Id say whynotamous? and I would!  If I could parlay with pachyderms Its a fairy tale worthy of Hans Anderson and Grimm A man who walks with the animals and talks with the animals Grunts and squeaks and squawks with the animals and they could talk to *me*!   Id study every *living* creatures language So I could speak to all of them on site If friends said can he talk in crab or pelican? Youd say *like hell he can and you'll be right!  And if you just stop to think of it there's no doubt of it I would win a place in history If I could walk with the animals Talk with the animals Grunt no word here squeak and squawk with the animals And they could squeak and squawk and speak and talk to me!	0

Unfortunately\, BMG cut out some of Al's chatter between songs\, including his intro of the band\, so I edited in that part from an MP3 made from the original LP.	0

In December 1964 his orchestra released an album of cover versions of Themes from the James Bond Thrillers to coincide with the American release of Goldfinger. The popularity of Shaw's arrangements of Bond themes led to More Themes from the James Bond Thrillers for the release ofThunderball with tracks from both albums released on a UK album called James Bond in Action. In 1966 Shaw's orchestra performed Themes for Secret Agents.Themes from the James Bond Thrillers Vol.3/More James Bond in Action followed the release of Casino Royale and You Only Live Twice in 1967. Shaw came back in 1971 for The Return of James Bond/The Phase 4 World of Spy Thrillers for the release of Sean Connery's return as Bond in Diamonds Are Forever. Shaw recruited guitarist Vic Flick to repeat his guitar playing on the Gypsy Camp track.

COL title VAL Since I Fell for You COL performer VAL Kenny Burrell	COL video title VAL Mireille Mathieu - Que nadie sepa mi sufrir (La Foule) COL channel name VAL Cantando Tangos COL description VAL Una de las principales voces femeninas de Francia interpretando el valsesito de Dizeo y Cabral.  La Foule  El éxito internacional de"Que nadie sepa mi sufrir"originalmente compuesta por el argentino Ángel Cabral en 1936\, con letra de Enrique Dizeo en ritmo de vals criollo como se le conoce en Argentina\, comenzó en 1953\, en oportunidad de la presentación en el Teatro Ópera de Buenos Aires\, de  la cantante francesa Édith Piaf\, quien escucha una grabación de Alberto Castillo. Esta inolvidable intérprete escuchó el valsecito y se lo llevó a su país. Ya en París\, convocó al autor Michel Rivgauche\, quien le cambió la letra por completo y el título\, así nació La Foule\, que en francés significa La Multitud. La transformación resultó un éxito extraordinario desde que fue publicada en 1957.  La letra original está claramente destinada a ser cantada por un hombre que ha sido abandonado por su amante\, mientras que la canción de Edith Piaf mantiene la angustia en el contexto de una chica aturdida que conoce un hombre en medio de una multitud para perderlo casi de inmediato.  www.carlostangodj.com	0

In 1955\, the unique makeup of the group caught the attention of Atlantic Records  and the Sensations began a three year association with Atlantic's Atco subsidiary. The first two singles by the Sensations were old standards that were given major musical overhaul.    In November\, 1955 the Sensations first single "Yes Sir\, That's My Baby" was released and by February 18\, 1956 it had reached #15 on the R&B charts. On November 17\, 1955 they appeared at Philadelphia Town Hall with Ray Charles.  The follow up to "Ain't She Sweet" was released on April 14\, 1956 reaching #13 R&B in May. These were followed by "My Heart Cries For You\," "Little Wallflower\," "Kiddy Car Love\,"and "My Debut To Love."  When the Atco contract expired Yvonne retired to marry (Yvonne Baker) and raise a family.  In 1961\, Howell feeling that vocal groups were once again in demand convinced Baker to re-form the Sensations. Tenor Richard Curtain and baritone Sam Armstrong were added\, and the group convinced local Philadelphia disc jockey Kae Williams to manage them. William's arranged a record deal with Chess Record's Argo subsidiary. The Sensations recorded "Music\, Music\, Music" which reached #54 Pop and #12 R&B in the summer of 1961. It was their first R&B hit in five years and first Pop hit ever.  In the winter of 1961\, the Sensations  came out with the Baker written "Let Me In." "Let Me In" became their biggest hit reaching #2 Pop and #2 R&B in early 1962.  As so often happens after a major hit\, the Sensations couldn't record any follow up hits to sustain their momentum. "That's My Desire" made it to #69 in 1962 and there were two more Argo releases along with several on William's own Junior label. But nothing could bring the group back. Yvonne Baker latter attempted a solo career.  home.gif (2894 bytes)	0

COL title VAL There's No Business Like Show Business COL performer VAL Elaine Stritch	COL video title VAL Seventy Six Trombones - Henry Mancini and His Orchestra COL channel name VAL Lloyd T. COL description VAL Seventy-six Trombones is the signature song from the musical play The Music Man (1957)\, which was written by Meredith Willson. This song also appeared in the film The Music Man (1962)\, and in the made-for-TV movie adaptation in 2003. It is also a piece commonly played by marching and military bands. Seventy-six trombones led the big parade With a hundred and ten cornets close at hand ... In one of Willson's arrangements of the song\, it seamlessly integrates with other popular marches at the time\, such as Stars and Stripes Forever and The Washington Post March by John Philip Sousa (in whose band Willson had played)\, the The National Emblem March by Edwin Eugene Bagley\, the Swedish song Under the Blue and Yellow Flag by Viktor Widqvist\, and the song the Second Regiment\, Connecticut National Guard by D.W. Reeves. In the dramas\, "Professor" Harold Hill uses the song Seventy-six trombones to help the townspeople of the fictional town of River City\, Iowa\, visualize their children playing in a marching band by harkening back to a time when he saw several famous bandleaders' bands in a combined performance. Whereas an average-sized high school marching band might have about 10 musicians playing the trombone\, and a large college marching band seldom has more than 30 trombonists\, the band that Harold describes to the villagers included 76 trombones\, 110 cornets\, "over a thousand reeds"\, double bell euphoniums\, and "fifty mounted cannon" (which were popular in bands of the time). The love ballad Goodnight\, My Someone\, which immediately precedes Seventy-six Trombones in the musicals\, has the same tune but it is played in 3/4 metre - with a much slower tempo. In Willson's hometown of Mason City\, Iowa\, they honor this song (and the rest of the story of The Music Man) in a building called "Music Man Square"\, which is located next to Willson's boyhood home. In one large room\, they have 76 donated trombones hanging from the ceiling.	0

Official music video for the remake of "Cool Jerk" (here cleverly retitled "Cool Jerk '90") that was recorded for the Go-Go's 1990 Greatest Hits album (cleverly title 'Greatest').  The track was produced by frequent Prince collaborator David Z. who was fresh off having a U.S. number one hit with the Fine Young Cannibals "She Drives Me Crazy"\, however the producer's signature drum snare loop sound and highly produced style didn't really mesh well with the organic pop/rock sound the Go-Go's were known for and the single tanked upon release in the Fall of 1990.   Today\, the track is often looked at with much disdain by many Go-Go's fans (and most likely) some band members themselves. However\, the video is a treat in many ways...it does have a colorful\, slick feel to it that pops out at you\, and it IS entertaining to see some of the awkward dance moves the poor band members were forced to endure. While singer Belinda Carlisle seems most comfortable with this task\, poor Gina Schock is forced to dance the cool jerk AND bang the drum at the same time..and the result is pure entertainment GOLD.   Fun fact: The video version of this song is actually a 'remix' of the remixed/remade Cool Jerk ('90) that appears on the album 'Greatest'.	0

The embodiment of his hometown's freewheeling creative spirit and multiple musical traditions\, he's built a visionary\, idiosyncratic body of work that's deeply rooted in the Crescent City's myriad blues\, R&B\, jazz and rock 'n' roll traditions. So it's fitting that Dr. John's August 19\, 2014 release on Concord Records\, Ske-Dat-De-Dat...The Spirit Of Satch\, pays heartfelt tribute to another larger-than-life New Orleans legend: the seminal trumpeter and vocalist Louis "Satchmo" Armstrong\, whose musical innovations created the template for 20th-century jazz\, and whose playful attitude and life-embracing spirit made him a beloved figure whose worldwide appeal transcended music. "He's the most famous guy that ever came out of my neighborhood\," notes Dr. John. "He became a legend all over\, for his trumpet playin' and everything else\, and he was the United States' ambassador to the world."  Ske-Dat-De-Dat...The Spirit Of Satch honors Armstrong's musical genius as well as his effervescent personality with 13 quintessential numbers drawn from various phases of Armstrong's five-decade career\, with Dr. John joined by a stellar supporting cast that manages to update the material while maintaining the music's timeless emotional appeal. In addition to Dr. John's trademark vocals and piano\, and backup from some of New Orleans' finest musicians\, Ske-Dat-De-Dat…The Spirit Of Satch features a stellar assortment of guest singers and players. Bonnie Raitt shares the spotlight on a swinging reading of "I've Got the World on a String\," Ledisi and the McCrary Sisters lend gospel authority to "Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen\," Anthony Hamilton is featured on a mournful "Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child\," Shemekia Copeland trades verses with Dr. John on a playful reworking on "Sweet Hunk O' Trash\," and the Blind Boys of Alabama lend their powerful voices to "What a Wonderful World" and "Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams."   -uploaded in HD at http://www.TunesToTube.com	0

"Sittin' on Top of the World"\, recorded by Howlin' Wolf in 1957 (and published under his birth-name Chester Burnett)\, is a well-known and widely-used version of this song. This was the version recorded by Cream in 1968. Howlin' Wolf shortened the song to just three verses. The first and third verses are similar to the second and fifth verses of the Mississippi Sheiks' song. The middle verse of Howlin' Wolf's version -- "Worked all the summer\, worked all the fall / Had to take Christmas\, in my overalls" -- was an addition to the 1930 original\, but had previously appeared in a version recorded by Ray Charles in 1949.

COL title VAL 'Round Midnight COL performer VAL Andy and the Bey Sisters	COL video title VAL Julie London - Gone With The Wind (Liberty Records 1955) COL channel name VAL RoundMidnightTV COL description VAL "Gone with the Wind" is a popular song. The music was written by Allie Wrubel\, the lyrics by Herb Magidson. The song was published in 1937. A version recorded by Horace Heidt was a #1 song in 1937. Diane E. Holloway\, who has written extensively on American popular songs\, indicates that the title was inspired by the 1936 publication of the novel Gone with the Wind\, and the timing indicates that this is likely. But the lyrics have no connection to the subject matter of the novel\, and this song should not be confused with any of the music featured in the 1939 film adaptation.  Julie London (September 26\, 1926 – October 18\, 2000) was an American singer and actress\, whose career spanned more than 40 years. Born in Santa Rosa\, California to vaudevillian parents\, London was discovered while working as an elevator operator in downtown Los Angeles\, and began her career as an actress. London's 35-year acting career began in film in 1944\, and included roles as the female lead in numerous Westerns\, co-starring with Rock Hudson in The Fat Man (1951)\, with Robert Taylor and John Cassavetes in Saddle the Wind (1958)\, and opposite Robert Mitchum in The Wonderful Country (1959).  In the mid-1950s\, she signed a recording contract with the newly established Liberty Records\, and released a total of 32 albums of pop and jazz standards during the 1950s and 1960s\, with her signature song being "Cry Me a River"\, which she introduced in 1955. London was noted by critics for her husky\, smoky voice and languid vocal style. She released her final studio album in 1969\, but achieved continuing success playing the female starring role of Nurse Dixie McCall\, in the television series Emergency! (1972–79)\, in which she appeared opposite her real-life husband\, Bobby Troup. The show was produced by her ex-husband\, Jack Webb.  A shy and introverted woman\, London rarely granted interviews\, and spent the remainder of her life out of the public sphere. In 1995\, she suffered a stroke\, which left her with permanent health problems\, and died five years later of a heart attack.  Julie's accompanied by Ray Leatherwood (bass)\, and Barney Kessel (guitar).  Gone with the wind Gone like a leaf that has blown away Gone with the wind My romance has flown away  Yesterday's kisses are still on my lips  I had a lifetime of heaven at my fingertips   But now all is gone Gone is the rapture that thrilled my heart Gone with the wind Gone is the gladness that filled my heart  Just like a flame\, love burned brightly  Then became an empty smoke dream that has gone\,  Gone with the wind  Gone with the wind Gone with the wind Gone with the wind	0

COL title VAL The Holly and the Ivy COL performer VAL Manor House String Quartet	COL video title VAL Torero Band [Tijuana Christmas] Sound of Brass - The Holly & The Ivy [HQ Audio] COL channel name VAL choccystarfish1 COL description VAL Dance to your favourite Carols with the wonderful 'Sound of Brass' !  Oh the memories this provokes!  Hope some others of you had to endure this in your childhood!  [Sleeve notes]  Christmas is the most joyful festival of the Christian year\, when we celebrate at the same time the turning point of winter and the new hope that was brought to men with the birth of Jesus.  Christmas is a time when we make up for the bleakness of the weather outside with the warmth of our spirits and it is no coincidence that the songs which have become particularly associated with Christmas should be carols\, which have always been the most cheerful and often the most secular of Christian songs.  On this record you will find your favourite carols in an unfamiliar guise - we've called the album 'Tijuana Christmas'\, but you will hear the mariachi sound taking on a richer and more varied flavour as the Torero Band bring out the charms of our most beautiful carol tunes in imaginative brand new arrangements.  'The Holly & the Ivy' sets the pace with a bright\, sparkling beat that even adds to the gaiety of one of our oldest and liveliest carols; 'Silent Night' a much more recent and a more devout carol\, is given quite a contrasting treatment\, slow and tender.  'Hark! The Herald Angels Sing' sets off again at a brisk\, bouncy pace - and if you feel like dancing\, why not?  It may come as a surprise to you that our oldest carols used to be dances and that the word itself described a form of circular dance.  In the preface to the Oxford Book of Carols you will find carols described as songs with a religious impulse that are simple\, popular and modern.  You'll never have heard them sounding more joyful\, popular or modern than they do on this exciting and original LP. (Blase Machin)	1

COL title VAL When the Sun Comes Out COL performer VAL Lucy Ann Polk	COL video title VAL Ella Fitzgerald - No Other Love COL channel name VAL Alissa Lovera COL description VAL Talk about a rara avis -- for four decades\, Ella Sings Broadway has been the most obscure and hard to find of Ella Fitzgerald's classic Verve albums. Those who did invest the time and money in unearthing it were amply rewarded: The set is a perfect complement to Fitzgerald's classic series of Song Book albums. Unlike the Song Books\, however\, Ella Sings Broadway concentrates not on the time-honored history of The Great White Way and its stellar songwriters\, but on songs and shows by writers that were part of Broadway's recent past: Rodgers and Hammerstein (South Pacific\, Me and Juliet) Adler and Ross (Damn Yankees\, The Pajama Game)\, Frank Loesser (Guys and Dolls)\, and Lerner and Loewe (Brigadoon\, My Fair Lady).  This overlooked gem of an album was arranged and conducted by Marty Paich\, the man responsible for such other Fitzgerald triumphs as Ella Swings Brightly and Whisper Not -- which places Ella Sings Broadway in most excellent company.  www.vervemusicgroup.com	0

COL title VAL Jingle Bell Rock COL performer VAL Marty Robbins	COL video title VAL John Coltrane & Johnny Hartman - You are too beautiful COL channel name VAL funkmoses COL description VAL John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman is a 1963 studio album featuring John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman.  Though it is often reported that Coltrane and Hartman had known each other since their days playing with Dizzy Gillespie's band in the late 1940s\, the truth is that their time in the band never overlapped. Coltrane might have heard Hartman sing at a 1950 Apollo Theater performance at which they shared the stage Hartman is the only vocalist with whom the saxophonist would record as a leader. Initially when producer Bob Thiele approached Hartman with Coltrane's request that the two record together Hartman was hesitant as he did not consider himself a jazz singer and did not think he and Coltrane would complement one another musically. However\, Thiele encouraged Hartman to go see Coltrane perform at Birdland in New York to see if something could be worked out. Hartman did so\, and after the club closed he\, Coltrane\, and Coltrane's pianist McCoy Tyner\, went over some songs together. On March 7\, 1963 Coltrane and Hartman had decided on 10 songs for the record album\, but en route to the studio they heard Nat King Cole on the radio performing "Lush Life"\, and Hartman immediately decided that song had to be included in their album. The legendary compilation was made that same day at the Van Gelder Studio in Englewood Cliffs\, New Jersey. Hartman once said that each song was done in only one take\, except for "You Are Too Beautiful"\, which required two takes because Elvin Jones dropped one of his drumsticks during the first take. In 2005\, the raw tapes were reviewed by jazz archivist Barry Kernfeld who documented there were actually complete alternate takes for all six songs that he considered "absolutely riveting." Until clear ownership of these tapes is established between the Coltrane family and Universal Music\, there are no plans for their release. Produced by Bob Thiele\, the album became an instant jazz classic\, and the renditions of "Lush Life"\, "My One and Only Love"\, and "They Say It's Wonderful" are considered definitive.	0

The song is found on the finale number of the play's first act\, and performed by the character of Albin Mougeotte\, first played by George Hearn. The song was composed in 1983 by Jerry Herman\, an openly gay man.  The song has since been covered by the likes of Dame Shirley Bassey\, Gloria Gaynor\, Marti Webb\, Joannie Taylor\, Carol Jiani\, Amanda Lear\, Hannah Jones\, Soraya Arnelas\, Ken Page\, Gerard-Rene-Gordon\, Doug Shneider\, Teatro\, Linda Eder\, John Barrowman\, Amateur Transplants\, Karen Mulder and Anthony Warlow.  I Am What I Am was the only studio album recorded by Shirley Bassey for the Towerbell Records label\, several other tracks were also recorded at this label and issued as singles only. The recording sessions took place at Olympic Studios\, Barnes\, London\, in July and August 1984. Following the success of the previous album All by Myself this album peaked at number 25 in the UK album chart and reached Gold status.   This release was the first digitally recorded album made by Shirley Bassey and was issued on vinyl\, cassette and CD. Consisting of mainly re-recordings from Shirley Bassey's back catalogue and two new songs\, this album was recorded 'live' with The London Symphony Orchestra\, conducted by Carl Davies. The album also reunited Shirley Bassey with Norman Newell\, who had served successfully as her producer throughout the 1960s.  LYRICS: I am what I am I am my own special creation So come take a look Give me the hook or the ovation It's my world That I want to have a little pride in My world And it's not a place I have to hide in Life's not worth a damn Till you can say I am what I am  I am what I am I don't want praise I don't want pity I bang my own drum Some think it's noise I think it's pretty And so what if I love each sparkle and each bangle Why not try to see things from a different angle Your life is a sham Till you can shout out I am what I am  I am what I am And what I am needs no excuses I deal my own deck Sometimes the aces sometimes the deuces It's one life and there's no return and no deposit One life so it's time to open up your closet Life's not worth a damn till you can shout out I am what I am	0

The Creator / Macarthur Park first attempt  The first album Morgan recorded in Londons Pipe Studios (actually a TEAC 4-track recorder set up in his Notting Hill bedsit). This bizarre album was originally conceived (with the collusion of Iain McNay\, Cherry Reds boss) as a spoof compilation album featuring a variety of 'bands' from Peabody\, an obscure little town in Kansas (at that time American towns like Cleveland and Akron were viewed upon as hot-beds of modern rock music). When this concept was stated on the radio and in the press\, quite a number of people believed it! In truth\, it was all made by Morgan. The musical approach was to take songs and perform them in a way that was diametrically opposite to the original version. Here are the original artists who performed (or pre-formed) the songs\, and the styles adopted for these recordings:  1. Richard Harris in the style of The Specials or two-tone. 2. The Sex Pistols in the style of Pinky and Perky (a BBC TV childrens puppet show). 3. Kate Bush in the style of Jah Wobble and reggae/dub. 4. Perry Como in the style of The Sex Pistols and speed punk. 5. Peggy Lee - actually done in a contorted version of her own style. 6. The Brotherhood of Man in the style of Devo. 7. Rod Stewart in a new wave/techno style. 8. Sun Ra - actually an affectionate and slightly twisted version of his own style. 9. The Beatles collaged with a hint of "My Life In The Bush of Ghosts" (Eno/Byrne). 10. The Stranglers in the style of The Residents. 11. The Righteous Brothers in the style of Suicide. 12. Squeeze UK in the style of\, er\, The Residents meet Pink Floyd? Then a segue into Mott the Hoople in the style of an old 78rpm record by the Palm Court Orchestra.	0

COL title VAL Memphis in June COL performer VAL Hoagy Carmichael and Orchestra	COL video title VAL Francesco de gregori   acido seminterrato COL channel name VAL Gabriele Cordovani COL description VAL Acido seminterrato (traduzione italiana di Subterranean homesick blues)  Amore e Furto è un album di traduzioni in italiano di canzoni di Bob Dylan\, che celebra la reverente ammirazione di De Gregori per il cantautore statunitense. Alcuni brani dell'album\, in realtà\, erano già stati tradotti in italiano molti anni prima\, come Non dirle che non è così e Come il giorno.  Si tratta del secondo album completo di traduzioni di canzoni di Dylan pubblicato in Italia\, il primo fu nel 1987 Dylaniato di Tito Schipa Jr.  Gli arrangiamenti tendono a rispettare una certa fedeltà nei confronti delle versioni dell'autore originale. Riguardo agli arrangiamenti\, infatti\, il cantante romano dice che «sono talmente belli che sarebbe stupido andare a cambiare quello che ha fatto gente come Daniel Lanois o Mark Knopfler per quei brani; inoltre\, poiché nella traduzione inevitabilmente si perde qualcosa\, almeno negli arrangiamenti volevo essere più aderente. Tuttavia nelle parole e il ritmo\, la metrica ti impongono qualche cambiamento: c’è una ricerca della fedeltà che è sempre disattesa\, perché non si può tradurre per filo e per segno. Per mantenere la bellezza e la gradevolezza della canzoni qualche cambiamento va fatto per forza». L'armonica non viene mai suonata da De Gregori nel disco\, per non sovrapporre una parte sua a una di Dylan nella canzone originale.	0

COL title VAL When You Walk in the Room COL performer VAL Pam Tillis	COL video title VAL John Coltrane & Johnny Hartman - You are too beautiful COL channel name VAL funkmoses COL description VAL John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman is a 1963 studio album featuring John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman.  Though it is often reported that Coltrane and Hartman had known each other since their days playing with Dizzy Gillespie's band in the late 1940s\, the truth is that their time in the band never overlapped. Coltrane might have heard Hartman sing at a 1950 Apollo Theater performance at which they shared the stage Hartman is the only vocalist with whom the saxophonist would record as a leader. Initially when producer Bob Thiele approached Hartman with Coltrane's request that the two record together Hartman was hesitant as he did not consider himself a jazz singer and did not think he and Coltrane would complement one another musically. However\, Thiele encouraged Hartman to go see Coltrane perform at Birdland in New York to see if something could be worked out. Hartman did so\, and after the club closed he\, Coltrane\, and Coltrane's pianist McCoy Tyner\, went over some songs together. On March 7\, 1963 Coltrane and Hartman had decided on 10 songs for the record album\, but en route to the studio they heard Nat King Cole on the radio performing "Lush Life"\, and Hartman immediately decided that song had to be included in their album. The legendary compilation was made that same day at the Van Gelder Studio in Englewood Cliffs\, New Jersey. Hartman once said that each song was done in only one take\, except for "You Are Too Beautiful"\, which required two takes because Elvin Jones dropped one of his drumsticks during the first take. In 2005\, the raw tapes were reviewed by jazz archivist Barry Kernfeld who documented there were actually complete alternate takes for all six songs that he considered "absolutely riveting." Until clear ownership of these tapes is established between the Coltrane family and Universal Music\, there are no plans for their release. Produced by Bob Thiele\, the album became an instant jazz classic\, and the renditions of "Lush Life"\, "My One and Only Love"\, and "They Say It's Wonderful" are considered definitive.	0

COL title VAL I'm Glad There Is You COL performer VAL Lena Horne	COL video title VAL Lorez Alexandria -- I'm Glad There Is You (1957) COL channel name VAL JazzyRNA COL description VAL Continuing with saga of America's most gifted\, and underrated jazz vocalists—this particular artist takes the cake—not meaning the particular term in a negative connotation\, but it's such a pity that a remarkable songstress—the incomparable\, Lorez Alexandria is not afforded the recognition that she so deserves. This is proven true\, given the fact that I recently discovered her albums—and I just haven't had my fill. I've searched and purchased everything I could find from such a gifted songstress. Lorez crafts each lyric with such grace and tonality that could easily match (if not surpass) the reigning jazz stylists of the bop/jazz/pop age. She gives each standard a new sense of evocative meaning as far as lyrics are concerned\, and reinvents the wheel each time she unleashes her enthralling voice. As she once said "A lyric is dead\, until you breathe life into it." This is exactly what she does. Enjoy and listen in HD\, to the lovely—Lorez Alexandria. All right(s) to 1957 King Records\, Inc	1

COL title VAL If You Are but a Dream COL performer VAL Damita Jo	COL video title VAL Nat King Cole - Wouldn't It Be Loverly COL channel name VAL uschisfly COL description VAL "...I started out to become a jazz pianist; in the meantime I started singing and I sang the way I felt and that's just the way it came out."  Nathaniel Adams Coles (March 17\, 1919 -- February 15\, 1965)\, known professionally as Nat King Cole\, was an American musician who first came to prominence as a leading jazz pianist. He owes most of his popular musical fame to his soft baritone voice\, which he used to perform in big band and jazz genres. He was one of the first black Americans to host a television variety show\, and has maintained worldwide popularity since his death.  Cole was a smoker of Kool menthol cigarettes\, believing that smoking up to three packs a day gave his voice its rich sound (Cole would smoke several cigarettes in rapid succession before a recording). He died from lung cancer on February 15\, 1965\, at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica\, California.  One of the last albums Nat recorded prior to his death was a collection of songs from Lerner & Lowe's "My Fair Lady" as a tribute to the enthusiasm his fans showed whenever he toured England. "Wouldn't It Be Loverly" was recorded on Sep\, 17\, 1963.  Lyrics: All I want is a room somewhere Far away from the cold night air With one enormous chair Oh\, wouldn't it be loverly?  Lots of chocolate for me to eat Lots of coal makin' lots of heat Warm face\, warm hands\, warm feet Oh\, wouldn't it be loverly?  Oh so loverly sittin' abso-bloomin'-lutely still I would never budge till Spring crept over mi window sill  Someone's head restin' on my knee Warm and tender as he can be Who takes good care of me Oh\, wouldn't it be loverly?  Oh so loverly sittin' abso-bloomin'-lutely still I would never budge till Spring crept over mi window sill  Someone's head restin' on my knee Warm and tender as he can be Who takes good care of me Oh\, wouldn't it be loverly?

COL title VAL Please Come to Boston COL performer VAL Glen Campbell	COL video title VAL 'Ah Leu Cha' Tony Purrone\, Eddie Gomez\, Lenny White COL channel name VAL lemmingthought COL description VAL by Charlie Parker  Tony Purrone\, guitar Eddie Gomez\, bass Lenny White\, drums  From the album 'Set 'em Up\,' 8/01/96\, Steeplechase http://www.amazon.com/Set-Em-Up/dp/B002RAZ4IY/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&s=dmusic&qid=1320018143&sr=1-12  From the All Music Guide:       Purrone's high-velocity picking and his solid-body instrument are not exactly the stuff of a jazz guitar traditionalist\, despite the acoustic jazz thrust of this and subsequent recordings. While Purrone displays straight-ahead smarts on "How Deep Is The Ocean" and "Ah Leu Cha\," he's equally able to venture into post-bop territory where few guitarists tread\, at least not in a trio setting. On Wayne Shorter's "Toy Tune" and Herbie Hancock's "Sorceror\," for instance\, Purrone succeeds in conveying the harmonic complexity of the music despite the inherent orchestral limitations of his instrument.

Among other tracks\, the album featured Davis' interpretations of two contemporary pop songs: Cyndi Laupers "Time After Time" and Michael Jacksons "Human Natute".  During the recording sessions\, Darryl Jones (A/K/A "The Munch:" Bass) introduced Sting to his longtime idol Miles Davis. Sting was startled when Davis asked him if he could speak French\, and since he did\, to translate the Miranda Warning into French and yell it into the microphone against a backing track.  Miranda Warning is a warning given by police in the United States to criminal suspects in police custody\, or in a custodial situation\, before they are interrogated : You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney\, one will be appointed to you. Do you understand these rights as they have been read to you?  The Miranda warnings were mandated by the 1966 United States Supreme Court decision in the case of Miranda v. Arizona as a means of protecting a criminal suspect's Fifth Amendment right to avoid coercive self-incrimination (see right to silence). The reading of the Miranda warning might be omitted during arrest\, such as if the evidence is already sufficient to indict\, or if the suspect is talkative and volunteers information (without being asked). The admissibility of conversations\, as evidence\, is judged on a case-by-case basis\, subject to appeal.	1

COL title VAL St. Louis Blues COL performer VAL Stephane Grappelly and His Hot Four	COL video title VAL Francesco de gregori   acido seminterrato COL channel name VAL Gabriele Cordovani COL description VAL Acido seminterrato (traduzione italiana di Subterranean homesick blues)  Amore e Furto è un album di traduzioni in italiano di canzoni di Bob Dylan\, che celebra la reverente ammirazione di De Gregori per il cantautore statunitense. Alcuni brani dell'album\, in realtà\, erano già stati tradotti in italiano molti anni prima\, come Non dirle che non è così e Come il giorno.  Si tratta del secondo album completo di traduzioni di canzoni di Dylan pubblicato in Italia\, il primo fu nel 1987 Dylaniato di Tito Schipa Jr.  Gli arrangiamenti tendono a rispettare una certa fedeltà nei confronti delle versioni dell'autore originale. Riguardo agli arrangiamenti\, infatti\, il cantante romano dice che «sono talmente belli che sarebbe stupido andare a cambiare quello che ha fatto gente come Daniel Lanois o Mark Knopfler per quei brani; inoltre\, poiché nella traduzione inevitabilmente si perde qualcosa\, almeno negli arrangiamenti volevo essere più aderente. Tuttavia nelle parole e il ritmo\, la metrica ti impongono qualche cambiamento: c’è una ricerca della fedeltà che è sempre disattesa\, perché non si può tradurre per filo e per segno. Per mantenere la bellezza e la gradevolezza della canzoni qualche cambiamento va fatto per forza». L'armonica non viene mai suonata da De Gregori nel disco\, per non sovrapporre una parte sua a una di Dylan nella canzone originale.	0

Other members of the DSC in Bob's quartet are bassist Henk Bosch van Drakensteyn and drummer Huub Janssen. It would not be possible without an excellent pianist. His name is Marcel Hendricks. For this broadcast recorded in Restaurant-Pub de Boerenhofstede in the small town in Laren Holland they had a special guest\, Dani Dorice on vibraphone from France. Of course we all know the talent and fame of the Benny Goodman Quartet from a generation before but here is a group that every Dutchman should be proud of. These musicians swing just as confident and with the same talented skills as these former giants.  Now in 2007 Bob Kaper is the leader of the Dutch Swing College band and Marcel Hendricks its pianist.	0

In December 1964 his orchestra released an album of cover versions of Themes from the James Bond Thrillers to coincide with the American release of Goldfinger. The popularity of Shaw's arrangements of Bond themes led to More Themes from the James Bond Thrillers for the release ofThunderball with tracks from both albums released on a UK album called James Bond in Action. In 1966 Shaw's orchestra performed Themes for Secret Agents.Themes from the James Bond Thrillers Vol.3/More James Bond in Action followed the release of Casino Royale and You Only Live Twice in 1967. Shaw came back in 1971 for The Return of James Bond/The Phase 4 World of Spy Thrillers for the release of Sean Connery's return as Bond in Diamonds Are Forever. Shaw recruited guitarist Vic Flick to repeat his guitar playing on the Gypsy Camp track.

COL title VAL Fever COL performer VAL Shirley Horn	COL video title VAL Rosemary Clooney & Perez Prado - You Do Something To Me (VintageMusic.es) COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Rosemary Clooney\, disfrutó durante la década de los cincuenta de una extraordinaria fama con canciones absolutamente mediocres. De la mano de Mitch Miller\, director artístico de la casa Columbia\, aplicó el inexorable principio de que\, cuantos peores eran los arreglos y las letras de los temas\, mas beneficio económico para la discográfica. onsiguió grabar un par de duets con Frank Sinatra en 1950 y a partir de ahí le sobrevino la fama y la popularidad. Tuvo su propio show televisivo e incluso Hollywood llamó a su puerta para que participara junto a Bing Crosby y Danny Kaye en algunas comedias musicales siendo la mas celebre el film de Michael Curtiz\, "White Christmas".No obstante lo dicho\, Rosemary Clooney\, se acercó tardíamente al jazz y grabó una par de magníficos álbumes para Columbia: "The Best Of Hollywood" con la orquesta del trompetista\, Harry James\, y "Blue Rose"\, su obra mas conseguida y un disco que pudo ser memorable con la orquesta de Duke Ellington. Es la tía sanguínea del actual actor George Clooney.  Dámaso Pérez Prado (Matanzas\, Cuba\, 11 de diciembre de 1916 - Ciudad de México\, 14 de septiembre de 1989)\, el "Rey del Mambo"\, fue un músico\, compositor y arreglista cubano.Dámaso Pérez Prado es mayormente conocido por sus aportes al género del mambo\, que tiene sus orígenes en el danzón cubano y daría pauta al surgimiento y desarrollo del chachachá.Pasado el clímax del mambo\, es llamativo que Dámaso Pérez Prado\, una vez compuesta su pieza musical "Patricia" y obtenido su éxito correspondiente\, la grabase muchas veces y con diferentes arreglos\, actitud que parece demostrar que tuvo por dicha pieza una especial predilección. Entre sus composiciones más conocidas se encuentran Qué rico el mambo y Mambo Nº 5\, ésta última después lanzada en una nueva versión en 1999 por el cantante alemán Lou Bega.

Randazzo\, a childhood friend of the group\, wrote the song especially for them\, having also supplied the group with their previous Top 20 Hit "I'm on the Outside (Looking In)". Their original version of the song was a Billboard Top 10 Pop hit\, reaching #6 on the Billboard Hot 100\, and #1 in the Canadian RPM-list in 1965. The song peaked at #8 on Cashbox magazine's R&B chart (Billboard was in a chart recess for R&B listings at that time). The Little Anthony & the Imperials original recording is the most commonly known version of the song\, and the definitive version\, although it's since been covered by many other artists.

COL title VAL At Last COL performer VAL Etta James	COL video title VAL AT LAST ~ Charlie Spivak & His Orchestra (1942) COL channel name VAL MrRJDB1969 COL description VAL "At Last" ~ Charlie Spivak & His Orchestra w/ Garry Stevens & The Stardusters  (1942)  Columbia Records #36642 Flip side of\, "People Like You And Me"   Charlie Spivak was often billed as "The Sweetest Trumpet In The World" . In my opinion\, Spivak\, Harry James\, & Billy Butterfield & a few others\, were probably some of the best "sweet" trumpet players to come out of the "Big Band Era" .  He started out in the early 1920's and by the time he formed his orchestra in 1939\, he had already played with such orchestra's fronted by \, Paul Specht\, Ben Pollack\, The Dorsey Brother's\, Bob Crosby\,  Tommy Dorsey\, & Jack Teagarden.  The Stardusters \, consisting of Glen Gaylon\, Curt Purnell\, & Dick Wylder started out as a trio while still in high school and upon graduation \, they decided to follow their dreams of a vocal career\, instead of attending Yale.  By 1939 and after several guest appearances\, they landed their very own radio program on NBC.  June Hutton \, Ina Ray Hutton's younger sister and once member of The Quintones vocal group\,   joined the original Stardusters in approx. 1940 and the group was complete.  They recorded WHEN I SEE AN ELEPHANT FLY\, AT LAST\, I SURRENDER DEAR\, A WEEKEND IN HAVANA\, THIS IS NO LAUGHING MATTER\, BROTHER BILL\, &  I REMEMBER YOU and a few others with Charlie Spivak's Orchestra. They later recorded with several popular vocalists of the day\, including  Evelyn Knight\, with whom they recorded the 1949 hit \, A LITTLE BIRD TOLD ME.	1

By maintaining its existence over such an extended period of time\, the group became to classic bluegrass what combos such as the Drifters or the Coasters are to rhythm & blues and doo-wop\, although the mountain music genre seems to have inspired a trifle less franchising and band-cloning.  The band was recorded in 1958 by Alan Lomax\, out on one of his many music gathering and recording explorations.

Other members of the DSC in Bob's quartet are bassist Henk Bosch van Drakensteyn and drummer Huub Janssen. It would not be possible without an excellent pianist. His name is Marcel Hendricks. For this broadcast recorded in Restaurant-Pub de Boerenhofstede in the small town in Laren Holland they had a special guest\, Dani Dorice on vibraphone from France. Of course we all know the talent and fame of the Benny Goodman Quartet from a generation before but here is a group that every Dutchman should be proud of. These musicians swing just as confident and with the same talented skills as these former giants.  Now in 2007 Bob Kaper is the leader of the Dutch Swing College band and Marcel Hendricks its pianist.	0
COL title VAL Embraceable You COL performer VAL Ginger Rogers & Allen Kearns	COL video title VAL John Pizzarelli: Maybe I'm Amazed COL channel name VAL Concord Records COL description VAL Signed CD for $10: http://kingsroadmerch.com/john-pizzarelli Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/JohnPizzarelliOfficial John's Website: http://www.johnpizzarelli.com/  WORLD-RENOWNED GUITARIST AND SINGER JOHN PIZZARELLI PERFORMS REPERTOIRE FROM PAUL McCARTNEY’S RICH MUSICAL CATALOG  Paul McCartney had a great idea for an album. He just needed the world-renowned guitarist and singer John Pizzarelli to make it.  “I got an idea got in my head\,” McCartney wrote to Pizzarelli in late May 2014.  “It might be interesting for you to do a few of my songs that are lesser known than some of the others. I realize this may be a little immodest\, if not pushy.” “I imagine the songs would include post-Beatles melodies of mine like ‘Love in the Open Air’ (from the soundtrack to 1967 film The Family Way)\, ‘Junk\,’ ‘Warm and Beautiful’ and\, possibly\, ‘My Valentine.’”  “My Valentine” was the one McCartney composition on his album of songs from the '30s and '40s\, Kisses on the Bottom (MPL/Hear Music/Concord). Pizzarelli played guitar on the album and backed Sir Paul on a handful of prestigious live performances\, including the GRAMMY Awards\, MusiCares Person of the Year gala and the initial iTunes/Apple TV live broadcast. Hailed as one of the prime contemporary interpreters of the Great American Songbook\, Pizzarelli has expanded his repertoire by performing the music of Joni Mitchell\, Neil Young\, Tom Waits\, Antônio Carlos Jobim and Lennon-McCartney.  McCartney concluded in his letter\, “The attraction for me is lesser-known tunes done in a mellow jazz style and\, if it gets some traction\, maybe the album could be titled Midnight McCartney. As I said\, this may tickle your fancy or you may decide these are the ramblings of a deranged composer with too much time on his hands.”  To say Pizzarelli was tickled is putting it mildly.	0

Son nom est souvent associé à celui du parolier Hal David. Ils ont produit une œuvre considérable et reconnue qui fait du tandem Bacharach et David deux des plus grands compositeurs de la musique populaire américaine des années 1960 aux années 2000.  Burt Bacharach (Kansas City\, Missouri\, 12 de maio de 1928) é um pianista e compositor norte-americano. Nos anos 50 e começo dos 60 ele foi o pianista e maestro de Marlene Dietrich.

Mai 1928 in Kansas City\, Missouri) ist ein US-amerikanischer Pianist und Komponist. Seit 1957 gehört er zu den erfolgreichsten Komponisten Amerikas\, rund 130 seiner Werke haben die Single-Charts seiner Heimat erreicht.  Ein Großteil seiner Lieder entstand in langjähriger Zusammenarbeit mit dem Texter Hal David und im Anschluss daran mit Carole Bayer Sager. Besonders erfolgreich waren die mit David in den 1960er und 1970er Jahren verfassten Songs für Dionne Warwick.  Für seine Leistungen erhielt Bacharach so gut wie alle wichtigen Preise der Entertainmentindustrie\, darunter mehrere Grammys\, Oscars und Golden Globes.

COL title VAL September in the Rain COL performer VAL Erich Kunzel\, Cincinnati Pops "Big Band" Orchestra	COL video title VAL Ray Stevens - Yakety Yak COL channel name VAL raystevensbigfan COL description VAL "Yakety Yak" is from the album called Gitarzan was Rays' fourth studio album\, released in 1969\, as well as his second for Monument Records. Unlike his previous album\, Even Stevens\, this album is completely in the genres of novelty and comedy.   Although this is a true studio album\, all of the songs are overdubbed with cheering and applauding of an audience to provide the feeling of a live album. Cover versions include three of the Coasters' hits ("Yakety Yak\," "Little Egypt" and "Along Came Jones")\, "Mr. Custer\," and "Alley Oop." The album also contains re-recordings of his two novelty hits\, "Harry the Hairy Ape" and "Ahab the Arab." "Freddie Feelgood (And His Funky Little Five Piece Band)" makes its first appearance on an album but is overdubbed with audience noises for this album.  Aside from "Freddie Feelgood\," two singles were lifted from this album: the title track (which tells a bizarre story about Tarzan and Jane and Cheetah forming a music band) and "Along Came Jones". The album version of the former begins with cheers and applause from an audience while the single version does not.  On July 2\, 1996\, Varèse Sarabande rereleased this album on CD and included three bonus tracks\, all three of which were singles after the release of this album: "The Streak\," "The Moonlight Special\," and "Bridget the Midget (The Queen of the Blues)."	0
COL title VAL God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen COL performer VAL Beckah Shae	COL video title VAL Torero Band [Tijuana Christmas] Sound of Brass - Hark! The Herald Angels Sing [HQ Audio] COL channel name VAL choccystarfish1 COL description VAL Dance to your favourite Carols with the wonderful 'Sound of Brass' !  Oh the memories this provokes!  Hope some others of you had to endure this in your childhood!  [Sleeve notes]  Christmas is the most joyful festival of the Christian year\, when we celebrate at the same time the turning point of winter and the new hope that was brought to men with the birth of Jesus.  Christmas is a time when we make up for the bleakness of the weather outside with the warmth of our spirits and it is no coincidence that the songs which have become particularly associated with Christmas should be carols\, which have always been the most cheerful and often the most secular of Christian songs.  On this record you will find your favourite carols in an unfamiliar guise - we've called the album 'Tijuana Christmas'\, but you will hear the mariachi sound taking on a richer and more varied flavour as the Torero Band bring out the charms of our most beautiful carol tunes in imaginative brand new arrangements.  'The Holly & the Ivy' sets the pace with a bright\, sparkling beat that even adds to the gaiety of one of our oldest and liveliest carols; 'Silent Night' a much more recent and a more devout carol\, is given quite a contrasting treatment\, slow and tender.  'Hark! The Herald Angels Sing' sets off again at a brisk\, bouncy pace - and if you feel like dancing\, why not?  It may come as a surprise to you that our oldest carols used to be dances and that the word itself described a form of circular dance.  In the preface to the Oxford Book of Carols you will find carols described as songs with a religious impulse that are simple\, popular and modern.  You'll never have heard them sounding more joyful\, popular or modern than they do on this exciting and original LP. (Blase Machin)	0

He testified (under oath) & denied being homosexual (or ever taken part in homosexual practices) in a 1956 defamation trial against the Daily Mirror. He further won a libel suit (1957) against Confidential Magazine for publishing a malicious article alluding to him being a homosexual. In Liberace's biography 'The Wonderful 'Private' World of Liberace' there is no mention of him being homosexual\, engaging in homosexual practices\, or an affair with Scott Thorson???

Written by Jimmy Kennedy and Michael Carr.  SOUTH OF THE BORDER  South of the border\, down Mexico way\, That's where I fell in love When the stars above came out to play. And now as I wander\, my thoughts ever stray South of the border\, down Mexico way.  She was a picture in old Spanish lace. And for a tender while I kissed the smile upon her face. For it was fiesta\, and we were so gay South of the border\, Mexico way.  Then she sighed as she whispered 'manana' Never dreaming that we were parting. And I lied as I whispered 'manana' For our tomorrow never came.  South of the border\, I rode back one day There in a veil of white by candlelight She knelt to pray. The mission bells told me that I mustn't stay South of the border\, down Mexico way.  Ai-ai-ai-ai (ai-ai-ai-ai) Ai-ai-ai-ai (ai-ai-ai-ai) Ai-ai-ai-ai ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  From Wiki:  "South of the Border" is a popular song describing a trip to Mexico\, written by Jimmy Kennedy and Michael Carr and published in 1939 for the film of the same name starring country star Gene Autry.[1]  In the lyrics\, a man looks back with regret and pain for having lied to the woman he can't forget ("...and now as I wander\, my thoughts ever stray...") and returned for too late\, just as she was preparing for marriage. The lyric is in juxtaposition with the music\, which swings with syncopated joy.  The song was a hit in 1939 for Shep Fields\, vocal by Hal Derwin. It has been recorded by many artists\, but the best-known versions are by Autry and Frank Sinatra (1953). The song was recorded in August 1961 by Patsy Cline for her album Patsy Cline Showcase and appears on Herb Alpert's 1964 album South of the Border.	0

Considerati dei ragazzini prodigio\, iniziarono la loro attività concertistica giovanissimi. Prima ancora di ottenere la laurea iniziarono l'attività in duo che portarono avanti assieme per tutta la loro vita. Nel 1947 intrapresero una carriera concertistica a tempo pieno\, prima nei night club\, poi in esibizioni di musica classica con orchestra al seguito. Tra il 1950 e il 1980 furono tra i principali artisti easy listening d'America e ottennero numerosi successi discografici. Fra i loro maggiori successi si possono citare: "Theme From The Apartment"\, "Exodus"\, "Tonight" e "Midnight Cowboy". Essi realizzarono frequenti registrazioni con le maggiori orchestre pop tra le quali si ricordano quelle dirette da George Gershwin\, Jerome Kern\, Cole Porter\, Richard Rodgers ed altre ancora.   ------------------------------------------------------------ Ferrante & Teicher was een Amerikaans pianoduo . Zij waren vooral bekend om hun arrangement van bekende klassieke en filmmuziek.  Arthur Ferrante (New York City\, 7 september - 1921 - 19 september 2009) en Louis Teicher (Wilkes Barre\, 24 augustus 1924 - 3 augustus 2008) leerden elkaar kennen toen zij studeerden aan de "Juilliard School" voor muziek in New York. Beiden waren muzikaal zeer begaafd en begonnen als pianoduo op te treden\, toen ze nog op school zaten. Na hun afstuderen gingen beiden aan de slag aan de Juilliard-faculteit.  In 1947 begonnen zij een voltijdse concertcarrière. Ze speelden eerst in nachtclubs\, maar schakelden al snel over naar het spelen van klassieke muziek met orkestbegeleiding. Tussen 1950 en 1980 waren zij een der belangrijkste Amerikaanse "easy listening"-groepen en scoorden zij vier grote hits: "Theme From The Apartment" (Pop #10)\, "Exodus" (Pop #2)\, "Tonight" (Pop #8)\, and "Midnight Cowboy" (Pop #10). Zij traden op en namen platen op met nummers van George Gershwin\, Jerome Kern\, Cole Porter en Richard Rodgers. In 1973 speelden zij het openingsnummer van het radiodrama The Zero Hour van Rod Sterling. Het duo deed ook aan "avant garde".	0

COL title VAL The House of the Rising Sun COL performer VAL The Ventures	COL video title VAL The Kirby Stone Four (1958) - Baubles\, Bangles And Beads COL channel name VAL NBCRecords COL description VAL Born in New York City on April 27\, 1918\, Kirby (whose real name was Herbert)\, formed Herby Stone And His Pebbles shortly after the end of WWII\, which by 1947 had evolved into The Kirby Stone Quintette (later shortened to Quintet). The line-up consisted of Kirby (trumpet)\, Art Cow Eyes Engler (saxophone)\, Michael Gardner (piano)\, Bernie Doc Mandel (bass) and Gene Thaler (later replaced by Eddie Hall) (drums). Within a few short years\, the group had become a four piece featuring Kirby\, Michael\, Eddie and first rate impressionist Larry Foster. The Quintet had become a Quartet and then simply a Four\, and it was with this line-up that Kirby found his greatest success\, including a Grammy nomination in 1958 for the song Baubles\, Bangles And Beads (taken from Kismet).   Although the group re-recorded the song in 1964\, and again in 1968\, it is the 1958 version\, issued on the Columbia label\, that shows the group at its peak (and is regarded by many as the ultimate version of this Wright & Forrest classic).   As well as recording\, The Kirby Stone Four appeared on television and in nightclubs across the USA (including their own Kirby Stone Fourum club in New York City)\, and toured overseas.  In the latter half of the 1960s\, Larry left the group to once more pursue a solo career as an impressionist\, and he was replaced by Jimmy Hassell. However\, this line-up was fairly short-lived\, and by the end of the decade the Kirby Stone Four had disbanded. Kirby\, however\, continued touring and recording into the 1970s\, with Kirby Stone & The Ethnic Family and The Kirby Stone Company. He passed away on July 13\, 1981\, aged 63.  This clip features a chronological history of Kirby\, the groups he led\, and the recordings he made. Enjoy!	0

COL title VAL Ik wol dy op sa'n dei noch net by my wei COL performer VAL Gerbrich van Dekken	COL video title VAL Al Stewart - Pink Panther Theme [Live] COL channel name VAL You Can't Download Vinyl COL description VAL Originally recorded November 24\, 1978 at the studios of WKQX in Chicago for their "Live Studio Jam" program\, during Al Stewart's "Time Passages" tour. Arista pressed 2500 copies of the original LP "for Promotional Use Only."   Eventually some of the songs from this LP found their way onto CD re-releases of Al's albums as "bonus tracks\," and finally the (almost) complete "Blue Album" was released on CD in 2002 by BMG as "Time Passages Live."  Unfortunately\, BMG cut out some of Al's chatter between songs\, including his intro of the band\, so I edited in that part from an MP3 made from the original LP.	0
COL title VAL For Your Love COL performer VAL Joe Tex	COL video title VAL United We Stand - Brotherhood of Man COL channel name VAL Julie Oliverio COL description VAL Brotherhood of Man and The New Seekers are among a handful of 70s pop-folk artists who were very effective in utilizing full choral harmonies in their sound to evoke the sense of togetherness and oneness characteristic of the era.  This is United We Stand by Euro-pop group Brotherhood of Man\, who ran the top of the British pop charts several times from 1970 to 1976\, but only achieved American radio play with this LP.  Frankly\, this song just melts me.  It's corny\, it's idealistic\, it's lyrics are simple but it's melodies are gorgeous\, and the original members here (Tony Hillard\, Tony Burrows\, Sunny Leslie and Sue Glover) are earnest and true in their presentation.  Like most choral pop groups\, the band would endure an endless shuffle of members\, and by 1976 none of the original four remained\, but the innocence\, optimism and sweetness of this track always will.	0

COL title VAL My Funny Valentine COL performer VAL John Nicol	COL video title VAL John Coltrane & Johnny Hartman - You are too beautiful COL channel name VAL funkmoses COL description VAL John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman is a 1963 studio album featuring John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman.  Though it is often reported that Coltrane and Hartman had known each other since their days playing with Dizzy Gillespie's band in the late 1940s\, the truth is that their time in the band never overlapped. Coltrane might have heard Hartman sing at a 1950 Apollo Theater performance at which they shared the stage Hartman is the only vocalist with whom the saxophonist would record as a leader. Initially when producer Bob Thiele approached Hartman with Coltrane's request that the two record together Hartman was hesitant as he did not consider himself a jazz singer and did not think he and Coltrane would complement one another musically. However\, Thiele encouraged Hartman to go see Coltrane perform at Birdland in New York to see if something could be worked out. Hartman did so\, and after the club closed he\, Coltrane\, and Coltrane's pianist McCoy Tyner\, went over some songs together. On March 7\, 1963 Coltrane and Hartman had decided on 10 songs for the record album\, but en route to the studio they heard Nat King Cole on the radio performing "Lush Life"\, and Hartman immediately decided that song had to be included in their album. The legendary compilation was made that same day at the Van Gelder Studio in Englewood Cliffs\, New Jersey. Hartman once said that each song was done in only one take\, except for "You Are Too Beautiful"\, which required two takes because Elvin Jones dropped one of his drumsticks during the first take. In 2005\, the raw tapes were reviewed by jazz archivist Barry Kernfeld who documented there were actually complete alternate takes for all six songs that he considered "absolutely riveting." Until clear ownership of these tapes is established between the Coltrane family and Universal Music\, there are no plans for their release. Produced by Bob Thiele\, the album became an instant jazz classic\, and the renditions of "Lush Life"\, "My One and Only Love"\, and "They Say It's Wonderful" are considered definitive.	0

The embodiment of his hometown's freewheeling creative spirit and multiple musical traditions\, he's built a visionary\, idiosyncratic body of work that's deeply rooted in the Crescent City's myriad blues\, R&B\, jazz and rock 'n' roll traditions. So it's fitting that Dr. John's August 19\, 2014 release on Concord Records\, Ske-Dat-De-Dat...The Spirit Of Satch\, pays heartfelt tribute to another larger-than-life New Orleans legend: the seminal trumpeter and vocalist Louis "Satchmo" Armstrong\, whose musical innovations created the template for 20th-century jazz\, and whose playful attitude and life-embracing spirit made him a beloved figure whose worldwide appeal transcended music. "He's the most famous guy that ever came out of my neighborhood\," notes Dr. John. "He became a legend all over\, for his trumpet playin' and everything else\, and he was the United States' ambassador to the world."  Ske-Dat-De-Dat...The Spirit Of Satch honors Armstrong's musical genius as well as his effervescent personality with 13 quintessential numbers drawn from various phases of Armstrong's five-decade career\, with Dr. John joined by a stellar supporting cast that manages to update the material while maintaining the music's timeless emotional appeal. In addition to Dr. John's trademark vocals and piano\, and backup from some of New Orleans' finest musicians\, Ske-Dat-De-Dat…The Spirit Of Satch features a stellar assortment of guest singers and players. Bonnie Raitt shares the spotlight on a swinging reading of "I've Got the World on a String\," Ledisi and the McCrary Sisters lend gospel authority to "Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen\," Anthony Hamilton is featured on a mournful "Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child\," Shemekia Copeland trades verses with Dr. John on a playful reworking on "Sweet Hunk O' Trash\," and the Blind Boys of Alabama lend their powerful voices to "What a Wonderful World" and "Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams."   -uploaded in HD at http://www.TunesToTube.com	0

COL title VAL O Pato COL performer VAL Sergio Mendes & Brasil '66	COL video title VAL Dr. John: Dippermouth Blues (featuring James “12” Andrews) COL channel name VAL Concord Records COL description VAL Amazon: http://smarturl.it/SpiritSatchCD  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee and six-time GRAMMY®-winner Dr. John is New Orleans' most prominent living musical icon. The embodiment of his hometown's freewheeling creative spirit and multiple musical traditions\, he's built a visionary\, idiosyncratic body of work that's deeply rooted in the Crescent City's myriad blues\, R&B\, jazz and rock 'n' roll traditions. So it's fitting that Dr. John's August 19\, 2014 release on Concord Records\, Ske-Dat-De-Dat...The Spirit Of Satch\, pays heartfelt tribute to another larger-than-life New Orleans legend: the seminal trumpeter and vocalist Louis "Satchmo" Armstrong\, whose musical innovations created the template for 20th-century jazz\, and whose playful attitude and life-embracing spirit made him a beloved figure whose worldwide appeal transcended music. "He's the most famous guy that ever came out of my neighborhood\," notes Dr. John. "He became a legend all over\, for his trumpet playin' and everything else\, and he was the United States' ambassador to the world."  Ske-Dat-De-Dat...The Spirit Of Satch honors Armstrong's musical genius as well as his effervescent personality with 13 quintessential numbers drawn from various phases of Armstrong's five-decade career\, with Dr. John joined by a stellar supporting cast that manages to update the material while maintaining the music's timeless emotional appeal. In addition to Dr. John's trademark vocals and piano\, and backup from some of New Orleans' finest musicians\, Ske-Dat-De-Dat…The Spirit Of Satch features a stellar assortment of guest singers and players. Bonnie Raitt shares the spotlight on a swinging reading of "I've Got the World on a String\," Ledisi and the McCrary Sisters lend gospel authority to "Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen\," Anthony Hamilton is featured on a mournful "Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child\," Shemekia Copeland trades verses with Dr. John on a playful reworking on "Sweet Hunk O' Trash\," and the Blind Boys of Alabama lend their powerful voices to "What a Wonderful World" and "Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams."   -uploaded in HD at http://www.TunesToTube.com	0

COL title VAL Lonesome Train (On a Lonesome Track) COL performer VAL Paul Burlison	COL video title VAL Lorez Alexandria -- I'm Glad There Is You (1957) COL channel name VAL JazzyRNA COL description VAL Continuing with saga of America's most gifted\, and underrated jazz vocalists—this particular artist takes the cake—not meaning the particular term in a negative connotation\, but it's such a pity that a remarkable songstress—the incomparable\, Lorez Alexandria is not afforded the recognition that she so deserves. This is proven true\, given the fact that I recently discovered her albums—and I just haven't had my fill. I've searched and purchased everything I could find from such a gifted songstress. Lorez crafts each lyric with such grace and tonality that could easily match (if not surpass) the reigning jazz stylists of the bop/jazz/pop age. She gives each standard a new sense of evocative meaning as far as lyrics are concerned\, and reinvents the wheel each time she unleashes her enthralling voice. As she once said "A lyric is dead\, until you breathe life into it." This is exactly what she does. Enjoy and listen in HD\, to the lovely—Lorez Alexandria. All right(s) to 1957 King Records\, Inc	0

COL title VAL Go Tell It on the Mountain COL performer VAL The Canadian Brass	COL video title VAL The Three Suns -- Moonlight And Roses (VintageMusic.es) COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL El grupo se formó en 1939 por Al Nevins ( guitarra ) y Nevins Morty ( acordeón ) y Artie Dunn ( voces \, órgano electrónico ). Más tarde firmó con RCA Victor . En 1944\, su primer disco de éxito fue "Twilight Time "\, escrita por la banda junto con Buck Ram . "Twilight Time" vendió más de cuatro millones de copias y fue galardonado con un disco de oro. El siguiente éxito  "Peg o' My Heart"\, que fueuno de los discos más vendidos de 1947 en los Estados Unidos. El grupo apareció en Alfred Hitchcock's Rope  (1948) y en la película  Two Gals and a Guy (1951).  El grupo sufrió varios cambios de formación en la década de 1950\, y se separó brevemente a mitad de la década antes de que Dunn resucitase  el nombre con una nueva formación. La popularidad del grupo se desvaneció y su significación histórica quedó en el olvido\, esencialmente como consecuencia del rock and roll \, pero el interés en el conjunto fue renovado en la década de los 90 por los fans de la música lounge y exotica .

If we could talk to the animals\, learn their languages\, Maybe Take an animal degree\, I'd study elephant and eagle\, buffalo and beagle\, Alligator\, guinea pig\, and flea!  I would converse in polar bear and python\, And I would curse in fluent kangaroo\, If people ask me "can you speak rhinoceros?" I'd say "of courserous! Can't you?"  If I conferred with our furry friends\, man to animal\, Think of the amazing repartee If I could walk with the animals\, talk with the animals\, Grunt and squeak and squawk with the animals\, And they could squeak and skwawk and speak and talk to us!  If I consult with the quadrupeds Think what fun wed have\, asking for the crocodiles for tea! Or maybe lunch with three lions\, walruses and sea lions What a lovely place the world would be!  If I spoke slang to orangutans The advantages any fool on earth could plainly see! Discussing Eastern art and dramas With intellectual llamas Thats a big step forward youll agree!  Id learn to speak in antelope and turtle And my Pekinese would be extremely good If I were asked to sing in hippopotamus Id say whynotamous? and I would!  If I could parlay with pachyderms Its a fairy tale worthy of Hans Anderson and Grimm A man who walks with the animals and talks with the animals Grunts and squeaks and squawks with the animals and they could talk to *me*!   Id study every *living* creatures language So I could speak to all of them on site If friends said can he talk in crab or pelican? Youd say *like hell he can and you'll be right!  And if you just stop to think of it there's no doubt of it I would win a place in history If I could walk with the animals Talk with the animals Grunt no word here squeak and squawk with the animals And they could squeak and squawk and speak and talk to me!	0

COL title VAL Little Girl Blue COL performer VAL Jeri Southern	COL video title VAL Sam Cooke - Little Girl Blue (original vinyl rip) 1961 COL channel name VAL smazexd COL description VAL When we decided to do a "blues" album with Sam Cooke\, we got together dozens of publishers' folders containing the old blues tunes that have become semi-classics of the business. As we pored over these one evening with Sam\, we could see something troubling him. To our question\, Sam answered\, "these songs are all right\, I guess\, but they're not my kinda blues."  To understand this statement\, you have to understand a little bit about Sam Cooke. He is a young man. He has been brought up in a new generation of music\, and within this new music\, he has created his own style and sound. Sam Cooke is gifted with that rare ability to be an individual performer and interpreter of music. Still\, his repertoire is drawn from the music of the past decade or so\, music that he has grown up with and that he knows best.  Sam Cooke has found the blues in the most unexpected of all places . . . right in our own backyard\, so to speak. He has taken the current standards that we have danced or hummed to so many times\, without thinking of the lyrical meaning\, and has given them a fresh meaning. What could be sadder\, really\, than a young man pleading\, "Don't Get Around Much Anymore..." or\, "Nobody Knows When You're Down And Out." Many a time\, a crowded dance floor has been happily jumping with the sounds of Out In The Cold Again\, or But Not For Me\, with not one couple thinking about the message contained in these songs\, Sam Cooke makes you think about it as he digs deep into the lyric and gives you the message in no uncertain terms. Chances are\, you will think of these tunes as "blues" from now on. And they are\, as Sam says... "That's my kinda blues."	1

COL title VAL How Insensitive COL performer VAL Peggy Lee	COL video title VAL John Coltrane & Johnny Hartman - You are too beautiful COL channel name VAL funkmoses COL description VAL John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman is a 1963 studio album featuring John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman.  Though it is often reported that Coltrane and Hartman had known each other since their days playing with Dizzy Gillespie's band in the late 1940s\, the truth is that their time in the band never overlapped. Coltrane might have heard Hartman sing at a 1950 Apollo Theater performance at which they shared the stage Hartman is the only vocalist with whom the saxophonist would record as a leader. Initially when producer Bob Thiele approached Hartman with Coltrane's request that the two record together Hartman was hesitant as he did not consider himself a jazz singer and did not think he and Coltrane would complement one another musically. However\, Thiele encouraged Hartman to go see Coltrane perform at Birdland in New York to see if something could be worked out. Hartman did so\, and after the club closed he\, Coltrane\, and Coltrane's pianist McCoy Tyner\, went over some songs together. On March 7\, 1963 Coltrane and Hartman had decided on 10 songs for the record album\, but en route to the studio they heard Nat King Cole on the radio performing "Lush Life"\, and Hartman immediately decided that song had to be included in their album. The legendary compilation was made that same day at the Van Gelder Studio in Englewood Cliffs\, New Jersey. Hartman once said that each song was done in only one take\, except for "You Are Too Beautiful"\, which required two takes because Elvin Jones dropped one of his drumsticks during the first take. In 2005\, the raw tapes were reviewed by jazz archivist Barry Kernfeld who documented there were actually complete alternate takes for all six songs that he considered "absolutely riveting." Until clear ownership of these tapes is established between the Coltrane family and Universal Music\, there are no plans for their release. Produced by Bob Thiele\, the album became an instant jazz classic\, and the renditions of "Lush Life"\, "My One and Only Love"\, and "They Say It's Wonderful" are considered definitive.	0
COL title VAL Ich bin stark\, nur mit dir COL performer VAL Mary Roos	COL video title VAL O Holy Night. - Tevin Campbell (A Very Special Christmas Vol\, 2) COL channel name VAL TsDSeason2BJolly COL description VAL Tevin Campbell Biography Tevin Jermod Campbell (born November 12\, 1976) is a five-time Grammy-nominated American R&B singer-songwriter. Campbell scored a string of R&B chart hits as a teenager in the early to mid-1990s. Campbell transitioned from child singer to adult R&B crooner\, and is a recognizable figure in the New Jack Swing genre of music.  Born in Dallas\, Texas\, Campbell was introduced to the R&B by Quincy Jones in August 1989. Campbell's debut single was "Tomorrow (A Better You Better Me)" which reached number 1 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip hop Singles chart in June 1990. It was the lead single from Quincy Jones' critically acclaimed ensemble LP Back on the Block which won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1991. After working with Jones and writers and producers including Siedah Garrett\, Campbell worked with producers Narada Michael Walden\, Al B. Sure\, Babyface\, and others to record additional music.  Campbell's first solo hit was "Round and Round"\, which charted at #3 on R&B charts in November 1991 and #13 on the Billboard Hot 100 in April 1991 was produced by Prince and was featured in Prince's film Graffiti Bridge. Campbell followed the success of his first two singles by releasing his debut album\, T.E.V.I.N.\, in November 1991 which featured the R&B hit singles and Campbell's only #1 Adult Contemporary hit: "Tell Me What You Want Me To Do" followed by:\, "Alone With You"\, and "Goodbye". His second album\, I'm Ready released October 1993\, yielded the #1 R&B hit and #9 pop single "Can We Talk" in December 1993\, "I'm Ready"\, "Always in My Heart" which charted at #3 on the R&B chart. He also scored a Top 30 hit with "Don't Say Goodbye Girl" on the R&B charts. In September 1994\, Campbell also scored an R&B hit with the single "U Will Know" as part of the R&B supergroup Black Men United\, a group that also included singer Usher.  The year 1996 saw the release of his third album\, Back to the World (#11 R&B). The title track was a success (hitting the R&B Top 20)\, but additional singles failed to make an impact on the chart. His early 1999 self-titled album was found Campbell venturing into the neo-soul venue. The project was rushed\, and as a result charted below the R&B Top 30\, with only one single charting\, a Top 30 song called "Another Way".  Campbell was nominated for five Grammy Awards and two American Music Awards.	0

Later in 1927\, Tommy Lyman sang it on the radio and then Gene Austin recorded the song for Victor.  That recording and Austin's covers of the song sold more than 5 million copies.

COL title VAL Mexicali Rose COL performer VAL Clint Eastwood	COL video title VAL Michel Legrand Orchestra - My Funny Valentine COL channel name VAL ifcopod COL description VAL Michel Legrand rarely replicates treatment of songs. Richard Rodgers' My Funny Valentine has benefited from myriad interpretations. The first here from 1974 shot through with rapid string interjections featuring jazz harmonica Toots Thielemans.If you dont like this arrangement join a  club~  Your   own club because  some  sad to say   come a cropper on this type of Legrand  Why does he not play the music straight ? Thats the  point    People who have problems with this probably  are not too keen on  the orchestra  in the first place. An  "on your toes"  encapsulation of  Legrand  is his ever alert ever   changing ~   approach ..  The second  styling  from 1962 features alto saxist Phil Woods capped superbly by Bill Costa\, Warren Smith\, Gary Burton (vibes) and a battery of percussion. The mood is cool jazz the arrangement   ~ Legrand. Have you noticed a wholly sneaky thing  happening on U Tube. A  raft of stuff  disappearing from our midst.Point in question. 1963  Reprise  album    Duke Ellingtons Symphonic Ellington    appeared some time ago  leaving Ifcopod  and musical confreres   in a delirious state of expectation. Suddenly   "now you see it now you dont"   all vamoosed  before  the word google might  censoriously  escape  from   pursed parchment  lips  Judge Judy.  .Luckily I had a copy of " la Scala She too pretty"  a delightful highlight  from Symphonic Ellington instinct with typical Ellington  orchestral  nuance nevertheless it would have been handy to have a U Tube copy on standby.  The slaughter  continues apace.  Whole wodges of stuff is getting  similar treatment ". I thought i was away on a hack  mentally storing up all  downloadable prospects. Any  in particular? Now that you ask.  Lady is a Tramp  by your friend and mine George Siravo Orchestra.  but  a slew of U Tube goodies  dangled before   greedy  eyes  suddenly snatched away  what can a  person say?. Let me  asseverate~ this is below the belt.   Now   scramble for  asseveration  in the dictionary  Last time asseveration  was invoked   someone  said surely you  mean assertion. and so our  anecdote totters to a hapless  demise.	0

COL title VAL I Need You COL performer VAL Os Britos	COL video title VAL Johnnie Ray - Ain't Misbehavin' (1956) COL channel name VAL CatsPjamas1 COL description VAL An unbelivable version of this song. One of Ray's best records\, in my opinion. What is incredible is that it didn't chart nationally in Billboard in the US\, although it was a hit in Australia and the UK. At this point\, Johnnie's last previous big success on the US charts had been in 1954\, but he was to make a major US comeback with "Just Walking in the Rain" later in 1956. It should be mentioned that "Ain't Misbehavin" DID chart in Milwaukee\, Wisconsin. Charted at #17 on UK Singles chart in April 1956.  Many versions of this song have charted over the years: #2 in the US for Leo Reisman and His Orchestra in 1929\, #7 for Louis Armstrong in 1929\, #9 for Gene Austin in 1929\, #16 for Ruth Etting in 1929\, #17 for Fats Waller in 1929\, #6 for Teddy Wilson & His Orchestra in 1937\, #6 for Dinah Washington on the R&B chart in 1948\, #3 in the UK for Tommy Bruce & the Bruisers in May 1960 and #1 on the US Country chart for Hank Williams Jr. in 1986.   Written by Fats Waller\, Harry Brooks & Andy Razaf.   B-side is "Walk Along With Kings".	0

Well\, if you're a Roy Drusky fan\, probably so. If you asked me if the album works as a whole\, I'd say no. Roy's still at the top of his game in the later stages of his career\, but most of these pop tunes just don't translate well to a country setting (like The Beatles' "Yesterday"\, which DOES NOT work as a country tune so stop trying\, dammit!). This cover of the #4 1964 Gerry And The Pacemakers hit isn't too bad\, so it's worth a listen.	0

Original Billboard review of this single: "Brown's theme\, a hit of some six years ago\, sounds as fresh as ever in this fine sounding reading with the Ames' blending warmly to fill the vocal spot originally created by Doris Day". Also #3 for Hal McIntyre and His Orchestra in April 1945\, #4 for the Merry Macs in June 1945 and #47 (on the Country chart) for Dave Dudley in 1976.   Written by Les Brown\, Bud Green and Ben Homer.   The other side of this single is "Undecided" which was a big hit.	1
COL title VAL I Should Care COL performer VAL June Christy	COL video title VAL Lorez Alexandria -- I'm Through With Love (1964) COL channel name VAL JazzyRNA COL description VAL Continuing with saga of America's most gifted\, and underrated jazz vocalists—this particular artist takes the cake—not meaning the particular term in a negative connotation\, but it's such a pity that a remarkable songstress—the incomparable\, Lorez Alexandria is not afforded the recognition that she so deserves. This is proven true\, given the fact that I recently discovered her albums—and I just haven't had my fill. I've searched and purchased everything I could find from such a gifted songstress. Lorez crafts each lyric with such grace and tonality that could easily match (if not surpass) the reigning jazz stylists of the bop/jazz/pop age. She gives each standard a new sense of evocative meaning as far as lyrics are concerned\, and reinvents the wheel each time she unleashes her enthralling voice. As she once said "A lyric is dead\, until you breathe life into it." This is exactly what she does. Enjoy and listen in HD\, to the lovely—Lorez Alexandria.

The ballad evolved from "Hey Jules"\, a song widely accepted as being written to comfort John Lennon's son\, Julian\, during his parents' divorce—although this explanation is not universally accepted and even McCartney has given conflicting accounts over the years "Hey Jude" begins with a verse-bridge structure based around McCartney's vocal performance and piano accompaniment; further instrumentation is added as the song progresses to distinguish sections. After the fourth verse\, the song shifts to a fade-out coda that lasts for more than four minutes. "Hey Jude" was released in August 1968 as the first single from The Beatles' record label Apple Records. More than seven minutes in length\, "Hey Jude" was\, at the time\, the longest single ever to top the British charts.It also spent nine weeks as number one in the United States—the longest run at the top of the American charts for a Beatles' single\, and tied the record for longest stay at number one (until the record was broken by "You Light Up My Life"). The single has sold approximately eight million copies and is frequently included on professional lists of the all-time best songs. From Wikipedia\, the free encyclopedia	0
COL title VAL Love's Gonna Live Here COL performer VAL George Jones	COL video title VAL "What The World Needs Now Is Love" (1968) The Staple Singers COL channel name VAL Gospel Nostalgia COL description VAL This is track 1 from the 1968 album "What The World Needs Now Is Love". Lead by Mavis Staples Written by Hal David and Burt Bacharach The family began appearing in Chicago-area churches in 1948\, and signed their first professional contract in 1952. During their early career they recorded in an acoustic gospel-folk style with various labels: United Records\, Vee-Jay Records(their "Uncloudy Day" and "Will The Circle Be Unbroken" were best sellers)\, Checker Records\, Riverside Records\, and then Epic Records in 1965. While the family surname is "Staples"\, the group used the singular form for its name\, resulting in the group's name being "The Staple Singers".  It was on Epic that the Staple Singers began moving into mainstream pop markets\, with "Why (Am I Treated So Bad)" and "For What It's Worth" (Stephen Stills) in 1967. In 1968\, the Staple Singers signed to Stax Records and released two albums with Steve Cropper and Booker T & the MG's — Soul Folk in Action and We'll Get Over. By 1970\, Al Bell had become producer\, and with Engineer Terry Manning\, the family began recording at the famed Muscle Shoals Sound Studio\, and Memphis' Ardent Studios\, moving in a more funk and soul direction.  The first Stax hit was "Heavy Makes You Happy (Sha-Na-Boom Boom)". Their 1971 recording of "Respect Yourself"\, written by Luther Ingram and Mack Rice\, peaked at #2 on the R&B charts and was a #12 pop hit as well. The song's theme of self-empowerment had universal appeal\, released in the period immediately following the intense American civil rights movement of the 1960s. In 1972\, the group had a huge #1 hit in the United States with "I'll Take You There". It topped both pop and R&B charts. "If You're Ready (Come Go With Me)" would become another big hit\, reaching #9 pop and #1 on the R&B chart in 1973. Then\, after Stax's bankruptcy in 1975\, they signed to Curtis Mayfield's label\, Curtom Records\, and released "Let's Do It Again"\, produced by Mayfield; the song became their second #1 pop hit in the US and the album also. In 1976\, they collaborated with The Band for their film The Last Waltz\, performing on the song "The Weight" (which The Staple Singers had previously covered on their first Stax album). However\, they were not able to regain their momentum\, releasing only occasional minor hits. Their 1984 album Turning Point featured their final Top 40 hit\, a cover of Talking Heads' "Slippery People" (which also reached the Top 5 on the Dance chart). In 1994\, they again performed the song "The Weight" with Country music artist Marty Stuart for MCA Nashville's Rhythm\, Country and Blues compilation\, somewhat re-establishing an audience. The song "Respect Yourself" was used by Spike Lee in the soundtrack to his movie Crooklyn\, made in 1994.  In 1999\, the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Pops Staples died of complications from a concussion suffered in December 2000. In 2005\, the group was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Mavis Staples has continued to carry on the family tradition and continues to add her vocal talents to both the projects of other artists and her own solo ventures. Cleotha Staples died in Chicago on February 21\, 2013\, after suffering from Alzheimer's disease for over a decade.	0

COL title VAL Time After Time COL performer VAL Cyndi Lauper	COL video title VAL Sam Cooke - Little Girl Blue (original vinyl rip) 1961 COL channel name VAL smazexd COL description VAL When we decided to do a "blues" album with Sam Cooke\, we got together dozens of publishers' folders containing the old blues tunes that have become semi-classics of the business. As we pored over these one evening with Sam\, we could see something troubling him. To our question\, Sam answered\, "these songs are all right\, I guess\, but they're not my kinda blues."  To understand this statement\, you have to understand a little bit about Sam Cooke. He is a young man. He has been brought up in a new generation of music\, and within this new music\, he has created his own style and sound. Sam Cooke is gifted with that rare ability to be an individual performer and interpreter of music. Still\, his repertoire is drawn from the music of the past decade or so\, music that he has grown up with and that he knows best.  Sam Cooke has found the blues in the most unexpected of all places . . . right in our own backyard\, so to speak. He has taken the current standards that we have danced or hummed to so many times\, without thinking of the lyrical meaning\, and has given them a fresh meaning. What could be sadder\, really\, than a young man pleading\, "Don't Get Around Much Anymore..." or\, "Nobody Knows When You're Down And Out." Many a time\, a crowded dance floor has been happily jumping with the sounds of Out In The Cold Again\, or But Not For Me\, with not one couple thinking about the message contained in these songs\, Sam Cooke makes you think about it as he digs deep into the lyric and gives you the message in no uncertain terms. Chances are\, you will think of these tunes as "blues" from now on. And they are\, as Sam says... "That's my kinda blues."	0

Obecnou známost a věhlas dal Jevanům právě Karel Gott\, jediná česká šoubyznysová hvězda příhraničního a světového významu. Ten si v roce 1969\, hned na kraji Jevan směrem od kutnohorské silnice\, koupil od rodiny Ročkových vilu pražského továrníka Aloise Köppela z roku 1930. V 80. letech ji ale od Karla Gotta koupil Miroslav Provod\, později známý jako kamarád Františka Mrázka a jeden ze šéfů pražského podsvětí\, který si nedávno odpykal pětiletý trest \, asi ne moc dobré spojení. Vila však po vzájemné dohodě obou mužů zůstala psaná na Gotta\, aby nemusel řadový programátor vysvětlovat\, kde vzal v 80. letech 170 tisíc západoněmeckých marek v hotovosti. V roce 1988 Gott prodal národnímu podniku Narex za zhruba 6 milionů korun\, které pak předal Provodovi\, který se vrátil z vězení a potřeboval peníze. Ale v roce 1996\, i kvůli nevyjasněným smluvním vztahům\, vilu opět od Narexu odkoupil. Ač s přestávkami vlastnil dům přes tři desítky let\, nikdy se zde natrvalo neusídlil. Dům byl sice plně vybaven\, zařízen na život jednoho i více lidí\, ale opravdovým domovem Gottovi nikdy nebyl.  V roce 2005 ji za 11 milionů prodal Janu Moťovskému\, který v ní otevřel muzeum Karla Gott Gottland - což byla skvělá myšlenka a mnoho fanoušků toto ocenilo. Muzeum\, ač na internetu stále „žijí" jeho stránky\, je bohužel už pár let zavřené. Návštěvnost po prvotním okouzlení opadla\, Jan Moťovský zmizel kdesi na Francouzské Riviéře a Gottland tímto chátrá. V současnosti má vila nového majitele\, zatím však na opravy a oživení čeká. Na rozdíl od Karla Gotta se Jevany staly skutečným domovem skladateli Karlu Svobodovi a později i kapelníkovi Ladislavu Štaidlovi. Ti dva měli dokonce své domy na břehu Jevanského rybníka hned vedle sebe. Štaidl se později přestěhoval do Prahy\, vilu obývá jeho syn. Karel Svoboda se na zápraží svého domu v roce 2007 zastřelil.  Chceme vidět Mistra! Právě Gottova vila se stala už v 70. letech 20. století důvodem\, proč Jevany získaly pověst prominentního letoviska a proč se sem od 70. let minulého století táhly zástupy výletníků\, aby zhlédli vilu (a zahlédli za záclonou) a také Mistra. Shodou okolností\, hned přes silnici naproti Gottovi měl víkendovou chatu všemocný František Hrabal\, ředitel Pragokoncertu\, organizace\, který za socialismu provozovala management většině vrcholových umělců z oblasti populární hudby.    Zřejmě se Karel a jeho věrní fanoušci už nedočkají \, obnovení vily a muzea dohromady \, byl to skvělí nápad a však zmařen \, to si Karel Gott nezaslouží \, toto opravdu ne \, dle mě je to ostuda \, budeme však doufat.	0

The ballad evolved from "Hey Jules"\, a song widely accepted as being written to comfort John Lennon's son\, Julian\, during his parents' divorce—although this explanation is not universally accepted and even McCartney has given conflicting accounts over the years "Hey Jude" begins with a verse-bridge structure based around McCartney's vocal performance and piano accompaniment; further instrumentation is added as the song progresses to distinguish sections. After the fourth verse\, the song shifts to a fade-out coda that lasts for more than four minutes. "Hey Jude" was released in August 1968 as the first single from The Beatles' record label Apple Records. More than seven minutes in length\, "Hey Jude" was\, at the time\, the longest single ever to top the British charts.It also spent nine weeks as number one in the United States—the longest run at the top of the American charts for a Beatles' single\, and tied the record for longest stay at number one (until the record was broken by "You Light Up My Life"). The single has sold approximately eight million copies and is frequently included on professional lists of the all-time best songs. From Wikipedia\, the free encyclopedia	1

COL title VAL Material Girl COL performer VAL Steven Charles Boone	COL video title VAL Maud Powell - (Coleridge-Taylor/Powell) Deep River COL channel name VAL 2ndviolinist COL description VAL Maud Powell (August 22\, 1867  January 8\, 1920) IMHO the best American violinist.  MAUD POWELL - A Pioneer's Legacy by Karen A. Shaffer (edited to fit) Maud Powell was born on August 22\, 1867\, in Peru\, Illinois\, on the western frontier in the American heartland. Her grandparents had been Methodist missionaries in Ohio\, Wisconsin\, and Illinois before the Civil War. Her father William Bramwell Powell was an innovative educator; superintendent of the public schools in Peru\, then Aurora\, IL\, and finally Washington\, D.C. Her mother Minnie Paul Powell was a pianist and composer whose gender precluded a career. Minnie and Bramwell's sisters were active in the woman's suffrage movement. Maud's uncle John Wesley Powell\, Civil War hero and explorer of the Grand Canyon\, organized the scientific study of the western lands and the native Indians as the powerful director of the U.S. Geological Survey and Bureau of Ethnology and founder of the National Geographic Society.  A prodigy\, Powell began violin and piano study in Aurora\, Illinois\, then studied violin four years with William Lewis in Chicago\, to whom she "owed the most." She completed her training with Europe's greatest masters -- Henry Schradieck in Leipzig\, Charles Dancla in Paris\, and Joseph Joachim in Berlin. Returning to the United States knowing that "girl violinists were looked upon with suspicion\," Powell boldly walked into a rehearsal of the all-male New York Philharmonic in Steinway Hall and demanded a hearing from Theodore Thomas\, then America's foremost conductor. Deeply impressed\, Thomas acknowledged his "musical grandchild" and hired her on the spot to perform the Bruch G minor violin concerto with the New York Philharmonic on November 14\, 1885. New York critic Henry E. Krehbiel acclaimed the 18-year-old's debut performance: "She is a marvellously gifted woman\, one who in every feature of her playing discloses the instincts and gifts of a born artist."  The young violinist pioneered the violin recital as she blazed new concert circuits throughout the country\, even braving the primitive touring conditions in the Far West to reach people who had never heard a concert before. She explained: "I do not play to them as an artist to the public\, but as one human being to another." Theodore Thomas chose Maud Powell to represent America's achievement in violin performance at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. During the 1893 Exposition\, Powell presented a paper to the Women's Musical Congress\, "Women and the Violin\," in which she encouraged young women to take up the violin seriously. At a time when women could not vote and were precluded from playing in professional orchestras\, she argued that there was no reason why a woman should not play the violin with the best of the men.  Powell herself had proved to the world that a woman could play the violin as well as a man\, fulfilling the shared hopes of her mother and woman suffrage leaders Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Her example inspired young girls to take up the violin and women to form music clubs and orchestras throughout the land.  Powell became one of America's most revered and beloved musicians while her 1907 recording of Drdla's Souvenir became the most popular violin record of its day.  Maud Powell toured Europe\, North America and South Africa to wide acclaim\, appearing with the great orchestras of her time under such conductors as Mahler\, Nikisch\, Thomas\, Safonov\, Damrosch\, Seidl\, Richter\, Wood\, Herbert and Stokowski.  Perhaps Powell's greatest artistic triumph was her American premiere (November 30\, 1906) of the Sibelius Violin Concerto\, which she glowingly described as "a gigantic rugged thing\, an epic really....It is on new lines and has a new technique. O\, it is wonderful." Powell introduced fourteen violin concertos to the American public -- by Tchaikovsky\, Dvořák\, Saint-Saëns\, Lalo\, Sibelius\, Coleridge-Taylor\, Arensky\, Aulin\, Huss\, Shelley\, Conus\, Bruch and Rimsky-Korsakov. She also revived neglected works of the 18th century\, including Mozart's Sinfonia Concertante for violin and viola\, and even edited a Locatelli violin sonata for publication. She boldly championed works by American composers. Maud Powell died the year the 19th Amendment granting national suffrage to women was ratified. Upon her death on January 8\, 1920\, the New York Symphony paid tribute to this "supreme and unforgettable artist": "She was not only America's great master of the violin\, but a woman of lofty purpose and noble achievement\, whose life and art brought to countless thousands inspiration for the good and the beautiful." © Karen A.

( Famous Blue Raincoat ) COL channel name VAL Sirens Meadow COL description VAL Album  " Hadde månen en søster: Cohen på norsk " \, ( 1993 )  Det er fire om morgenen\, det er sent i desember. Jeg skriver for å spørre deg hvordan du har det. Det er vinter i Oslo\, men for meg er det stedet. Det er musikk fra kaféen i Pilestredet. Jeg har hørt at du flyttet til en øy ute ved kysten. Kan du leve for ingenting nå? Syns du skal føre et slags regnskap.  Og han var her med en lokk av ditt hår. Han sa han fikk den den natten i vår\, da du trodde du skulle gå fri. Har du noen gang gått fri?  Du så mye eldre ut sist gang vi så deg. Du kledde ikke klærne du hadde tatt på deg. Du sto på perrongen -- der hver møtte sin\, men du gikk alltid hjemover uten James Dean. Så tok du min elsker\, du tok ham for gitt. Og da han kom hjem\, var hans liv ikke mitt.  Å\, jeg ser deg der\, med en rose i munnen. Ei sigøynerske gjorde et funn. Vel\, jeg ser han er våken her nå. Han ber meg å hilse.  Hva kan jeg få sagt deg\, min søster\, min morderske? Hva kan jeg si deg med ord? Jeg tror nok jeg savner deg\, tror nok jeg tilgir deg\, glad at du gjorde det du gjorde. Om du kommer tilbake\, om du kommer forbi: Din fiende sover nå\, og mannen hennes er fri.  Og takk for det mørket du tok fra hans blikk. Det har jeg aldri forsøkt. Jeg trodde ikke det gikk.  Og han var her med en lokk av ditt hår. Han sa han fikk den den natten i vår\, da du trodde du skulle gå fri.  Med hilsen din venn  Original : Leonard Cohen  It's four in the morning\, the end of December I'm writing you now just to see if you're better New York is cold\, but I like where I'm living There's music on Clinton Street  all through the evening.  I hear that you're building  your little house deep in the desert You're living for nothing now\,  I hope you're keeping some kind of record.  Yes\, and Jane came by with a lock of your hair She said that you gave it to her That night that you planned to go clear Did you ever go clear?  Ah\, the last time we saw you  you looked so much older Your famous blue raincoat  was torn at the shoulder You'd been to the station  to meet every train And you came home without Lili Marlene  And you treated my woman  to a flake of your life And when she came back  she was nobody's wife.  Well I see you there with  the rose in your teeth One more thin gypsy thief Well I see Jane's awake -- She sends her regards.  And what can I tell you  my brother\, my killer What can I possibly say? I guess that I miss you\,  I guess I forgive you I'm glad you stood in my way.  If you ever come by here\, for Jane or for me Your enemy is sleeping\, and his woman is free.  Yes\, and thanks\, for the trouble  you took from her eyes I thought it was there for good  so I never tried.  And Jane came by with a lock of your hair She said that you gave it to her That night that you planned to go clear  -- Sincerely\, L. Cohen	0

COL title VAL Breaking the Law COL performer VAL Judas Priest	COL video title VAL The Kirby Stone Four (1958) - Baubles\, Bangles And Beads COL channel name VAL NBCRecords COL description VAL Born in New York City on April 27\, 1918\, Kirby (whose real name was Herbert)\, formed Herby Stone And His Pebbles shortly after the end of WWII\, which by 1947 had evolved into The Kirby Stone Quintette (later shortened to Quintet). The line-up consisted of Kirby (trumpet)\, Art Cow Eyes Engler (saxophone)\, Michael Gardner (piano)\, Bernie Doc Mandel (bass) and Gene Thaler (later replaced by Eddie Hall) (drums). Within a few short years\, the group had become a four piece featuring Kirby\, Michael\, Eddie and first rate impressionist Larry Foster. The Quintet had become a Quartet and then simply a Four\, and it was with this line-up that Kirby found his greatest success\, including a Grammy nomination in 1958 for the song Baubles\, Bangles And Beads (taken from Kismet).   Although the group re-recorded the song in 1964\, and again in 1968\, it is the 1958 version\, issued on the Columbia label\, that shows the group at its peak (and is regarded by many as the ultimate version of this Wright & Forrest classic).   As well as recording\, The Kirby Stone Four appeared on television and in nightclubs across the USA (including their own Kirby Stone Fourum club in New York City)\, and toured overseas.  In the latter half of the 1960s\, Larry left the group to once more pursue a solo career as an impressionist\, and he was replaced by Jimmy Hassell. However\, this line-up was fairly short-lived\, and by the end of the decade the Kirby Stone Four had disbanded. Kirby\, however\, continued touring and recording into the 1970s\, with Kirby Stone & The Ethnic Family and The Kirby Stone Company. He passed away on July 13\, 1981\, aged 63.  This clip features a chronological history of Kirby\, the groups he led\, and the recordings he made. Enjoy!	0

COL title VAL Trains and Boats and Planes COL performer VAL Jacqui Brookes	COL video title VAL The Mountain Ramblers - Jesse James COL channel name VAL mrwonderful COL description VAL Based out of the musically hyperactive mountain area of Galax\, VA\, this band's early recordings are considered as important to the early beginnings of bluegrass as the first records by mandolinist Bill Monroe and his Bluegrass Boys. Bandleader James Lindsey preferred describing his group as playing mountain music\, making the name Mountain Ramblers descriptive not only of the band's geographical home base but of their musical style\, which evolved with various changes in direction and membership over more than 20 years. By maintaining its existence over such an extended period of time\, the group became to classic bluegrass what combos such as the Drifters or the Coasters are to rhythm & blues and doo-wop\, although the mountain music genre seems to have inspired a trifle less franchising and band-cloning.  The band was recorded in 1958 by Alan Lomax\, out on one of his many music gathering and recording explorations. He was fortunately able to record tracks featuring the group with its prime lineup of players.	0

COL title VAL Adoro COL performer VAL Vikki Carr	COL video title VAL Mireille Mathieu - Que nadie sepa mi sufrir (La Foule) COL channel name VAL Cantando Tangos COL description VAL Una de las principales voces femeninas de Francia interpretando el valsesito de Dizeo y Cabral.  La Foule  El éxito internacional de"Que nadie sepa mi sufrir"originalmente compuesta por el argentino Ángel Cabral en 1936\, con letra de Enrique Dizeo en ritmo de vals criollo como se le conoce en Argentina\, comenzó en 1953\, en oportunidad de la presentación en el Teatro Ópera de Buenos Aires\, de  la cantante francesa Édith Piaf\, quien escucha una grabación de Alberto Castillo. Esta inolvidable intérprete escuchó el valsecito y se lo llevó a su país. Ya en París\, convocó al autor Michel Rivgauche\, quien le cambió la letra por completo y el título\, así nació La Foule\, que en francés significa La Multitud. La transformación resultó un éxito extraordinario desde que fue publicada en 1957.  La letra original está claramente destinada a ser cantada por un hombre que ha sido abandonado por su amante\, mientras que la canción de Edith Piaf mantiene la angustia en el contexto de una chica aturdida que conoce un hombre en medio de una multitud para perderlo casi de inmediato.  www.carlostangodj.com	0

COL title VAL It's Only a Paper Moon COL performer VAL John Pizzarelli	COL video title VAL Django Reinhardt - St.Louis Blues - 1935 September 30 - Decca\, Paris COL channel name VAL Heinz Becker COL description VAL Stéphane Grappelli and his Hot Four   Stéphane Grappelli (v); Django Reinhardt (g solo); Joseph Reinhardt\, Pierre "Baro" Ferret (g); Louis Vola (b)  1935 September 30 - Decca\, Paris   Grappelli might have been the leader on this date\, but Django is the soloist for all but the last minute of this record. For anyone of that time who was not aware of the guitarist\, the unaccompanied introduction might make them think that they were hearing a classical player. Yet\, as Django slides into a slow-walk tempo and the opening melody of "St. Louis Blues"\, there is no doubt that his heart lies in jazz. He makes effective use of bent notes in the opening chorus\, and his flashy but tasteful runs add dramatic contrast. When he goes to the tango section\, he adds to the drama with strong lines in parallel octaves. The tempo picks up as the band returns to the blues choruses\, and Reinhardt's final chorus is marked by block chords and one of his trademarked guitar rolls.

Written by Jimmy Kennedy and Michael Carr.  SOUTH OF THE BORDER  South of the border\, down Mexico way\, That's where I fell in love When the stars above came out to play. And now as I wander\, my thoughts ever stray South of the border\, down Mexico way.  She was a picture in old Spanish lace. And for a tender while I kissed the smile upon her face. For it was fiesta\, and we were so gay South of the border\, Mexico way.  Then she sighed as she whispered 'manana' Never dreaming that we were parting. And I lied as I whispered 'manana' For our tomorrow never came.  South of the border\, I rode back one day There in a veil of white by candlelight She knelt to pray. The mission bells told me that I mustn't stay South of the border\, down Mexico way.  Ai-ai-ai-ai (ai-ai-ai-ai) Ai-ai-ai-ai (ai-ai-ai-ai) Ai-ai-ai-ai ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  From Wiki:  "South of the Border" is a popular song describing a trip to Mexico\, written by Jimmy Kennedy and Michael Carr and published in 1939 for the film of the same name starring country star Gene Autry.[1]  In the lyrics\, a man looks back with regret and pain for having lied to the woman he can't forget ("...and now as I wander\, my thoughts ever stray...") and returned for too late\, just as she was preparing for marriage. The lyric is in juxtaposition with the music\, which swings with syncopated joy.  The song was a hit in 1939 for Shep Fields\, vocal by Hal Derwin. It has been recorded by many artists\, but the best-known versions are by Autry and Frank Sinatra (1953). The song was recorded in August 1961 by Patsy Cline for her album Patsy Cline Showcase and appears on Herb Alpert's 1964 album South of the Border.	0

COL title VAL When a Man Loves a Woman COL performer VAL Mae West	COL video title VAL Texas Jim Robertson Home on the Range COL channel name VAL vinyhilist COL description VAL Another side from Victor Set P-84 -- Round the Campfire: Famous American Cowboy Songs by Texas Jim Robertson with orchestra.   James Battle "Texas Jim" Robertson was born February 2\, 1909 near Batesville\, Texas. He recorded more than one hundred sides for RCA Victor and Bluebird during the 1940s but never released a 12" LP. When Robertson was not joined by his band\, the Panhandle Punchers\, sidemen on his recordings included Roy Wiggins\, Andy Sanella\, and Vaughn Horton on steel guitar\, some with Chet Atkins on electric guitar\, and probably Jethro Burns on mandolin. Robertson was reported dead by suicide in 1966 at age 57. One year later\, a man named Clifford Kent begins performing in Fort Worth and claims to be Texas Jim Robertson. He tells of a fire in his New York city apartment and his wish to change his identity. Clifford Kent continues to perform in Fort Worth until the early 1970s. http://www.governor.state.tx.us/music/tour/pioneers2	0

COL title VAL That's All COL performer VAL Eliane Elias	COL video title VAL THE BIRDIES- "THE HUCKLEBUCK '65" (1965) COL channel name VAL funknroll COL description VAL "Start a little movement in your WOH-WOH-WOH!"  "The Hucklebuck" was a Big Band and Jump Jive standard from the 40's. Everybody had a variation of it in their repertoire. The reason was that 'hucklebuck' was a euphemism for something the latter part of it rhymed with. When couples trysted to it on the dancefloor\, band leaders knew how to swing that sexual energy. It survived into Rock'n'Roll through versions like Chubby Checker's\, which may be where the Birdies learned to shake a tailfeather.   The "Girls In the Garage" CD I culled it from was no help for any info about them. (Where are Alec Palao or Lois Wilson when you need them? Hopefully making the all-girls NUGGETS box set of my dreams!) But a fan informed me they were another guise of Darlene Love & the Blossoms! Ms. Love is legendary for her chameleonic turns behind the mike under different names: The Crystals ("He's a Rebel"); Bobb B. Soxx & the Blue Jeans; and the K-C-Ettes\, behind guitarist Al Casey ("Surfin' Hootenanny"). Darlene had a funny story of evading producer Phil Spector when he was mad at her for working other studios under aliases\, but now that story sounds really ominous. Darlene is also famous for portraying Danny Glover's wife in the 'Lethal Weapon' movies\, and is just as potent a performer today.    To have a Movement\, ya gotta move first. Rock propelled the hips before it prodded people to be hip in awareness. As Feminism would soon declare\, "the personal is political".  Just the act of freeing your body\, your inhibitions\, your appearance\, your choice of partner\, or your choice of music was tantamount to a political action. In a turbulent time when the youth were starting to question everything about any arbitrary boundaries\, every move they made away from these was rebellion. No neat little boxes for them. More like a spectrum of rooms to explore and exceed. In this moment\, the air is electric with the tension of possibility...

COL title VAL It Is No Secret COL performer VAL Mahalia Jackson	COL video title VAL Roy Rogers & Dale Evans -- It Is Not Secret COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Roy Rogers y Dale Evans  Roy Rogers (5 de noviembre de 1911 -- 6 de julio de 1998)\, fue un cantante y actor cowboy estadounidense. Tras cuatro años de poco éxito\, en 1934 formó Sons of the Pioneers\, un grupo de música cowboy. El grupo tuvo éxitos como las canciones "Cool Water" y "Tumbling Tumbleweeds".  Dale Evans es el nombre artístico de Lucille Wood Smith (31 de octubre de 1912 - 7 de febrero de 2001)\, una escritora\, estrella de cine y cantautora estadounidense.  Rogers se convirtió en una atracción para la taquilla\, y su esposa Dale Evans trabajó con él en una película en 1945. Roy y Dale se casaron en 1947 en Davis\, Oklahoma\, donde unos meses antes habían filmado "Home In Oklahoma". Roy y Dale permanecieron casados hasta la muerte del artista en 1998. Rogers fue un ídolo del público infantil gracias a sus programas televisivos y a sus películas. La mayor parte de sus filmes tras la Segunda Guerra Mundial se rodó en Trucolor\, cuando casi todo el cine de serie B de la época se filmaba en blanco y negro. En algunas de sus películas había una trama animal\, con el caballo de Rogers\, un palomino dorado llamado Trigger\, centrando la acción. Rogers también aparecía acompañado de un pastor alemán llamado Bullet. Hizo más de cien títulos de su serie. El show se emitió por la radio durante nueve años\, y después por la televisión entre 1951 y 1957. En estas producciones usualmente existía un compañero\, a menudo Pat Brady\, o Gabby Hayes. El mote de Rogers era "Rey de los Cowboys". El de Dale era "Reina del Oeste". Roy y Dale fueron incluidos en el Western Performers Hall of Fame del National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum en Oklahoma City\, Oklahoma en 1976. Rogers entró de nuevo en 1995 como miembro de Sons of the Pioneers. También fue elegido en dos ocasiones para entrar en el Museo y Salón de la Fama del Country\, primero en 1980 como miembro del grupo Sons of the Pioneers\, y después en 1988 como solista.

COL title VAL At Last COL performer VAL Etta James	COL video title VAL DAVID RUFFIN -"RAINY NIGHT IN GEORGIA" (1971) COL channel name VAL MANNY MORA COL description VAL It's well known that Motown recorded more material than it could release\, but its reasons for shelving material remain a mystery to this day. Ever since the CD reissue boom of the late '80s\, this unreleased material has begun to trickle out of the vaults\, and when it does surface in such forms as the dynamite double-disc set A Cellarful of Motown!\, the music is so good it's hard to believe that it never was released at the time. Knowing this\, it should not come as a complete surprise that former Temptations lead singer David Ruffin had a full\, completed album shelved in 1971\, but hearing Hip-O Select's excavation of that album on the 2004 release David: The Unreleased Album\, it's still a wonder that this record sat in the vaults for over three decades\, with very few of the songs recorded during the sessions appearing on other records and compilations over the years. Far from being unreleasable\, David (titled as such because the album was never given a proper title -- it was given a catalog number and track sequencing\, with David Ruffin penciled in as its name\, but that was used as the title for his 1973 album) finds Ruffin at a solo peak\, not just a singer but in terms of material. He cut the 12 songs that comprised the album\, along with the seven bonus tracks from the same sessions that fill out this CD reissue\, in late 1969 and 1970\, after he had a big solo hit with "My Whole World Ended (The Moment You Left Me)\," with the intent of releasing the album in 1971. There were a pair of covers of recent hits -- an appropriately heartbroken and seductive "Rainy Night in Georgia" and a rather revelatory "I Want You Back\," which added real grit to the Jackson 5's effervescent smash -- but most of this was material written for Ruffin and it played to his strengths. While this music was rooted in Motown's signature sound and performed by the Funk Brothers\, it also looked beyond Detroit\, adding heavy doses of funk\, psychedelia\, and smooth soul\, filled with galvanizing horns\, driving guitars\, down-n-dirty clavinets\, flourishes of electric sitar\, fuzz tones\, and wah-wah guitars\, all grounded by Ruffin's earthy testifying and tied together by top-notch songwriting. All these elements wound up sounding much hipper than much of the music officially released by Motown in the early 1970\, when Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye were just beginning to break free of the studio's formula\, and while David and its accompanying bonus tracks are not a masterpiece along the lines of Talking Book or What's Going On (or even Where I'm Coming From\, for that matter)\, it's vibrant\, exciting music that still sounds fresh -- arguably fresher than full-length Temptations albums of the late '60s -- which qualifies it as a lost classic of sorts. Why was it lost\, consigned to the vaults for nearly three and a half decades? According to the liner notes\, nobody really knows. Ruffin wasn't popular among the executives at Motown in the early '70s\, and he was also going through a number of well-documented personal problems\, so it's possible that Motown simply didn't want to promote him at the time\, but it's also true that the label had a number of great records\, including Marvin's What's Going On\, to release in 1971\, and Ruffin had two LPs out in 1970\, including a duet album with his brother Jimmy\, so the market may have been saturated. We'll likely never know the reason why David was buried\, but fortunately it has been unearthed\, and it's a reason for hardcore soul and Motown fans to celebrate.	0

COL title VAL Just One of Those Things COL performer VAL Peggy Lee and Gordon Jenkins and His Orchestra	COL video title VAL Rosemary Clooney & Perez Prado - You Do Something To Me (VintageMusic.es) COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Rosemary Clooney\, disfrutó durante la década de los cincuenta de una extraordinaria fama con canciones absolutamente mediocres. De la mano de Mitch Miller\, director artístico de la casa Columbia\, aplicó el inexorable principio de que\, cuantos peores eran los arreglos y las letras de los temas\, mas beneficio económico para la discográfica. onsiguió grabar un par de duets con Frank Sinatra en 1950 y a partir de ahí le sobrevino la fama y la popularidad. Tuvo su propio show televisivo e incluso Hollywood llamó a su puerta para que participara junto a Bing Crosby y Danny Kaye en algunas comedias musicales siendo la mas celebre el film de Michael Curtiz\, "White Christmas".No obstante lo dicho\, Rosemary Clooney\, se acercó tardíamente al jazz y grabó una par de magníficos álbumes para Columbia: "The Best Of Hollywood" con la orquesta del trompetista\, Harry James\, y "Blue Rose"\, su obra mas conseguida y un disco que pudo ser memorable con la orquesta de Duke Ellington. Es la tía sanguínea del actual actor George Clooney.  Dámaso Pérez Prado (Matanzas\, Cuba\, 11 de diciembre de 1916 - Ciudad de México\, 14 de septiembre de 1989)\, el "Rey del Mambo"\, fue un músico\, compositor y arreglista cubano.Dámaso Pérez Prado es mayormente conocido por sus aportes al género del mambo\, que tiene sus orígenes en el danzón cubano y daría pauta al surgimiento y desarrollo del chachachá.Pasado el clímax del mambo\, es llamativo que Dámaso Pérez Prado\, una vez compuesta su pieza musical "Patricia" y obtenido su éxito correspondiente\, la grabase muchas veces y con diferentes arreglos\, actitud que parece demostrar que tuvo por dicha pieza una especial predilección. Entre sus composiciones más conocidas se encuentran Qué rico el mambo y Mambo Nº 5\, ésta última después lanzada en una nueva versión en 1999 por el cantante alemán Lou Bega.

COL title VAL Powerhouse COL performer VAL Don Byron	COL video title VAL Django Reinhardt - St.Louis Blues - 1935 September 30 - Decca\, Paris COL channel name VAL Heinz Becker COL description VAL Stéphane Grappelli and his Hot Four   Stéphane Grappelli (v); Django Reinhardt (g solo); Joseph Reinhardt\, Pierre "Baro" Ferret (g); Louis Vola (b)  1935 September 30 - Decca\, Paris   Grappelli might have been the leader on this date\, but Django is the soloist for all but the last minute of this record. For anyone of that time who was not aware of the guitarist\, the unaccompanied introduction might make them think that they were hearing a classical player. Yet\, as Django slides into a slow-walk tempo and the opening melody of "St. Louis Blues"\, there is no doubt that his heart lies in jazz. He makes effective use of bent notes in the opening chorus\, and his flashy but tasteful runs add dramatic contrast. When he goes to the tango section\, he adds to the drama with strong lines in parallel octaves. The tempo picks up as the band returns to the blues choruses\, and Reinhardt's final chorus is marked by block chords and one of his trademarked guitar rolls. When Grappelli enters\, Reinhardt steals the spotlight back with his unique accompanying style featuring choppy block chords and rolls at the turnarounds.	0

In 1966 Steve Lonsdale took over the lead vocals\, and Richard Crouse married Wanda Arletti who joined the group for a tour of Zambia. In 1967 Eddie Boyle – bass\, and Ronnie Cline – organ\, joined the group. In 1968 Billy Forrest approached the group to record “Cry to me” for the film “Katrina”. This song became their biggest hit\, reaching number 1 on the South African Top 20 in 1969 and charting for a massive 38 weeks\, earning them a double gold disc.  In 1969 John Elliot – sax\, joined the group and in 1970 Ivor Black – drums and Peter Vee – lead vocals (Steve Lonsdale left for America).

His stage name (always spelled with a capital "M" and a capital "K") is a homage to 1960s British pop producer Joe Meek. A multi-instrumentalist\, MeeK plays all the instruments on his recordings through a multitracked/multi-layered method of recording and provides all vocals including multi-layered backing harmonies… Full article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MeeK  (NOTE : on October 25th 2012\, YouTube permanently deleted MeeK's initial official YouTube channel - "MeeKInTheWeb" - because of our uploading of MeeK's music video "You'll Never Die Alone"\, which in their view constituted a "violation of YouTube terms" as it showed humorous sex scenes in animation form - i.e. cartoon - a commission for an AIDS awareness campaign. On the day the original MeeK YouTube channel was deleted\, it totaled more than 1\,000\,000 views\, had 10\,000+ subcribers and MeeK's then most popular songs "Six Feet Under" and "So Fresh" had more than 450\,000 and 80\,000 views respectively.)	0

Lester E. (Les) Elgart comenzó a tocar la trompeta cuando era un adolescente\, y con 20 años de edad había ya realizado conciertos profesionales. En la década de 1940 tocó en las bandas dirigidas por Raymond Scott\, Charlie Spivak\, y Harry James\, y de vez en cuando en  bandas junto con el hermano Larry. Juntos crean la suya propia "Les & Larry Elgart Ensemble" en 1945\, y contratan a Nelson Riddle\, Ralph Flanagan\, y Bill Finegan para  hacer arreglos.  La unión fue efímera\, sin embargo\, debido a la huelga de Músicos de la Unión  y la disminución de la popularidad del jazz de Swing\, se separaron en 1946. En 1952\, el dúo se reunió y publicó un número importante de álbumes en Columbia Records\, muchos de considerable éxito de ventas.  Entre sus canciones más conocidas es "Bandstand Boogie"\, que fue utilizado por Dick Clark como la canción de "American Bandstand. Más tarde\, en la década de 1950 Les alejado de los negocios y la manipulación del grupo puso fin a la banda.  Les siguió trabajando hasta su muerte por insuficiencia cardíaca en Dallas\, Texas en 1995.

COL title VAL Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer COL performer VAL Freddy Cannon	COL video title VAL Ella Fitzgerald - No Other Love COL channel name VAL Alissa Lovera COL description VAL Talk about a rara avis -- for four decades\, Ella Sings Broadway has been the most obscure and hard to find of Ella Fitzgerald's classic Verve albums. Those who did invest the time and money in unearthing it were amply rewarded: The set is a perfect complement to Fitzgerald's classic series of Song Book albums. Unlike the Song Books\, however\, Ella Sings Broadway concentrates not on the time-honored history of The Great White Way and its stellar songwriters\, but on songs and shows by writers that were part of Broadway's recent past: Rodgers and Hammerstein (South Pacific\, Me and Juliet) Adler and Ross (Damn Yankees\, The Pajama Game)\, Frank Loesser (Guys and Dolls)\, and Lerner and Loewe (Brigadoon\, My Fair Lady).  This overlooked gem of an album was arranged and conducted by Marty Paich\, the man responsible for such other Fitzgerald triumphs as Ella Swings Brightly and Whisper Not -- which places Ella Sings Broadway in most excellent company.  www.vervemusicgroup.com	0

COL title VAL Blowin' in the Wind/Don't Think Twice It's All Right COL performer VAL The Ventures	COL video title VAL Julie London - Gone With The Wind (Liberty Records 1955) COL channel name VAL RoundMidnightTV COL description VAL "Gone with the Wind" is a popular song. The music was written by Allie Wrubel\, the lyrics by Herb Magidson. The song was published in 1937. A version recorded by Horace Heidt was a #1 song in 1937. Diane E. Holloway\, who has written extensively on American popular songs\, indicates that the title was inspired by the 1936 publication of the novel Gone with the Wind\, and the timing indicates that this is likely. But the lyrics have no connection to the subject matter of the novel\, and this song should not be confused with any of the music featured in the 1939 film adaptation.  Julie London (September 26\, 1926 – October 18\, 2000) was an American singer and actress\, whose career spanned more than 40 years. Born in Santa Rosa\, California to vaudevillian parents\, London was discovered while working as an elevator operator in downtown Los Angeles\, and began her career as an actress. London's 35-year acting career began in film in 1944\, and included roles as the female lead in numerous Westerns\, co-starring with Rock Hudson in The Fat Man (1951)\, with Robert Taylor and John Cassavetes in Saddle the Wind (1958)\, and opposite Robert Mitchum in The Wonderful Country (1959).  In the mid-1950s\, she signed a recording contract with the newly established Liberty Records\, and released a total of 32 albums of pop and jazz standards during the 1950s and 1960s\, with her signature song being "Cry Me a River"\, which she introduced in 1955. London was noted by critics for her husky\, smoky voice and languid vocal style. She released her final studio album in 1969\, but achieved continuing success playing the female starring role of Nurse Dixie McCall\, in the television series Emergency! (1972–79)\, in which she appeared opposite her real-life husband\, Bobby Troup. The show was produced by her ex-husband\, Jack Webb.  A shy and introverted woman\, London rarely granted interviews\, and spent the remainder of her life out of the public sphere. In 1995\, she suffered a stroke\, which left her with permanent health problems\, and died five years later of a heart attack.  Julie's accompanied by Ray Leatherwood (bass)\, and Barney Kessel (guitar).  Gone with the wind Gone like a leaf that has blown away Gone with the wind My romance has flown away  Yesterday's kisses are still on my lips  I had a lifetime of heaven at my fingertips   But now all is gone Gone is the rapture that thrilled my heart Gone with the wind Gone is the gladness that filled my heart  Just like a flame\, love burned brightly  Then became an empty smoke dream that has gone\,  Gone with the wind  Gone with the wind Gone with the wind Gone with the wind	0

COL title VAL Satin Doll COL performer VAL Trudy Pitts and Mr. C.	COL video title VAL United We Stand - Brotherhood of Man COL channel name VAL Julie Oliverio COL description VAL Brotherhood of Man and The New Seekers are among a handful of 70s pop-folk artists who were very effective in utilizing full choral harmonies in their sound to evoke the sense of togetherness and oneness characteristic of the era.  This is United We Stand by Euro-pop group Brotherhood of Man\, who ran the top of the British pop charts several times from 1970 to 1976\, but only achieved American radio play with this LP.  Frankly\, this song just melts me.  It's corny\, it's idealistic\, it's lyrics are simple but it's melodies are gorgeous\, and the original members here (Tony Hillard\, Tony Burrows\, Sunny Leslie and Sue Glover) are earnest and true in their presentation.  Like most choral pop groups\, the band would endure an endless shuffle of members\, and by 1976 none of the original four remained\, but the innocence\, optimism and sweetness of this track always will.	0

Lester E. (Les) Elgart comenzó a tocar la trompeta cuando era un adolescente\, y con 20 años de edad había ya realizado conciertos profesionales. En la década de 1940 tocó en las bandas dirigidas por Raymond Scott\, Charlie Spivak\, y Harry James\, y de vez en cuando en  bandas junto con el hermano Larry. Juntos crean la suya propia "Les & Larry Elgart Ensemble" en 1945\, y contratan a Nelson Riddle\, Ralph Flanagan\, y Bill Finegan para  hacer arreglos.  La unión fue efímera\, sin embargo\, debido a la huelga de Músicos de la Unión  y la disminución de la popularidad del jazz de Swing\, se separaron en 1946. En 1952\, el dúo se reunió y publicó un número importante de álbumes en Columbia Records\, muchos de considerable éxito de ventas.  Entre sus canciones más conocidas es "Bandstand Boogie"\, que fue utilizado por Dick Clark como la canción de "American Bandstand. Más tarde\, en la década de 1950 Les alejado de los negocios y la manipulación del grupo puso fin a la banda.  Les siguió trabajando hasta su muerte por insuficiencia cardíaca en Dallas\, Texas en 1995.

Celebrating its 25th anniversary this year\, Charlie Haden's Quartet West has been championed as one of jazz's most consistently compelling bands dedicated not only to creatively revealing the secrets of the standards but as a band that is known the world over for its own sophisticated music. The quartet originally started as a side project for Haden who lives in Southern California to play with some of the great players in Los Angeles however it received such immediate acclaim that it has continued to perform and record continuously since 1986. This latest recording\, Sophisticated Ladies\, released in Europe in October 2010 to rave reviews (including a lengthy run in France as the No. 1 jazz album)\, opens the latest chapter in Quartet West's historic story with the legendary bassist at the helm. It should be noted that Charlie Haden is an omnivorous listener and collector who has gathered what he calls "a vault" of songs that he loves and that have often slipped under the radar in appreciation. Thus instead of relying on the well-treaded Great American Song library\, the bassist and bandleader brings to light lesser-known tunes delivered with refined improvisations that are equal parts romantic\, classy\, elegant and alluring.  For the wonderfully sublime Sophisticated Ladies\, Quartet West's new CD and seventh overall\, the core group of piano\, sax\, bass and drums embarks into familiar territory however with a new cast of collaborators: six of contemporary music's top-tier singers\, including\, in order of appearance\, Melody Gardot\, Norah Jones\, Cassandra Wilson\, Ruth Cameron\, Renée Fleming and Diana Krall. With his warm-toned bass lines anchoring the proceedings\, Haden leads his band comprising tenor saxophonist Ernie Watts\, pianist and orchestral strings arranger Alan Broadbent\, and drummer Rodney Green who makes his Quartet West recording debut after replacing the legendary LA based drummer\, Laurence Marable five years ago as Marable is in failing health. The 12-track album includes six salient instrumentals that complement the six moving vocal performances. With two exceptions\, the sessions were recorded live with strings in New York and Los Angeles.	0

Official music video for the remake of "Cool Jerk" (here cleverly retitled "Cool Jerk '90") that was recorded for the Go-Go's 1990 Greatest Hits album (cleverly title 'Greatest').  The track was produced by frequent Prince collaborator David Z. who was fresh off having a U.S. number one hit with the Fine Young Cannibals "She Drives Me Crazy"\, however the producer's signature drum snare loop sound and highly produced style didn't really mesh well with the organic pop/rock sound the Go-Go's were known for and the single tanked upon release in the Fall of 1990.   Today\, the track is often looked at with much disdain by many Go-Go's fans (and most likely) some band members themselves. However\, the video is a treat in many ways...it does have a colorful\, slick feel to it that pops out at you\, and it IS entertaining to see some of the awkward dance moves the poor band members were forced to endure. While singer Belinda Carlisle seems most comfortable with this task\, poor Gina Schock is forced to dance the cool jerk AND bang the drum at the same time..and the result is pure entertainment GOLD.   Fun fact: The video version of this song is actually a 'remix' of the remixed/remade Cool Jerk ('90) that appears on the album 'Greatest'.	0

La Foule  El éxito internacional de"Que nadie sepa mi sufrir"originalmente compuesta por el argentino Ángel Cabral en 1936\, con letra de Enrique Dizeo en ritmo de vals criollo como se le conoce en Argentina\, comenzó en 1953\, en oportunidad de la presentación en el Teatro Ópera de Buenos Aires\, de  la cantante francesa Édith Piaf\, quien escucha una grabación de Alberto Castillo. Esta inolvidable intérprete escuchó el valsecito y se lo llevó a su país. Ya en París\, convocó al autor Michel Rivgauche\, quien le cambió la letra por completo y el título\, así nació La Foule\, que en francés significa La Multitud. La transformación resultó un éxito extraordinario desde que fue publicada en 1957.  La letra original está claramente destinada a ser cantada por un hombre que ha sido abandonado por su amante\, mientras que la canción de Edith Piaf mantiene la angustia en el contexto de una chica aturdida que conoce un hombre en medio de una multitud para perderlo casi de inmediato.  www.carlostangodj.com	0

COL title VAL Sack of Woe COL performer VAL George Benson	COL video title VAL THE BIRDIES- "THE HUCKLEBUCK '65" (1965) COL channel name VAL funknroll COL description VAL "Start a little movement in your WOH-WOH-WOH!"  "The Hucklebuck" was a Big Band and Jump Jive standard from the 40's. Everybody had a variation of it in their repertoire. The reason was that 'hucklebuck' was a euphemism for something the latter part of it rhymed with. When couples trysted to it on the dancefloor\, band leaders knew how to swing that sexual energy. It survived into Rock'n'Roll through versions like Chubby Checker's\, which may be where the Birdies learned to shake a tailfeather.   The "Girls In the Garage" CD I culled it from was no help for any info about them. (Where are Alec Palao or Lois Wilson when you need them? Hopefully making the all-girls NUGGETS box set of my dreams!) But a fan informed me they were another guise of Darlene Love & the Blossoms! Ms. Love is legendary for her chameleonic turns behind the mike under different names: The Crystals ("He's a Rebel"); Bobb B. Soxx & the Blue Jeans; and the K-C-Ettes\, behind guitarist Al Casey ("Surfin' Hootenanny"). Darlene had a funny story of evading producer Phil Spector when he was mad at her for working other studios under aliases\, but now that story sounds really ominous. Darlene is also famous for portraying Danny Glover's wife in the 'Lethal Weapon' movies\, and is just as potent a performer today.    To have a Movement\, ya gotta move first. Rock propelled the hips before it prodded people to be hip in awareness. As Feminism would soon declare\, "the personal is political".  Just the act of freeing your body\, your inhibitions\, your appearance\, your choice of partner\, or your choice of music was tantamount to a political action. In a turbulent time when the youth were starting to question everything about any arbitrary boundaries\, every move they made away from these was rebellion. No neat little boxes for them. More like a spectrum of rooms to explore and exceed. In this moment\, the air is electric with the tension of possibility...

Well\, if you're a Roy Drusky fan\, probably so. If you asked me if the album works as a whole\, I'd say no. Roy's still at the top of his game in the later stages of his career\, but most of these pop tunes just don't translate well to a country setting (like The Beatles' "Yesterday"\, which DOES NOT work as a country tune so stop trying\, dammit!). This cover of the #4 1964 Gerry And The Pacemakers hit isn't too bad\, so it's worth a listen.	0

The album was recorded at Wally Heider Recording\, San Francisco over the course of two days\, September 28th-29th\, 1971.  This song\, written by Don Nix\, was originally done by Moloch in 1969. It closes side 1 and emerges as my favourite on the LP. Van Morrison appears casually\, and plays his part in an intriguing 10 minutes\, impressive for its spontaneity and heady mix of instrumentation. John Lee and Van would meet sporadically on several occasions in the decades which followed\, both live and in the studio.  Playing on this one were: John Lee Hooker (vocals\, guitar); Van Morrison (vocals\, guitar); Don "Sugarcane" Harris (violin); Steve Miller (electric piano); Mark Naftalin (piano); Robert Hooker (organ); Elvin Bishop (slide guitar); Gino Skaggs (fender bass) and Chuck Crimelli (drums).  Nine of them - it's like a blues orchestra! Must have been a big studio :-)  The LP is reviewed on my Album Chart of 1973: http://thejukeboxrebel.wikidot.com/album-chart-of-1973	0

De la mano de Mitch Miller\, director artístico de la casa Columbia\, aplicó el inexorable principio de que\, cuantos peores eran los arreglos y las letras de los temas\, mas beneficio económico para la discográfica. onsiguió grabar un par de duets con Frank Sinatra en 1950 y a partir de ahí le sobrevino la fama y la popularidad. Tuvo su propio show televisivo e incluso Hollywood llamó a su puerta para que participara junto a Bing Crosby y Danny Kaye en algunas comedias musicales siendo la mas celebre el film de Michael Curtiz\, "White Christmas".No obstante lo dicho\, Rosemary Clooney\, se acercó tardíamente al jazz y grabó una par de magníficos álbumes para Columbia: "The Best Of Hollywood" con la orquesta del trompetista\, Harry James\, y "Blue Rose"\, su obra mas conseguida y un disco que pudo ser memorable con la orquesta de Duke Ellington. Es la tía sanguínea del actual actor George Clooney.  Dámaso Pérez Prado (Matanzas\, Cuba\, 11 de diciembre de 1916 - Ciudad de México\, 14 de septiembre de 1989)\, el "Rey del Mambo"\, fue un músico\, compositor y arreglista cubano.Dámaso Pérez Prado es mayormente conocido por sus aportes al género del mambo\, que tiene sus orígenes en el danzón cubano y daría pauta al surgimiento y desarrollo del chachachá.Pasado el clímax del mambo\, es llamativo que Dámaso Pérez Prado\, una vez compuesta su pieza musical "Patricia" y obtenido su éxito correspondiente\, la grabase muchas veces y con diferentes arreglos\, actitud que parece demostrar que tuvo por dicha pieza una especial predilección. Entre sus composiciones más conocidas se encuentran Qué rico el mambo y Mambo Nº 5\, ésta última después lanzada en una nueva versión en 1999 por el cantante alemán Lou Bega.

COL title VAL Most Likely You Go Your Way and I'll Go Mine COL performer VAL Robben Ford	COL video title VAL Maud Powell - (Coleridge-Taylor/Powell) Deep River COL channel name VAL 2ndviolinist COL description VAL Maud Powell (August 22\, 1867  January 8\, 1920) IMHO the best American violinist.  MAUD POWELL - A Pioneer's Legacy by Karen A. Shaffer (edited to fit) Maud Powell was born on August 22\, 1867\, in Peru\, Illinois\, on the western frontier in the American heartland. Her grandparents had been Methodist missionaries in Ohio\, Wisconsin\, and Illinois before the Civil War. Her father William Bramwell Powell was an innovative educator; superintendent of the public schools in Peru\, then Aurora\, IL\, and finally Washington\, D.C. Her mother Minnie Paul Powell was a pianist and composer whose gender precluded a career. Minnie and Bramwell's sisters were active in the woman's suffrage movement. Maud's uncle John Wesley Powell\, Civil War hero and explorer of the Grand Canyon\, organized the scientific study of the western lands and the native Indians as the powerful director of the U.S. Geological Survey and Bureau of Ethnology and founder of the National Geographic Society.  A prodigy\, Powell began violin and piano study in Aurora\, Illinois\, then studied violin four years with William Lewis in Chicago\, to whom she "owed the most." She completed her training with Europe's greatest masters -- Henry Schradieck in Leipzig\, Charles Dancla in Paris\, and Joseph Joachim in Berlin. Returning to the United States knowing that "girl violinists were looked upon with suspicion\," Powell boldly walked into a rehearsal of the all-male New York Philharmonic in Steinway Hall and demanded a hearing from Theodore Thomas\, then America's foremost conductor. Deeply impressed\, Thomas acknowledged his "musical grandchild" and hired her on the spot to perform the Bruch G minor violin concerto with the New York Philharmonic on November 14\, 1885. New York critic Henry E. Krehbiel acclaimed the 18-year-old's debut performance: "She is a marvellously gifted woman\, one who in every feature of her playing discloses the instincts and gifts of a born artist."  The young violinist pioneered the violin recital as she blazed new concert circuits throughout the country\, even braving the primitive touring conditions in the Far West to reach people who had never heard a concert before. She explained: "I do not play to them as an artist to the public\, but as one human being to another." Theodore Thomas chose Maud Powell to represent America's achievement in violin performance at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. During the 1893 Exposition\, Powell presented a paper to the Women's Musical Congress\, "Women and the Violin\," in which she encouraged young women to take up the violin seriously. At a time when women could not vote and were precluded from playing in professional orchestras\, she argued that there was no reason why a woman should not play the violin with the best of the men.  Powell herself had proved to the world that a woman could play the violin as well as a man\, fulfilling the shared hopes of her mother and woman suffrage leaders Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Her example inspired young girls to take up the violin and women to form music clubs and orchestras throughout the land.  Powell became one of America's most revered and beloved musicians while her 1907 recording of Drdla's Souvenir became the most popular violin record of its day.  Maud Powell toured Europe\, North America and South Africa to wide acclaim\, appearing with the great orchestras of her time under such conductors as Mahler\, Nikisch\, Thomas\, Safonov\, Damrosch\, Seidl\, Richter\, Wood\, Herbert and Stokowski.  Perhaps Powell's greatest artistic triumph was her American premiere (November 30\, 1906) of the Sibelius Violin Concerto\, which she glowingly described as "a gigantic rugged thing\, an epic really....It is on new lines and has a new technique. O\, it is wonderful." Powell introduced fourteen violin concertos to the American public -- by Tchaikovsky\, Dvořák\, Saint-Saëns\, Lalo\, Sibelius\, Coleridge-Taylor\, Arensky\, Aulin\, Huss\, Shelley\, Conus\, Bruch and Rimsky-Korsakov. She also revived neglected works of the 18th century\, including Mozart's Sinfonia Concertante for violin and viola\, and even edited a Locatelli violin sonata for publication. She boldly championed works by American composers. Maud Powell died the year the 19th Amendment granting national suffrage to women was ratified. Upon her death on January 8\, 1920\, the New York Symphony paid tribute to this "supreme and unforgettable artist": "She was not only America's great master of the violin\, but a woman of lofty purpose and noble achievement\, whose life and art brought to countless thousands inspiration for the good and the beautiful." © Karen A.

The song is found on the finale number of the play's first act\, and performed by the character of Albin Mougeotte\, first played by George Hearn. The song was composed in 1983 by Jerry Herman\, an openly gay man.  The song has since been covered by the likes of Dame Shirley Bassey\, Gloria Gaynor\, Marti Webb\, Joannie Taylor\, Carol Jiani\, Amanda Lear\, Hannah Jones\, Soraya Arnelas\, Ken Page\, Gerard-Rene-Gordon\, Doug Shneider\, Teatro\, Linda Eder\, John Barrowman\, Amateur Transplants\, Karen Mulder and Anthony Warlow.  I Am What I Am was the only studio album recorded by Shirley Bassey for the Towerbell Records label\, several other tracks were also recorded at this label and issued as singles only. The recording sessions took place at Olympic Studios\, Barnes\, London\, in July and August 1984. Following the success of the previous album All by Myself this album peaked at number 25 in the UK album chart and reached Gold status.   This release was the first digitally recorded album made by Shirley Bassey and was issued on vinyl\, cassette and CD. Consisting of mainly re-recordings from Shirley Bassey's back catalogue and two new songs\, this album was recorded 'live' with The London Symphony Orchestra\, conducted by Carl Davies. The album also reunited Shirley Bassey with Norman Newell\, who had served successfully as her producer throughout the 1960s.  LYRICS: I am what I am I am my own special creation So come take a look Give me the hook or the ovation It's my world That I want to have a little pride in My world And it's not a place I have to hide in Life's not worth a damn Till you can say I am what I am  I am what I am I don't want praise I don't want pity I bang my own drum Some think it's noise I think it's pretty And so what if I love each sparkle and each bangle Why not try to see things from a different angle Your life is a sham Till you can shout out I am what I am  I am what I am And what I am needs no excuses I deal my own deck Sometimes the aces sometimes the deuces It's one life and there's no return and no deposit One life so it's time to open up your closet Life's not worth a damn till you can shout out I am what I am	0

COL title VAL Brazil COL performer VAL Les Paul	COL video title VAL Otis Redding - A Change Is Gonna Come COL channel name VAL REBEL SONGBIRD COL description VAL As I would not be a slave\, so I would not be a master. This expresses my idea of democracy.  ~Abraham Lincoln~  Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.  ~Martin Luther King Jnr~  Let every nation know\, whether it wishes us well or ill\, that we shall pay any price\, bear any burden\, meet any hardship\, support any friend\, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.  ~John F. Kennedy~  I believe that\, as long as there is plenty\, poverty is evil.  ~Robert F. Kennedy~  I'm not claiming divinity. I've never claimed purity of soul. I've never claimed to have the answers to life. I only put out songs and answer questions as honestly as I can... But I still believe in peace\, love and understanding.  ~John Lennon~  OTIS REDDING  LYRICS: I was born by a river in this little old tent Oh just like this river I've been running ever since It's been a long\, long time coming But I know\, but I know a change is gotta come Oh yes it is On my!  It's been too hard living\, oh my And I'm afraid to die I don't know what's up there Beyond the clouds  It's been a long long time coming But I know\, but I know a change is gotta come Oh yes it is On my!  There was a time I would go to my brother I asked my brother\, "Will you help me please?" He turned me down and then I ask my dear mother\, oh I said "Mother!" I said "Mother! I'm down on my knees"   It's been a time that I thought Lord this couldn't last for very long But somehow I thought I was still able to try to carry on It's been a long\, long time coming But I know a change is gonna come Oh\, yes it is  Just like I said\, I went to my little bitty brother\, my littele brother I asked my brother "Brother help me please?" He turned me down and then I go to my little mother\, my dear mother I said "Mother!" I said "Mother! I'm down on my knees"   But there was a time that I thought Lord this couldn't last for very long But somehow I thought I was still able to try to carry on It's been a long\, long time coming But I know\, but I know a change is gotta come Oh yes it will  So tired of standing by myself You know that I know that a change is gotta come  Artist: Otis Redding Album: Otis Blue Year: 1965 Song: A Change Is Gonna Come	0
COL title VAL September Song COL performer VAL The Magnificent Men	COL video title VAL Hoagy Carmichael - Memphis In June COL channel name VAL Shapelander COL description VAL Last night I uploaded Harry Nilsson's "Thursday" because it reminds me of fall\, and down here in Texas its hot as hell. I wake up craving crisp autumn mornings. It's weather that will make you feel like a strawberry (reference to Lady Salvia). Anyway\, Memphis in June reminds me of that\, too\, despite what an obviously lazy summer song it is\, so here it is. I could only find a video with some dude playing it on guitar\, and he was badass\, but I really dig Hoagy Carmichael's voice and style. Check out "Two Sleepy People." Someone uploaded it to Youtube with a bunch of pictures of little dogs\, haha. Hoagy Carmichael is great in it\, but Ella Logan steals the show.	0

Draper (25 enero 1923 hasta 28 marzo 2003)\,  conocido profesionalmente como Rusty Draper \, era un cantante americano de Pop que logró su mayor éxito en la década de 1950.  Nacido en Kirksville\, Missouri (el apodo de "Rusty" era por su pelo rojo) comenzó a actuar en el programa de radio de su tío en Tulsa \, Oklahoma a mediados de la década de 1930. Draper pasó a trabajar en las estaciones de radio en Des Moines \, Iowa  (veces tomando el lugar del locutor deportivo Ronald Reagan) \, y en Illinois antes de instalarse en California . Allí comenzó a cantar en  clubes \, convirtiéndose en el cantante oficial del casino de San Francisco . A principios de la década de 1950 había empezado a aparecer en programas de televisión nacionales\, incluyendo The Ed Sullivan Show (CBS) y Ozark Jubilee (ABC).  En 1952\, Draper firmó con Mercury Records y lanzó su primera grabación  \, "How Could You (ojos azules)". Al año siguiente\, después de una gira nacional de clubes\, su versión de  Jim Lowe's "Gambler's Guitar" 's llegó al N º 6 en las listas de éxitos de todo el paçis\, y vendió un millón de copias\, consiguiendo  un disco de oro.  Tras una serie de éxitos menores\, volvió a lo más alto en 1955 con "Seventeen" (N º 18)\, "El Shifting\, Whispering Sands" (N º 3) y "Are You Satisfied?" (No. 11)\, convirtiéndose en uno de los cantantes  de pop  con más éxito de la época.  En 1962\, firmó con con Monument Records \, con cada vez menos éxito en las listas ya que su estilo se fue quedando anticuado. Sin embargo\, él continuó teniendo éxitos menores durante la década de 1960.  Apareció en musicales de teatro y en la televisión\,  Draper murió de neumonía \, en Bellevue\, Washington \, a la edad de 80 años.

COL title VAL Angels We Have Heard on High COL performer VAL Josh Wilson	COL video title VAL Michael McDonald - Angels We Have Heard On High COL channel name VAL thatMimosaGrove COL description VAL 1st track from "In the Spirit: A Christmas Album" (2001). Everything a Michael McDonald fan could want from a holiday album by one of the greatest blue-eyed soul vocalists of all time.  It's firmly within the tradition of latter-day Doobies records and early McDonald solo efforts\, resulting in a really pleasing sound\, equal parts classic soft rock and classy pop-soul\, but there are some differences that give it its own character.  First of all\, there is a reason why the album is released on MCA Nashville\, and there are some hints of contemporary country on songs like "On This Night" and in the arrangement of "Angels We Have Heard on High."  Even stronger is the sense of reverence and underpinning of religion and love of family (his wife and child both sing on the record) that give the album a welcome emotional grounding that informs even the songs that revive his classic sound.  This surge of emotion combines with a high sense of craft and some really good seasonal and religious material that finds McDonald writing some of his strongest songs in a long time ("To Make a Miracle\," the cheerfully insistent "House Full of Love\," the swaggering "Every Time Christmas Comes Around\," and "One Gift\," co-written with and featuring James Ingram).  Musically\, this qualifies as a nice\, welcome surprise for McDonald fans\, since it's as good an album as he's done in years (granted\, he was a little inactive in the '90s for various reasons\, but the sentiment remains the same). And it's not just a good Michael McDonald record -- it's one of the best modern holiday albums in a long\, long time.  ~Review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine http://www.allmusic.com/album/in-the-spirit-a-christmas-album-mw0000015895	1

COL title VAL Gone with the Wind COL performer VAL Julie London	COL video title VAL Giant Steps COL channel name VAL Jazzman 2696 COL description VAL "Giant Steps" is a jazz recording by John Coltrane\, on tenor saxophone\, which is the first track on the album of the same name and is 4 minutes and 49 seconds long. The composition is a milestone for jazz musicians' progress\, given the difficulty of improvising its rapid progression of chord changes that progress through three keys (see Coltrane changes) shifted by major thirds\, creating an augmented triad.  The saxophonist had previously used this technique on the LP Blue Train on the tunes Moment's Notice and Lazy Bird. Coltrane continued in this vein on a recording with Cannonball Adderley of the standard "Limehouse Blues\," and on his original "Fifth House." He continued to use this approach on other tunes\, such as "Countdown"\, based on the Miles Davis tune "Tune Up"; "26 2" based on Charlie Parker's "Confirmation"; and a reharmonization of the jazz standard "Body and Soul." Songs such as "Naima" and "Like Sonny" also show some harmonic similarity to "Giant Steps." Coltrane continued to employ similar concepts in his soloing during his more open and modal middle period. A Love Supreme features examples of lines based on "Giant Steps" cycles over modal vamps\, to create a Polytonal effect (see modal jazz).  The progression continues to stimulate harmonic thinking in contemporary jazz. There are a number of different approaches to soloing on the song. While Coltrane favoured arpeggiation over the changes\, other players have used different tricks and patterns to bring out the sound of the changes. The chord progression was later used by Freddie Hubbard as a basis for his composition "Dear John" (on Hubbard's 1991 album Bolivia). Covers have been recorded by such artists as Rahsaan Roland Kirk\, Pat Metheny\, Buddy Rich\, Jaco Pastorius\, Mike Stern\, Greg Howe\, Tommy Flanagan (who played on the original recording)\, McCoy Tyner\, Kenny Werner\, Kenny Garrett\, Woody Herman\, and Taylor Eigsti\, Gary Bartz. The song was recorded by Chaka Khan in 1982 as part of the "Be Bop Medley" from her album "Chaka Khan".  John Coltrane was known for coming into the studio with unrehearsed songs - "Giant Steps" was no exception. On the original recording\, Tommy Flanagan (piano) played a choppy start-stop solo where it sounds like he is struggling to improvise over Coltrane changes without adequate preparation. Flanagan would revisit Giant Steps on several recordings later in his career and mastered the progression. In some of the alternate takes\, Cedar Walton is at the piano\, declining to take a solo and also playing at a slower tempo than the takes with Flanagan.	0

COL description VAL Long\, Long Time~ Music & Lyrics by: Gary White~ Performed by: Mindy McCready~  Here's one of my favorite love songs\, in the country music category\, "Long\, Long Time\,"  recorded by the young country artist\, Mindy McCready. This song belongs to the album "Mindy McCready: Super Hits\," which was released in January of 2000.  My three other favorite songs from Mindy are "You'll Never Know\," "Oh Romeo\," and "Ten Thousand Angels\," which also can be found in the same album.  "Long\, Long Time" is actually a classic love song that was first recorded and made famous in 1970 by one of the hottest female artists of the 70's\, Linda Ronstadt. "Long\, Long Time" earned Linda her first Grammy nomination (for Best Contemporary Vocal Performance/Female).  "Long\, Long Time" is a tearjerker\, a sad love song\, written for the lonely hearts... living in the memory of a love that never was... Listen to the melody and the lyrics and you'll know what I mean--they are "hauntingly"...good.  ´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´ A Message from WhiteLibraTexas:  WhiteLibraTexas is a YouTube partner.

COL title VAL Unchained Melody COL performer VAL Patti Page	COL video title VAL Julie London - Gone With The Wind (Liberty Records 1955) COL channel name VAL RoundMidnightTV COL description VAL "Gone with the Wind" is a popular song. The music was written by Allie Wrubel\, the lyrics by Herb Magidson. The song was published in 1937. A version recorded by Horace Heidt was a #1 song in 1937. Diane E. Holloway\, who has written extensively on American popular songs\, indicates that the title was inspired by the 1936 publication of the novel Gone with the Wind\, and the timing indicates that this is likely. But the lyrics have no connection to the subject matter of the novel\, and this song should not be confused with any of the music featured in the 1939 film adaptation.  Julie London (September 26\, 1926 – October 18\, 2000) was an American singer and actress\, whose career spanned more than 40 years. Born in Santa Rosa\, California to vaudevillian parents\, London was discovered while working as an elevator operator in downtown Los Angeles\, and began her career as an actress. London's 35-year acting career began in film in 1944\, and included roles as the female lead in numerous Westerns\, co-starring with Rock Hudson in The Fat Man (1951)\, with Robert Taylor and John Cassavetes in Saddle the Wind (1958)\, and opposite Robert Mitchum in The Wonderful Country (1959).  In the mid-1950s\, she signed a recording contract with the newly established Liberty Records\, and released a total of 32 albums of pop and jazz standards during the 1950s and 1960s\, with her signature song being "Cry Me a River"\, which she introduced in 1955. London was noted by critics for her husky\, smoky voice and languid vocal style. She released her final studio album in 1969\, but achieved continuing success playing the female starring role of Nurse Dixie McCall\, in the television series Emergency! (1972–79)\, in which she appeared opposite her real-life husband\, Bobby Troup. The show was produced by her ex-husband\, Jack Webb.  A shy and introverted woman\, London rarely granted interviews\, and spent the remainder of her life out of the public sphere. In 1995\, she suffered a stroke\, which left her with permanent health problems\, and died five years later of a heart attack.  Julie's accompanied by Ray Leatherwood (bass)\, and Barney Kessel (guitar).  Gone with the wind Gone like a leaf that has blown away Gone with the wind My romance has flown away  Yesterday's kisses are still on my lips  I had a lifetime of heaven at my fingertips   But now all is gone Gone is the rapture that thrilled my heart Gone with the wind Gone is the gladness that filled my heart  Just like a flame\, love burned brightly  Then became an empty smoke dream that has gone\,  Gone with the wind  Gone with the wind Gone with the wind Gone with the wind	0

Draper (25 enero 1923 hasta 28 marzo 2003)\,  conocido profesionalmente como Rusty Draper \, era un cantante americano de Pop que logró su mayor éxito en la década de 1950.  Nacido en Kirksville\, Missouri (el apodo de "Rusty" era por su pelo rojo) comenzó a actuar en el programa de radio de su tío en Tulsa \, Oklahoma a mediados de la década de 1930. Draper pasó a trabajar en las estaciones de radio en Des Moines \, Iowa  (veces tomando el lugar del locutor deportivo Ronald Reagan) \, y en Illinois antes de instalarse en California . Allí comenzó a cantar en  clubes \, convirtiéndose en el cantante oficial del casino de San Francisco . A principios de la década de 1950 había empezado a aparecer en programas de televisión nacionales\, incluyendo The Ed Sullivan Show (CBS) y Ozark Jubilee (ABC).  En 1952\, Draper firmó con Mercury Records y lanzó su primera grabación  \, "How Could You (ojos azules)".

Tras una serie de éxitos menores\, volvió a lo más alto en 1955 con "Seventeen" (N º 18)\, "El Shifting\, Whispering Sands" (N º 3) y "Are You Satisfied?" (No. 11)\, convirtiéndose en uno de los cantantes  de pop  con más éxito de la época.  En 1962\, firmó con con Monument Records \, con cada vez menos éxito en las listas ya que su estilo se fue quedando anticuado. Sin embargo\, él continuó teniendo éxitos menores durante la década de 1960.

COL title VAL Working Class Hero COL performer VAL The King	COL video title VAL The Sweet Inspirations - Let It Be Me COL channel name VAL Kerith Louisa Williams-Catton COL description VAL Info: The Sweet Inspirations were an American R&B girl group mostly known for their work as backup singers on studio recordings for other R&B and rock artists. A founding member of the group was Dionne Warwick\, who was later replaced by her aunt\, Cissy Houston. The Sweet Inspirations was founded by former members of The Drinkard Singers\, a long-running Gospel singing group whose membership included Cissy Houston (née Drinkard\, and mother of Whitney Houston\, 1963) and Lee Warwick\, who was Cissy's sister and the mother of Sweet Inspirations members Dee Dee and Dionne Warwick). As a backup group\, the Sweet Inspirations were in high demand among producers\, publishers\, artists\, and songwriters in the early 1960s. The original lineup included Doris Troy and the two Warwick sisters Dionne & Dee Dee. Sylvia Shemwell (sister of Judy Clay) replaced Troy\, while Cissy Houston took over from Dionne\, with Dee Dee Warwick as the group's official leader. The group sang backup for many stars\, including Solomon Burke\, Aretha Franklin\, Wilson Pickett\, and Esther Phillips. Dee Dee left in 1965\, when her solo career began to take off. She was replaced by Myrna Smith. Estelle Brown joined the team soon after\, and the line-up that was to become an Atlantic recording group was set. The Sweet Inspirations recorded by themselves for the first time in April 1967 for Atlantic Records. That session produced the first two singles released by Atlantic\, a version of "Why (Am I Treated So Bad)\," a song previously recorded by The Staple Singers and a soulful version of "Let It Be Me"\, a French song which had been a pop and R&B hit for Betty Everett & Jerry Butler in 1964.	0

COL title VAL Embraceable You COL performer VAL Ginger Rogers & Allen Kearns	COL video title VAL Nat King Cole - Wouldn't It Be Loverly COL channel name VAL uschisfly COL description VAL "...I started out to become a jazz pianist; in the meantime I started singing and I sang the way I felt and that's just the way it came out."  Nathaniel Adams Coles (March 17\, 1919 -- February 15\, 1965)\, known professionally as Nat King Cole\, was an American musician who first came to prominence as a leading jazz pianist. He owes most of his popular musical fame to his soft baritone voice\, which he used to perform in big band and jazz genres. He was one of the first black Americans to host a television variety show\, and has maintained worldwide popularity since his death.  Cole was a smoker of Kool menthol cigarettes\, believing that smoking up to three packs a day gave his voice its rich sound (Cole would smoke several cigarettes in rapid succession before a recording). He died from lung cancer on February 15\, 1965\, at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica\, California.  One of the last albums Nat recorded prior to his death was a collection of songs from Lerner & Lowe's "My Fair Lady" as a tribute to the enthusiasm his fans showed whenever he toured England. "Wouldn't It Be Loverly" was recorded on Sep\, 17\, 1963.  Lyrics: All I want is a room somewhere Far away from the cold night air With one enormous chair Oh\, wouldn't it be loverly?  Lots of chocolate for me to eat Lots of coal makin' lots of heat Warm face\, warm hands\, warm feet Oh\, wouldn't it be loverly?  Oh so loverly sittin' abso-bloomin'-lutely still I would never budge till Spring crept over mi window sill  Someone's head restin' on my knee Warm and tender as he can be Who takes good care of me Oh\, wouldn't it be loverly?  Oh so loverly sittin' abso-bloomin'-lutely still I would never budge till Spring crept over mi window sill  Someone's head restin' on my knee Warm and tender as he can be Who takes good care of me Oh\, wouldn't it be loverly?

COL title VAL The Final Countdown COL performer VAL Europe	COL video title VAL AT LAST ~ Charlie Spivak & His Orchestra (1942) COL channel name VAL MrRJDB1969 COL description VAL "At Last" ~ Charlie Spivak & His Orchestra w/ Garry Stevens & The Stardusters  (1942)  Columbia Records #36642 Flip side of\, "People Like You And Me"   Charlie Spivak was often billed as "The Sweetest Trumpet In The World" . In my opinion\, Spivak\, Harry James\, & Billy Butterfield & a few others\, were probably some of the best "sweet" trumpet players to come out of the "Big Band Era" .  He started out in the early 1920's and by the time he formed his orchestra in 1939\, he had already played with such orchestra's fronted by \, Paul Specht\, Ben Pollack\, The Dorsey Brother's\, Bob Crosby\,  Tommy Dorsey\, & Jack Teagarden.  The Stardusters \, consisting of Glen Gaylon\, Curt Purnell\, & Dick Wylder started out as a trio while still in high school and upon graduation \, they decided to follow their dreams of a vocal career\, instead of attending Yale.  By 1939 and after several guest appearances\, they landed their very own radio program on NBC.  June Hutton \, Ina Ray Hutton's younger sister and once member of The Quintones vocal group\,   joined the original Stardusters in approx. 1940 and the group was complete.  They recorded WHEN I SEE AN ELEPHANT FLY\, AT LAST\, I SURRENDER DEAR\, A WEEKEND IN HAVANA\, THIS IS NO LAUGHING MATTER\, BROTHER BILL\, &  I REMEMBER YOU and a few others with Charlie Spivak's Orchestra. They later recorded with several popular vocalists of the day\, including  Evelyn Knight\, with whom they recorded the 1949 hit \, A LITTLE BIRD TOLD ME.	0

COL title VAL Make You Feel My Love COL performer VAL Neil Diamond	COL video title VAL Dinah Shore -- They Didn't Believe Me COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Dinah Shore  Frances Rose Shore (Winchester\, 1 de marzo de 1917 - Beverly Hills\, 24 de febrero de 1994)\, conocida como Dinah Shore\, fue una cantante estadounidense de jazz y música popular. Fraguada en las big bands de los años treinta\, Dinah se convirtió en los cuarenta en una de las artistas más populares de los Estados Unidos gracias a su interpretación de numerosos éxitos musicales\, como "Buttons and Bows"\, "The Gypsy" y "I´ll Walk Alone"\, y en años sucesivos gracias a su aparición en varios programas televisivos. Nacida en el rural del estado de Tennessee\, Dinah Shore trabajó en la radio de Nashville ya cuando era adolescente. Su carrera profesional se inició más tarde en Nueva York donde cantó con Xavier Cugat. Tras fallidas audiciones para trabajar con Benny Goodman y Tommy Dorsey\, se decidió por convertirse en una cantante individual. Firmó con Bluebird en 1940-1941\, grabó varios éxitos\, entre los que figuran "Yes\, My Darling Daughter"\, "I Hear a Rhapsody" y "Jim". En 1942 vendió un millón de ejemplares del tema "Blues in the Night". Firmó luego con la compañía RCA Victor y obtuvo un nuevo gran éxito con "You´d Be So Nice to Come Home To" y\, sobre todo\, en 1944 con "I´ll Walk Alone". Trabajó también en algunas películas\, como por ejemplo en 1944 en Up in Arms y en 1946 en Till the Clouds Roll By. Entre 1946 y 1949 destacan temas como "The Gypsy"\, "I Love You for Sentimental Reasons"\, "Anniversary Song"\, "I Wish I Didn´t Love You So"\, "Buttons and Bows" y "Dear Hearts and Gentle People". En los cincuenta fue famosa más que por su música por su espectáculo televisivo de variedades The Dinah Shore Chevy Show\, medio en el que trabajaría de forma irregular hasta los años ochenta. Murió de un cáncer.   iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/es/album/a-wonderful-guy/id879697670 Spotify: http://open.spotify.com/album/5mkWSBfR3EWhh6EKdGEGpo Síguenos en: Spotify: https://goo.gl/raouHQ Facebook: https://goo.gl/L92BHL Instagram: https://goo.gl/3oYDGH Web: http://www.vintagemusic.es   Compra nuestros Cd's en formato físico en estas plataformas: Ebay:  http://stores.ebay.com/VintageMusicFm BoutiqAlia: www.boutiqalia-vintagemusic.com Discogs: https://www.discogs.com/es/seller/vintagemusicfm/profile	0

COL title VAL Pick Me Up on Your Way Down COL performer VAL Millie Jackson	COL video title VAL DAVID RUFFIN -"RAINY NIGHT IN GEORGIA" (1971) COL channel name VAL MANNY MORA COL description VAL It's well known that Motown recorded more material than it could release\, but its reasons for shelving material remain a mystery to this day. Ever since the CD reissue boom of the late '80s\, this unreleased material has begun to trickle out of the vaults\, and when it does surface in such forms as the dynamite double-disc set A Cellarful of Motown!\, the music is so good it's hard to believe that it never was released at the time. Knowing this\, it should not come as a complete surprise that former Temptations lead singer David Ruffin had a full\, completed album shelved in 1971\, but hearing Hip-O Select's excavation of that album on the 2004 release David: The Unreleased Album\, it's still a wonder that this record sat in the vaults for over three decades\, with very few of the songs recorded during the sessions appearing on other records and compilations over the years. Far from being unreleasable\, David (titled as such because the album was never given a proper title -- it was given a catalog number and track sequencing\, with David Ruffin penciled in as its name\, but that was used as the title for his 1973 album) finds Ruffin at a solo peak\, not just a singer but in terms of material. He cut the 12 songs that comprised the album\, along with the seven bonus tracks from the same sessions that fill out this CD reissue\, in late 1969 and 1970\, after he had a big solo hit with "My Whole World Ended (The Moment You Left Me)\," with the intent of releasing the album in 1971. There were a pair of covers of recent hits -- an appropriately heartbroken and seductive "Rainy Night in Georgia" and a rather revelatory "I Want You Back\," which added real grit to the Jackson 5's effervescent smash -- but most of this was material written for Ruffin and it played to his strengths. While this music was rooted in Motown's signature sound and performed by the Funk Brothers\, it also looked beyond Detroit\, adding heavy doses of funk\, psychedelia\, and smooth soul\, filled with galvanizing horns\, driving guitars\, down-n-dirty clavinets\, flourishes of electric sitar\, fuzz tones\, and wah-wah guitars\, all grounded by Ruffin's earthy testifying and tied together by top-notch songwriting. All these elements wound up sounding much hipper than much of the music officially released by Motown in the early 1970\, when Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye were just beginning to break free of the studio's formula\, and while David and its accompanying bonus tracks are not a masterpiece along the lines of Talking Book or What's Going On (or even Where I'm Coming From\, for that matter)\, it's vibrant\, exciting music that still sounds fresh -- arguably fresher than full-length Temptations albums of the late '60s -- which qualifies it as a lost classic of sorts. Why was it lost\, consigned to the vaults for nearly three and a half decades? According to the liner notes\, nobody really knows. Ruffin wasn't popular among the executives at Motown in the early '70s\, and he was also going through a number of well-documented personal problems\, so it's possible that Motown simply didn't want to promote him at the time\, but it's also true that the label had a number of great records\, including Marvin's What's Going On\, to release in 1971\, and Ruffin had two LPs out in 1970\, including a duet album with his brother Jimmy\, so the market may have been saturated. We'll likely never know the reason why David was buried\, but fortunately it has been unearthed\, and it's a reason for hardcore soul and Motown fans to celebrate.	0

"The Hucklebuck" was a Big Band and Jump Jive standard from the 40's. Everybody had a variation of it in their repertoire. The reason was that 'hucklebuck' was a euphemism for something the latter part of it rhymed with. When couples trysted to it on the dancefloor\, band leaders knew how to swing that sexual energy. It survived into Rock'n'Roll through versions like Chubby Checker's\, which may be where the Birdies learned to shake a tailfeather.   The "Girls In the Garage" CD I culled it from was no help for any info about them. (Where are Alec Palao or Lois Wilson when you need them? Hopefully making the all-girls NUGGETS box set of my dreams!) But a fan informed me they were another guise of Darlene Love & the Blossoms! Ms. Love is legendary for her chameleonic turns behind the mike under different names: The Crystals ("He's a Rebel"); Bobb B. Soxx & the Blue Jeans; and the K-C-Ettes\, behind guitarist Al Casey ("Surfin' Hootenanny"). Darlene had a funny story of evading producer Phil Spector when he was mad at her for working other studios under aliases\, but now that story sounds really ominous. Darlene is also famous for portraying Danny Glover's wife in the 'Lethal Weapon' movies\, and is just as potent a performer today.    To have a Movement\, ya gotta move first. Rock propelled the hips before it prodded people to be hip in awareness. As Feminism would soon declare\, "the personal is political".  Just the act of freeing your body\, your inhibitions\, your appearance\, your choice of partner\, or your choice of music was tantamount to a political action. In a turbulent time when the youth were starting to question everything about any arbitrary boundaries\, every move they made away from these was rebellion. No neat little boxes for them. More like a spectrum of rooms to explore and exceed. In this moment\, the air is electric with the tension of possibility...

COL title VAL We'll Gather Lilacs COL performer VAL Clare Teal	COL video title VAL DAVID RUFFIN -"RAINY NIGHT IN GEORGIA" (1971) COL channel name VAL MANNY MORA COL description VAL It's well known that Motown recorded more material than it could release\, but its reasons for shelving material remain a mystery to this day. Ever since the CD reissue boom of the late '80s\, this unreleased material has begun to trickle out of the vaults\, and when it does surface in such forms as the dynamite double-disc set A Cellarful of Motown!\, the music is so good it's hard to believe that it never was released at the time. Knowing this\, it should not come as a complete surprise that former Temptations lead singer David Ruffin had a full\, completed album shelved in 1971\, but hearing Hip-O Select's excavation of that album on the 2004 release David: The Unreleased Album\, it's still a wonder that this record sat in the vaults for over three decades\, with very few of the songs recorded during the sessions appearing on other records and compilations over the years. Far from being unreleasable\, David (titled as such because the album was never given a proper title -- it was given a catalog number and track sequencing\, with David Ruffin penciled in as its name\, but that was used as the title for his 1973 album) finds Ruffin at a solo peak\, not just a singer but in terms of material. He cut the 12 songs that comprised the album\, along with the seven bonus tracks from the same sessions that fill out this CD reissue\, in late 1969 and 1970\, after he had a big solo hit with "My Whole World Ended (The Moment You Left Me)\," with the intent of releasing the album in 1971. There were a pair of covers of recent hits -- an appropriately heartbroken and seductive "Rainy Night in Georgia" and a rather revelatory "I Want You Back\," which added real grit to the Jackson 5's effervescent smash -- but most of this was material written for Ruffin and it played to his strengths. While this music was rooted in Motown's signature sound and performed by the Funk Brothers\, it also looked beyond Detroit\, adding heavy doses of funk\, psychedelia\, and smooth soul\, filled with galvanizing horns\, driving guitars\, down-n-dirty clavinets\, flourishes of electric sitar\, fuzz tones\, and wah-wah guitars\, all grounded by Ruffin's earthy testifying and tied together by top-notch songwriting. All these elements wound up sounding much hipper than much of the music officially released by Motown in the early 1970\, when Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye were just beginning to break free of the studio's formula\, and while David and its accompanying bonus tracks are not a masterpiece along the lines of Talking Book or What's Going On (or even Where I'm Coming From\, for that matter)\, it's vibrant\, exciting music that still sounds fresh -- arguably fresher than full-length Temptations albums of the late '60s -- which qualifies it as a lost classic of sorts. Why was it lost\, consigned to the vaults for nearly three and a half decades? According to the liner notes\, nobody really knows. Ruffin wasn't popular among the executives at Motown in the early '70s\, and he was also going through a number of well-documented personal problems\, so it's possible that Motown simply didn't want to promote him at the time\, but it's also true that the label had a number of great records\, including Marvin's What's Going On\, to release in 1971\, and Ruffin had two LPs out in 1970\, including a duet album with his brother Jimmy\, so the market may have been saturated. We'll likely never know the reason why David was buried\, but fortunately it has been unearthed\, and it's a reason for hardcore soul and Motown fans to celebrate.	0

Sarah's accompanied by Hal Mooney & His Orchestra.  Recorded in 1958. (Mercury Records)  Sadly this song right here hits home for me...bitter sweet!  I don't care if there's powder on my nose  I don't care if my hairdo is in place  I've lost the very meaning of repose  I never put a mud pack on my face   Oh\, who'd have thought that I'd walk in a daze  Now I never go to shows at night but just to matinees  Now I see the show and home I go   Once I laughed when I heard you saying  That I'd be playing solitaire  Uneasy in my easy chair  It never entered my mind   Once you told me I was mistaken  That I'd awaken with the sun  And order orange juice for one  It never entered my mind   You have what I lack myself  And now I even have  To scratch my back myself   Once you warned me that if you scorned me  I'd sing the maiden's prayer again  And wish that you were there again  To get into my hair again\, it never entered my mind	0

In 1955\, the unique makeup of the group caught the attention of Atlantic Records  and the Sensations began a three year association with Atlantic's Atco subsidiary. The first two singles by the Sensations were old standards that were given major musical overhaul.    In November\, 1955 the Sensations first single "Yes Sir\, That's My Baby" was released and by February 18\, 1956 it had reached #15 on the R&B charts. On November 17\, 1955 they appeared at Philadelphia Town Hall with Ray Charles.  The follow up to "Ain't She Sweet" was released on April 14\, 1956 reaching #13 R&B in May. These were followed by "My Heart Cries For You\," "Little Wallflower\," "Kiddy Car Love\,"and "My Debut To Love."  When the Atco contract expired Yvonne retired to marry (Yvonne Baker) and raise a family.  In 1961\, Howell feeling that vocal groups were once again in demand convinced Baker to re-form the Sensations. Tenor Richard Curtain and baritone Sam Armstrong were added\, and the group convinced local Philadelphia disc jockey Kae Williams to manage them. William's arranged a record deal with Chess Record's Argo subsidiary. The Sensations recorded "Music\, Music\, Music" which reached #54 Pop and #12 R&B in the summer of 1961. It was their first R&B hit in five years and first Pop hit ever.  In the winter of 1961\, the Sensations  came out with the Baker written "Let Me In." "Let Me In" became their biggest hit reaching #2 Pop and #2 R&B in early 1962.  As so often happens after a major hit\, the Sensations couldn't record any follow up hits to sustain their momentum. "That's My Desire" made it to #69 in 1962 and there were two more Argo releases along with several on William's own Junior label. But nothing could bring the group back. Yvonne Baker latter attempted a solo career.  home.gif (2894 bytes)	0

COL title VAL Try a Little Tenderness COL performer VAL Jack Lemmon	COL video title VAL Torero Band [Tijuana Christmas] Sound of Brass - Hark! The Herald Angels Sing [HQ Audio] COL channel name VAL choccystarfish1 COL description VAL Dance to your favourite Carols with the wonderful 'Sound of Brass' !  Oh the memories this provokes!  Hope some others of you had to endure this in your childhood!  [Sleeve notes]  Christmas is the most joyful festival of the Christian year\, when we celebrate at the same time the turning point of winter and the new hope that was brought to men with the birth of Jesus.  Christmas is a time when we make up for the bleakness of the weather outside with the warmth of our spirits and it is no coincidence that the songs which have become particularly associated with Christmas should be carols\, which have always been the most cheerful and often the most secular of Christian songs.  On this record you will find your favourite carols in an unfamiliar guise - we've called the album 'Tijuana Christmas'\, but you will hear the mariachi sound taking on a richer and more varied flavour as the Torero Band bring out the charms of our most beautiful carol tunes in imaginative brand new arrangements.  'The Holly & the Ivy' sets the pace with a bright\, sparkling beat that even adds to the gaiety of one of our oldest and liveliest carols; 'Silent Night' a much more recent and a more devout carol\, is given quite a contrasting treatment\, slow and tender.  'Hark! The Herald Angels Sing' sets off again at a brisk\, bouncy pace - and if you feel like dancing\, why not?  It may come as a surprise to you that our oldest carols used to be dances and that the word itself described a form of circular dance.  In the preface to the Oxford Book of Carols you will find carols described as songs with a religious impulse that are simple\, popular and modern.  You'll never have heard them sounding more joyful\, popular or modern than they do on this exciting and original LP. (Blase Machin)	0

COL title VAL St. Louis Blues COL performer VAL Django Reinhardt	COL video title VAL gretchen parlato - ela é carioca @ musig-im-ochsen\, muri COL channel name VAL Stephan Diethelm COL description VAL Gretchen Parlato ist der neue Stern am Himmel des weiblichen Vocal-Jazz. Unterstützt durch das Thelonious Monk Institute und begleitet von einem innovativen und erstklassigen Quartett überzeugt sie nicht nur Kritiker und Medien auf ihrem Heimatkontinent\, sondern macht auch international - ausgesprochen gut - von sich reden.   Gretchen's Stimme ist ihr Hauptinstrument. Sie ist sprichwörtlich wie ein Bambusbaum: sehr biegsam\, aber nicht zerbrechlich. Elegant und grazil überschreitet ihre Stimme alle Grenzen\, denn sie hat sich die Musik verschiedener Kulturen zu eigen gemacht. Ihre Stimme ist ein natürliches Instrument\, was sie bereits früh zu nutzen weiß. Dies beweisen einige Clips auf ihrem neuen Album\, die aufgenommen wurden\, als Gretchen gerade einmal zwei Jahre alt war! So wundert es nicht\, dass die amerikanische Jazz-Legende Wayne Shorter Gretchen Parlato als Vokal-Künstlerin vom Format Frank Sinatras beschreibt\, „weil er und sie als Einzige tatsächlich mit dem Instrument Stimme umgehen können."   Das klingt doch sympathisch! Gretchen Parlato gelingt die ideale Balance zwischen Präzision und Improvisation\, sie ist nicht vorhersehbar und verwischt die Grenzen zwischen Sänger und Musiker\, wenn sie beispielsweise eine Textzeile oder wortlose Improvisationen an unbekannte Orte trägt...   Vier Jahre nach Erscheinen ihres Debutalbums begibt sich In a Dream (2009\, Obliqsound/Soulfood) auf eine spannende Reise\, die sowohl zu Parlatos Eigenkompositionen führt\, als auch zurück zu den Helden ihrer Jugend\, wie Stevie Wonder\, Duke Ellington\, Herbie Hancock oder Wayne Shorter. Begleitet wird sie von einer beeindruckenden Zusammenstellung von erstklassigen Musikern: Lionel Loueke an der Gitarre\, Aaron Parks am Klavier\, Derrick Hodge am elektrischen Bass sowie dem Schlagzeuger Kendrick Scott.   Michele Locatelli\, der Produzent des Albums und Mitbegründer von ObliqSound\, bestätigt\, dass Parlatos Wunsch eine großen Bogen musikalischer Einflüsse abzubilden\, ihren wachen Geist und Ihre breite musikalische Sozialisation "verraten" und daher unbedingt unterstützt werden müssen. Er sagt: "Even though her means of expression is jazz-based\, it goes beyond that. The defining thing about her\, however\, is her subtle sense of rhythm and timing: she makes a song seem easy when it's not."

Fraguada en las big bands de los años treinta\, Dinah se convirtió en los cuarenta en una de las artistas más populares de los Estados Unidos gracias a su interpretación de numerosos éxitos musicales\, como "Buttons and Bows"\, "The Gypsy" y "I´ll Walk Alone"\, y en años sucesivos gracias a su aparición en varios programas televisivos. Nacida en el rural del estado de Tennessee\, Dinah Shore trabajó en la radio de Nashville ya cuando era adolescente. Su carrera profesional se inició más tarde en Nueva York donde cantó con Xavier Cugat. Tras fallidas audiciones para trabajar con Benny Goodman y Tommy Dorsey\, se decidió por convertirse en una cantante individual. Firmó con Bluebird en 1940-1941\, grabó varios éxitos\, entre los que figuran "Yes\, My Darling Daughter"\, "I Hear a Rhapsody" y "Jim". En 1942 vendió un millón de ejemplares del tema "Blues in the Night". Firmó luego con la compañía RCA Victor y obtuvo un nuevo gran éxito con "You´d Be So Nice to Come Home To" y\, sobre todo\, en 1944 con "I´ll Walk Alone". Trabajó también en algunas películas\, como por ejemplo en 1944 en Up in Arms y en 1946 en Till the Clouds Roll By. Entre 1946 y 1949 destacan temas como "The Gypsy"\, "I Love You for Sentimental Reasons"\, "Anniversary Song"\, "I Wish I Didn´t Love You So"\, "Buttons and Bows" y "Dear Hearts and Gentle People". En los cincuenta fue famosa más que por su música por su espectáculo televisivo de variedades The Dinah Shore Chevy Show\, medio en el que trabajaría de forma irregular hasta los años ochenta. Murió de un cáncer.   iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/es/album/a-wonderful-guy/id879697670 Spotify: http://open.spotify.com/album/5mkWSBfR3EWhh6EKdGEGpo Síguenos en: Spotify: https://goo.gl/raouHQ Facebook: https://goo.gl/L92BHL Instagram: https://goo.gl/3oYDGH Web: http://www.vintagemusic.es   Compra nuestros Cd's en formato físico en estas plataformas: Ebay:  http://stores.ebay.com/VintageMusicFm BoutiqAlia: www.boutiqalia-vintagemusic.com Discogs: https://www.discogs.com/es/seller/vintagemusicfm/profile	0
COL title VAL Buttons and Bows COL performer VAL Evelyn Knight	COL video title VAL Al Stewart - Pink Panther Theme [Live] COL channel name VAL You Can't Download Vinyl COL description VAL Originally recorded November 24\, 1978 at the studios of WKQX in Chicago for their "Live Studio Jam" program\, during Al Stewart's "Time Passages" tour. Arista pressed 2500 copies of the original LP "for Promotional Use Only."   Eventually some of the songs from this LP found their way onto CD re-releases of Al's albums as "bonus tracks\," and finally the (almost) complete "Blue Album" was released on CD in 2002 by BMG as "Time Passages Live."  Unfortunately\, BMG cut out some of Al's chatter between songs\, including his intro of the band\, so I edited in that part from an MP3 made from the original LP.	0

COL title VAL King Creole COL performer VAL Louise Hoffsten	COL video title VAL The Mountain Ramblers - Jesse James COL channel name VAL mrwonderful COL description VAL Based out of the musically hyperactive mountain area of Galax\, VA\, this band's early recordings are considered as important to the early beginnings of bluegrass as the first records by mandolinist Bill Monroe and his Bluegrass Boys. Bandleader James Lindsey preferred describing his group as playing mountain music\, making the name Mountain Ramblers descriptive not only of the band's geographical home base but of their musical style\, which evolved with various changes in direction and membership over more than 20 years. By maintaining its existence over such an extended period of time\, the group became to classic bluegrass what combos such as the Drifters or the Coasters are to rhythm & blues and doo-wop\, although the mountain music genre seems to have inspired a trifle less franchising and band-cloning.

For anyone of that time who was not aware of the guitarist\, the unaccompanied introduction might make them think that they were hearing a classical player. Yet\, as Django slides into a slow-walk tempo and the opening melody of "St. Louis Blues"\, there is no doubt that his heart lies in jazz. He makes effective use of bent notes in the opening chorus\, and his flashy but tasteful runs add dramatic contrast. When he goes to the tango section\, he adds to the drama with strong lines in parallel octaves. The tempo picks up as the band returns to the blues choruses\, and Reinhardt's final chorus is marked by block chords and one of his trademarked guitar rolls. When Grappelli enters\, Reinhardt steals the spotlight back with his unique accompanying style featuring choppy block chords and rolls at the turnarounds.	1

He just needed the world-renowned guitarist and singer John Pizzarelli to make it.  “I got an idea got in my head\,” McCartney wrote to Pizzarelli in late May 2014.  “It might be interesting for you to do a few of my songs that are lesser known than some of the others. I realize this may be a little immodest\, if not pushy.” “I imagine the songs would include post-Beatles melodies of mine like ‘Love in the Open Air’ (from the soundtrack to 1967 film The Family Way)\, ‘Junk\,’ ‘Warm and Beautiful’ and\, possibly\, ‘My Valentine.’”  “My Valentine” was the one McCartney composition on his album of songs from the '30s and '40s\, Kisses on the Bottom (MPL/Hear Music/Concord). Pizzarelli played guitar on the album and backed Sir Paul on a handful of prestigious live performances\, including the GRAMMY Awards\, MusiCares Person of the Year gala and the initial iTunes/Apple TV live broadcast. Hailed as one of the prime contemporary interpreters of the Great American Songbook\, Pizzarelli has expanded his repertoire by performing the music of Joni Mitchell\, Neil Young\, Tom Waits\, Antônio Carlos Jobim and Lennon-McCartney.  McCartney concluded in his letter\, “The attraction for me is lesser-known tunes done in a mellow jazz style and\, if it gets some traction\, maybe the album could be titled Midnight McCartney. As I said\, this may tickle your fancy or you may decide these are the ramblings of a deranged composer with too much time on his hands.”  To say Pizzarelli was tickled is putting it mildly.	1
COL title VAL Poison Ivy COL performer VAL The Nylons	COL video title VAL HEY JUDE (The Beatles) - THE 12 CELLISTS OF THE BERLIN PHILHARMONIC COL channel name VAL TheQuietStorm11 COL description VAL "Hey Jude" is a song by the English rock band The Beatles\, written by Paul McCartney and credited to Lennon--McCartney. The ballad evolved from "Hey Jules"\, a song widely accepted as being written to comfort John Lennon's son\, Julian\, during his parents' divorce—although this explanation is not universally accepted and even McCartney has given conflicting accounts over the years "Hey Jude" begins with a verse-bridge structure based around McCartney's vocal performance and piano accompaniment; further instrumentation is added as the song progresses to distinguish sections. After the fourth verse\, the song shifts to a fade-out coda that lasts for more than four minutes. "Hey Jude" was released in August 1968 as the first single from The Beatles' record label Apple Records. More than seven minutes in length\, "Hey Jude" was\, at the time\, the longest single ever to top the British charts.It also spent nine weeks as number one in the United States—the longest run at the top of the American charts for a Beatles' single\, and tied the record for longest stay at number one (until the record was broken by "You Light Up My Life"). The single has sold approximately eight million copies and is frequently included on professional lists of the all-time best songs. From Wikipedia\, the free encyclopedia	0

In the meantime\, however\, a relatively unknown group called The Bards\, from Moses Lake\, Washington\, recorded the number and released it in January 1969 on the Jerden label (Jerden 907) and a few months later on the Parrot label (Parrot 45-337). Elvis did not sing the lines "I got my pills to ease the pain\, Can't find a thing to ease my brain." Well\, that's what you read everywhere\, but according to The Bards' guitarist\, Mardi Sheridan\, the lines were\, in fact\, "Got my pills to ease the pain\, Can't find a thing to ease the rain." The Bards own site : bardsmusic.com   I thank Mike of The Bards for allowing me to put the song on Youtube. Here are some informations he sent me :  'Bards' is an old English word meaning musician\, minstrel\, poet\, or entertainer. The story behind our use of The Bards as the name of our '60's band was wanting to emulate the Beatles (of course\, British musicians). Also\, since we were more into writing music than writing lyrics\, we decided to take some classic poetry and put it to rock music. The story of our band is memorialized here: http://bardsmusic.com'   'The picture you refer to of us was taken in 2002. (for Youtube users: it's the last picture in the video) Wow\, 10 years ago already. There was a 4th Bard\, the drummer\, who passed\, but our reunion was inspired by an interesting series of events. Just for kicks\, back around 2001 I Googled The Bards and found a number of links and information\, including a compilation CD that had one of my songs on it. Of course\, I ordered it and later got a call from a producer who specialized in releasing previously un-released music from the 60's and 70's. He somehow knew about an album of material we had that was produced by the highly successful production team of Curt Boetcher and Keith Olson. We were basically high school kids from a small eastern Washing town called Moses Lake. We went to 'Hollywood' with our 'garage band' tapes\, met Keith and Curt in an elevator and long story short\, ended up with an albums worth of music that never got released because the new label they were trying to start didn't get financing. Anyway\, 35 years later we did release it as a result of that Google search. That's what inspired the Moses Lake Recordings\, The Bards Music web site tribute (where all of this is reported) and that reunion where the picture was taken. Anyway\, I still marvel at how the internet managed to 'transcend' space and time\, bringing that music out of obscurity\, as well as rekindling the relationship of the surviving band members'.

COL title VAL Save the Last Dance for Me COL performer VAL Paul Anka	COL video title VAL "What The World Needs Now Is Love" (1968) The Staple Singers COL channel name VAL Gospel Nostalgia COL description VAL This is track 1 from the 1968 album "What The World Needs Now Is Love". Lead by Mavis Staples Written by Hal David and Burt Bacharach The family began appearing in Chicago-area churches in 1948\, and signed their first professional contract in 1952. During their early career they recorded in an acoustic gospel-folk style with various labels: United Records\, Vee-Jay Records(their "Uncloudy Day" and "Will The Circle Be Unbroken" were best sellers)\, Checker Records\, Riverside Records\, and then Epic Records in 1965. While the family surname is "Staples"\, the group used the singular form for its name\, resulting in the group's name being "The Staple Singers".  It was on Epic that the Staple Singers began moving into mainstream pop markets\, with "Why (Am I Treated So Bad)" and "For What It's Worth" (Stephen Stills) in 1967. In 1968\, the Staple Singers signed to Stax Records and released two albums with Steve Cropper and Booker T & the MG's — Soul Folk in Action and We'll Get Over. By 1970\, Al Bell had become producer\, and with Engineer Terry Manning\, the family began recording at the famed Muscle Shoals Sound Studio\, and Memphis' Ardent Studios\, moving in a more funk and soul direction.  The first Stax hit was "Heavy Makes You Happy (Sha-Na-Boom Boom)". Their 1971 recording of "Respect Yourself"\, written by Luther Ingram and Mack Rice\, peaked at #2 on the R&B charts and was a #12 pop hit as well. The song's theme of self-empowerment had universal appeal\, released in the period immediately following the intense American civil rights movement of the 1960s. In 1972\, the group had a huge #1 hit in the United States with "I'll Take You There". It topped both pop and R&B charts. "If You're Ready (Come Go With Me)" would become another big hit\, reaching #9 pop and #1 on the R&B chart in 1973. Then\, after Stax's bankruptcy in 1975\, they signed to Curtis Mayfield's label\, Curtom Records\, and released "Let's Do It Again"\, produced by Mayfield; the song became their second #1 pop hit in the US and the album also. In 1976\, they collaborated with The Band for their film The Last Waltz\, performing on the song "The Weight" (which The Staple Singers had previously covered on their first Stax album). However\, they were not able to regain their momentum\, releasing only occasional minor hits. Their 1984 album Turning Point featured their final Top 40 hit\, a cover of Talking Heads' "Slippery People" (which also reached the Top 5 on the Dance chart). In 1994\, they again performed the song "The Weight" with Country music artist Marty Stuart for MCA Nashville's Rhythm\, Country and Blues compilation\, somewhat re-establishing an audience. The song "Respect Yourself" was used by Spike Lee in the soundtrack to his movie Crooklyn\, made in 1994.  In 1999\, the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Pops Staples died of complications from a concussion suffered in December 2000. In 2005\, the group was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Mavis Staples has continued to carry on the family tradition and continues to add her vocal talents to both the projects of other artists and her own solo ventures. Cleotha Staples died in Chicago on February 21\, 2013\, after suffering from Alzheimer's disease for over a decade.	0

This is proven true\, given the fact that I recently discovered her albums—and I just haven't had my fill. I've searched and purchased everything I could find from such a gifted songstress. Lorez crafts each lyric with such grace and tonality that could easily match (if not surpass) the reigning jazz stylists of the bop/jazz/pop age. She gives each standard a new sense of evocative meaning as far as lyrics are concerned\, and reinvents the wheel each time she unleashes her enthralling voice. As she once said "A lyric is dead\, until you breathe life into it." This is exactly what she does. Enjoy and listen in HD\, to the lovely—Lorez Alexandria.

COL title VAL You Don't Know Me COL performer VAL Steve Marriott	COL video title VAL Giant Steps COL channel name VAL Jazzman 2696 COL description VAL "Giant Steps" is a jazz recording by John Coltrane\, on tenor saxophone\, which is the first track on the album of the same name and is 4 minutes and 49 seconds long. The composition is a milestone for jazz musicians' progress\, given the difficulty of improvising its rapid progression of chord changes that progress through three keys (see Coltrane changes) shifted by major thirds\, creating an augmented triad.  The saxophonist had previously used this technique on the LP Blue Train on the tunes Moment's Notice and Lazy Bird. Coltrane continued in this vein on a recording with Cannonball Adderley of the standard "Limehouse Blues\," and on his original "Fifth House." He continued to use this approach on other tunes\, such as "Countdown"\, based on the Miles Davis tune "Tune Up"; "26 2" based on Charlie Parker's "Confirmation"; and a reharmonization of the jazz standard "Body and Soul." Songs such as "Naima" and "Like Sonny" also show some harmonic similarity to "Giant Steps." Coltrane continued to employ similar concepts in his soloing during his more open and modal middle period. A Love Supreme features examples of lines based on "Giant Steps" cycles over modal vamps\, to create a Polytonal effect (see modal jazz).  The progression continues to stimulate harmonic thinking in contemporary jazz. There are a number of different approaches to soloing on the song. While Coltrane favoured arpeggiation over the changes\, other players have used different tricks and patterns to bring out the sound of the changes. The chord progression was later used by Freddie Hubbard as a basis for his composition "Dear John" (on Hubbard's 1991 album Bolivia). Covers have been recorded by such artists as Rahsaan Roland Kirk\, Pat Metheny\, Buddy Rich\, Jaco Pastorius\, Mike Stern\, Greg Howe\, Tommy Flanagan (who played on the original recording)\, McCoy Tyner\, Kenny Werner\, Kenny Garrett\, Woody Herman\, and Taylor Eigsti\, Gary Bartz. The song was recorded by Chaka Khan in 1982 as part of the "Be Bop Medley" from her album "Chaka Khan".  John Coltrane was known for coming into the studio with unrehearsed songs - "Giant Steps" was no exception. On the original recording\, Tommy Flanagan (piano) played a choppy start-stop solo where it sounds like he is struggling to improvise over Coltrane changes without adequate preparation. Flanagan would revisit Giant Steps on several recordings later in his career and mastered the progression. In some of the alternate takes\, Cedar Walton is at the piano\, declining to take a solo and also playing at a slower tempo than the takes with Flanagan.	0

Official music video for the remake of "Cool Jerk" (here cleverly retitled "Cool Jerk '90") that was recorded for the Go-Go's 1990 Greatest Hits album (cleverly title 'Greatest').  The track was produced by frequent Prince collaborator David Z. who was fresh off having a U.S. number one hit with the Fine Young Cannibals "She Drives Me Crazy"\, however the producer's signature drum snare loop sound and highly produced style didn't really mesh well with the organic pop/rock sound the Go-Go's were known for and the single tanked upon release in the Fall of 1990.   Today\, the track is often looked at with much disdain by many Go-Go's fans (and most likely) some band members themselves. However\, the video is a treat in many ways...it does have a colorful\, slick feel to it that pops out at you\, and it IS entertaining to see some of the awkward dance moves the poor band members were forced to endure. While singer Belinda Carlisle seems most comfortable with this task\, poor Gina Schock is forced to dance the cool jerk AND bang the drum at the same time..and the result is pure entertainment GOLD.   Fun fact: The video version of this song is actually a 'remix' of the remixed/remade Cool Jerk ('90) that appears on the album 'Greatest'.	0

COL title VAL Little Girl Blue COL performer VAL Diana Ross	COL video title VAL Sam Cooke - Little Girl Blue (original vinyl rip) 1961 COL channel name VAL smazexd COL description VAL When we decided to do a "blues" album with Sam Cooke\, we got together dozens of publishers' folders containing the old blues tunes that have become semi-classics of the business. As we pored over these one evening with Sam\, we could see something troubling him. To our question\, Sam answered\, "these songs are all right\, I guess\, but they're not my kinda blues."  To understand this statement\, you have to understand a little bit about Sam Cooke. He is a young man. He has been brought up in a new generation of music\, and within this new music\, he has created his own style and sound. Sam Cooke is gifted with that rare ability to be an individual performer and interpreter of music. Still\, his repertoire is drawn from the music of the past decade or so\, music that he has grown up with and that he knows best.  Sam Cooke has found the blues in the most unexpected of all places . . . right in our own backyard\, so to speak. He has taken the current standards that we have danced or hummed to so many times\, without thinking of the lyrical meaning\, and has given them a fresh meaning. What could be sadder\, really\, than a young man pleading\, "Don't Get Around Much Anymore..." or\, "Nobody Knows When You're Down And Out." Many a time\, a crowded dance floor has been happily jumping with the sounds of Out In The Cold Again\, or But Not For Me\, with not one couple thinking about the message contained in these songs\, Sam Cooke makes you think about it as he digs deep into the lyric and gives you the message in no uncertain terms. Chances are\, you will think of these tunes as "blues" from now on. And they are\, as Sam says... "That's my kinda blues."	1

COL title VAL After the Lights Go down Low COL performer VAL Lyn Stanley	COL video title VAL Nat King Cole - Wouldn't It Be Loverly COL channel name VAL uschisfly COL description VAL "...I started out to become a jazz pianist; in the meantime I started singing and I sang the way I felt and that's just the way it came out."  Nathaniel Adams Coles (March 17\, 1919 -- February 15\, 1965)\, known professionally as Nat King Cole\, was an American musician who first came to prominence as a leading jazz pianist. He owes most of his popular musical fame to his soft baritone voice\, which he used to perform in big band and jazz genres. He was one of the first black Americans to host a television variety show\, and has maintained worldwide popularity since his death.  Cole was a smoker of Kool menthol cigarettes\, believing that smoking up to three packs a day gave his voice its rich sound (Cole would smoke several cigarettes in rapid succession before a recording). He died from lung cancer on February 15\, 1965\, at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica\, California.  One of the last albums Nat recorded prior to his death was a collection of songs from Lerner & Lowe's "My Fair Lady" as a tribute to the enthusiasm his fans showed whenever he toured England. "Wouldn't It Be Loverly" was recorded on Sep\, 17\, 1963.  Lyrics: All I want is a room somewhere Far away from the cold night air With one enormous chair Oh\, wouldn't it be loverly?  Lots of chocolate for me to eat Lots of coal makin' lots of heat Warm face\, warm hands\, warm feet Oh\, wouldn't it be loverly?  Oh so loverly sittin' abso-bloomin'-lutely still I would never budge till Spring crept over mi window sill  Someone's head restin' on my knee Warm and tender as he can be Who takes good care of me Oh\, wouldn't it be loverly?  Oh so loverly sittin' abso-bloomin'-lutely still I would never budge till Spring crept over mi window sill  Someone's head restin' on my knee Warm and tender as he can be Who takes good care of me Oh\, wouldn't it be loverly?

Well\, if you're a Roy Drusky fan\, probably so. If you asked me if the album works as a whole\, I'd say no. Roy's still at the top of his game in the later stages of his career\, but most of these pop tunes just don't translate well to a country setting (like The Beatles' "Yesterday"\, which DOES NOT work as a country tune so stop trying\, dammit!). This cover of the #4 1964 Gerry And The Pacemakers hit isn't too bad\, so it's worth a listen.	0

COL title VAL Small Fry COL performer VAL Rusty Draper	COL video title VAL gretchen parlato - ela é carioca @ musig-im-ochsen\, muri COL channel name VAL Stephan Diethelm COL description VAL Gretchen Parlato ist der neue Stern am Himmel des weiblichen Vocal-Jazz. Unterstützt durch das Thelonious Monk Institute und begleitet von einem innovativen und erstklassigen Quartett überzeugt sie nicht nur Kritiker und Medien auf ihrem Heimatkontinent\, sondern macht auch international - ausgesprochen gut - von sich reden.   Gretchen's Stimme ist ihr Hauptinstrument. Sie ist sprichwörtlich wie ein Bambusbaum: sehr biegsam\, aber nicht zerbrechlich. Elegant und grazil überschreitet ihre Stimme alle Grenzen\, denn sie hat sich die Musik verschiedener Kulturen zu eigen gemacht. Ihre Stimme ist ein natürliches Instrument\, was sie bereits früh zu nutzen weiß. Dies beweisen einige Clips auf ihrem neuen Album\, die aufgenommen wurden\, als Gretchen gerade einmal zwei Jahre alt war! So wundert es nicht\, dass die amerikanische Jazz-Legende Wayne Shorter Gretchen Parlato als Vokal-Künstlerin vom Format Frank Sinatras beschreibt\, „weil er und sie als Einzige tatsächlich mit dem Instrument Stimme umgehen können."   Das klingt doch sympathisch! Gretchen Parlato gelingt die ideale Balance zwischen Präzision und Improvisation\, sie ist nicht vorhersehbar und verwischt die Grenzen zwischen Sänger und Musiker\, wenn sie beispielsweise eine Textzeile oder wortlose Improvisationen an unbekannte Orte trägt...   Vier Jahre nach Erscheinen ihres Debutalbums begibt sich In a Dream (2009\, Obliqsound/Soulfood) auf eine spannende Reise\, die sowohl zu Parlatos Eigenkompositionen führt\, als auch zurück zu den Helden ihrer Jugend\, wie Stevie Wonder\, Duke Ellington\, Herbie Hancock oder Wayne Shorter. Begleitet wird sie von einer beeindruckenden Zusammenstellung von erstklassigen Musikern: Lionel Loueke an der Gitarre\, Aaron Parks am Klavier\, Derrick Hodge am elektrischen Bass sowie dem Schlagzeuger Kendrick Scott.   Michele Locatelli\, der Produzent des Albums und Mitbegründer von ObliqSound\, bestätigt\, dass Parlatos Wunsch eine großen Bogen musikalischer Einflüsse abzubilden\, ihren wachen Geist und Ihre breite musikalische Sozialisation "verraten" und daher unbedingt unterstützt werden müssen. Er sagt: "Even though her means of expression is jazz-based\, it goes beyond that. The defining thing about her\, however\, is her subtle sense of rhythm and timing: she makes a song seem easy when it's not."

COL title VAL When Day Is Done COL performer VAL Buddy Johnson and His Orchestra	COL video title VAL Les Elgart And His Orchestra -- When Day Is Done COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Les Elgart (3 de agosto\, 1917\, New Haven\, Connecticut - 29 de julio\, 1995\, Dallas\, Texas) fue un director de orquesta de jazz swing y trompetista.  Lester E. (Les) Elgart comenzó a tocar la trompeta cuando era un adolescente\, y con 20 años de edad había ya realizado conciertos profesionales. En la década de 1940 tocó en las bandas dirigidas por Raymond Scott\, Charlie Spivak\, y Harry James\, y de vez en cuando en  bandas junto con el hermano Larry. Juntos crean la suya propia "Les & Larry Elgart Ensemble" en 1945\, y contratan a Nelson Riddle\, Ralph Flanagan\, y Bill Finegan para  hacer arreglos.  La unión fue efímera\, sin embargo\, debido a la huelga de Músicos de la Unión  y la disminución de la popularidad del jazz de Swing\, se separaron en 1946. En 1952\, el dúo se reunió y publicó un número importante de álbumes en Columbia Records\, muchos de considerable éxito de ventas.  Entre sus canciones más conocidas es "Bandstand Boogie"\, que fue utilizado por Dick Clark como la canción de "American Bandstand. Más tarde\, en la década de 1950 Les alejado de los negocios y la manipulación del grupo puso fin a la banda.  Les siguió trabajando hasta su muerte por insuficiencia cardíaca en Dallas\, Texas en 1995.

COL title VAL Peg O' My Heart COL performer VAL Charles Harrison	COL video title VAL Kirk Whalum - Someday We'll All Be Free COL channel name VAL RobertoCastillo2184 COL description VAL Everything Is Everything: A Tribute To Donny Hathaway is Kirk Whalum's second album in 2010. In March\, he released The Gospel According to Jazz: Chapter III\, his first recording in two years\, with a star-studded lineup.  Everything Is Everything features 11 tunes closely associated with the late singer\, songwriter and pianist. Hathaway recorded 10 of them himself; the other he wrote for Blood Stone. Whalum is joined by a stellar cast who include John Stoddart on Fender Rhodes\, Shedrick Mitchell on organ\, guitarists Jef Lee Johnson and Larry Campbell\, bassist Christian McBride\, percussionist Bashiri Johnson\, and drummer John Roberts. (Guest appearances by Rick Braun\, Jeff Golub\, and Robert Randolph round it out.) This is a primarily instrumental set\, recorded in a polished but old-school\, 1970s Funky Soul Jazz style — nearly CTI in production approach with some fine vocal performances sweetening the deal. Musiq Soulchild lends his mellifluous tenor to the slow-burning "We're Still Freinds\," and Hathaway's daughter Lalah graces the silky babymaker "You Had to Know."  Whalum evokes his best Grover Washington\, Jr. on the kick-off track "Giving Up\," and the lyric influence of fellow Memphian David Fathead Newman is heard on "Someday We'll All Be Free\," featuring a lovely\, tastefully articulated string arrangement by Gil Goldstein. The recording of Leon Russell's "Song for You" is a real highlight here\, as Whalum references Hathaway's vocal phrasing on his tenor. Goldstein's strings are up in the mix but aren't intrusive. "Valdez in the Country" digs deeper into Hathaway's original to bring the Latin polyrhythms to the fore\, and Golub's guitar solo is a monster — adding grit to the interplay between the rhythm section and percussionists. "Je Vous Aime (I Love You)\," one of two cuts here written by Hathaway with Leroy Hutson\, features a female gospel chorus.  Randolph's pedal steel on "Tryin' Times" adds some nasty to this funky number. "Voices Inside (Everything Is Everything)" closes it with Stoddart taking an incidental lead vocal backed by a chorus\, as Braun and Randolph round out the core band. Andy Snitzer's programming (this is the only cut it appears on) is minimal; making it suitable for the dancefloor and remixing. McBride's electric bass is the driving force\, and the chorus is chilling in its emotional reach. Whether intended or not\, Whalum's range of musical creativity on Everything Is Everything: A Tribute to Donny Hathaway\, while keeping it grounded in the singer's ouevre\, makes this the album by which the saxophonist will be judged from here on out.

He probably recorded the first version in 1967\, either for the Jerden label\, or for Piccadilly\, but it was not released; then came a version on the Cotillion label in 1971; finally O'Keefe recorded his hit version for the Signpost label in 1972. In the meantime\, however\, a relatively unknown group called The Bards\, from Moses Lake\, Washington\, recorded the number and released it in January 1969 on the Jerden label (Jerden 907) and a few months later on the Parrot label (Parrot 45-337). Elvis did not sing the lines "I got my pills to ease the pain\, Can't find a thing to ease my brain." Well\, that's what you read everywhere\, but according to The Bards' guitarist\, Mardi Sheridan\, the lines were\, in fact\, "Got my pills to ease the pain\, Can't find a thing to ease the rain." The Bards own site : bardsmusic.com   I thank Mike of The Bards for allowing me to put the song on Youtube. Here are some informations he sent me :  'Bards' is an old English word meaning musician\, minstrel\, poet\, or entertainer. The story behind our use of The Bards as the name of our '60's band was wanting to emulate the Beatles (of course\, British musicians).

Just for kicks\, back around 2001 I Googled The Bards and found a number of links and information\, including a compilation CD that had one of my songs on it. Of course\, I ordered it and later got a call from a producer who specialized in releasing previously un-released music from the 60's and 70's. He somehow knew about an album of material we had that was produced by the highly successful production team of Curt Boetcher and Keith Olson. We were basically high school kids from a small eastern Washing town called Moses Lake. We went to 'Hollywood' with our 'garage band' tapes\, met Keith and Curt in an elevator and long story short\, ended up with an albums worth of music that never got released because the new label they were trying to start didn't get financing. Anyway\, 35 years later we did release it as a result of that Google search. That's what inspired the Moses Lake Recordings\, The Bards Music web site tribute (where all of this is reported) and that reunion where the picture was taken.

Je voudrais tant que tu te souviennes des jours heureux où nous étions amis en ce temps-là la vie était plus belle\, et le soleil plus brûlant qu'aujourd'hui les feuilles mortes se ramassent à la pelle tu vois\, je n'ai pas oublié... Les feuilles mortes se ramassent à la pelle\, les souvenirs et les regrets aussi et le vent du nord les emporte dans la nuit froide de l'oubli. Tu vois\, je n'ai pas oublié la chanson que tu me chantais. C'est une chanson qui nous ressemble toi\, tu m'aimais et je t'aimais et nous vivions tous deux ensemble toi qui m'aimais\, moi qui t'aimais mais la vie sépare ceux qui s'aiment tout doucement\, sans faire de bruit et la mer efface sur le sable le pas des amants désunis. Les feuilles mortes se ramassent à la pelle\, les souvenirs et les regrets aussi mais mon amour silencieux et fidèle sourit toujours et remercie la vie je t'aimais tant\, tu étais si joli\, comment veux-tu que je t'oublie? En ce temps-là\, la vie était plus belle\, et le soleil plus brûlant qu'aujourd'hui tu étais mon plus douce ami mais je n'ai que faire des regrets et la chanson que tu chantais toujours\, toujours je l'entendrai!

The Creator / Macarthur Park first attempt  The first album Morgan recorded in Londons Pipe Studios (actually a TEAC 4-track recorder set up in his Notting Hill bedsit). This bizarre album was originally conceived (with the collusion of Iain McNay\, Cherry Reds boss) as a spoof compilation album featuring a variety of 'bands' from Peabody\, an obscure little town in Kansas (at that time American towns like Cleveland and Akron were viewed upon as hot-beds of modern rock music). When this concept was stated on the radio and in the press\, quite a number of people believed it! In truth\, it was all made by Morgan. The musical approach was to take songs and perform them in a way that was diametrically opposite to the original version. Here are the original artists who performed (or pre-formed) the songs\, and the styles adopted for these recordings:  1. Richard Harris in the style of The Specials or two-tone. 2. The Sex Pistols in the style of Pinky and Perky (a BBC TV childrens puppet show). 3. Kate Bush in the style of Jah Wobble and reggae/dub. 4. Perry Como in the style of The Sex Pistols and speed punk. 5. Peggy Lee - actually done in a contorted version of her own style. 6. The Brotherhood of Man in the style of Devo. 7. Rod Stewart in a new wave/techno style. 8. Sun Ra - actually an affectionate and slightly twisted version of his own style. 9. The Beatles collaged with a hint of "My Life In The Bush of Ghosts" (Eno/Byrne). 10. The Stranglers in the style of The Residents. 11. The Righteous Brothers in the style of Suicide. 12. Squeeze UK in the style of\, er\, The Residents meet Pink Floyd? Then a segue into Mott the Hoople in the style of an old 78rpm record by the Palm Court Orchestra.	0

COL title VAL There Will Never Be Another You COL performer VAL Joe Harnell	COL video title VAL Nat King Cole - Wouldn't It Be Loverly COL channel name VAL uschisfly COL description VAL "...I started out to become a jazz pianist; in the meantime I started singing and I sang the way I felt and that's just the way it came out."  Nathaniel Adams Coles (March 17\, 1919 -- February 15\, 1965)\, known professionally as Nat King Cole\, was an American musician who first came to prominence as a leading jazz pianist. He owes most of his popular musical fame to his soft baritone voice\, which he used to perform in big band and jazz genres. He was one of the first black Americans to host a television variety show\, and has maintained worldwide popularity since his death.  Cole was a smoker of Kool menthol cigarettes\, believing that smoking up to three packs a day gave his voice its rich sound (Cole would smoke several cigarettes in rapid succession before a recording). He died from lung cancer on February 15\, 1965\, at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica\, California.  One of the last albums Nat recorded prior to his death was a collection of songs from Lerner & Lowe's "My Fair Lady" as a tribute to the enthusiasm his fans showed whenever he toured England. "Wouldn't It Be Loverly" was recorded on Sep\, 17\, 1963.  Lyrics: All I want is a room somewhere Far away from the cold night air With one enormous chair Oh\, wouldn't it be loverly?  Lots of chocolate for me to eat Lots of coal makin' lots of heat Warm face\, warm hands\, warm feet Oh\, wouldn't it be loverly?  Oh so loverly sittin' abso-bloomin'-lutely still I would never budge till Spring crept over mi window sill  Someone's head restin' on my knee Warm and tender as he can be Who takes good care of me Oh\, wouldn't it be loverly?  Oh so loverly sittin' abso-bloomin'-lutely still I would never budge till Spring crept over mi window sill  Someone's head restin' on my knee Warm and tender as he can be Who takes good care of me Oh\, wouldn't it be loverly?

COL title VAL One Love / People Get Ready COL performer VAL CMH Studio Artists	COL video title VAL Li'l Darlin' By Chuck Wayne COL channel name VAL texpaco COL description VAL Having listened to countless other versions over the past 50 years\, this to me is still the definitive rendition of this jazz classic.  Chuck Wayne was a jazz guitarist who first came to prominence in the 1940s.  He is best known for his work with Woody Herman's First Herd\, and for being the first guitarist in the George Shearing quintet.  He also played with trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie and in the '50s he recorded some albums for the Progressive label as a leader.  He released his first albums in 1953\, the best known being "The Jazz Guitarist".  He also was Tony Bennett's music director and accompanist from 1954-1957.  He had a distinctive\, swinging bebop style and developed an unusual legato technique\, not widely adopted by others until decades later.  He also had a lot of non-jazz activities which ranged from writing for Broadway to working as a staff musician for CBS-TV.  In his heyday he worked with many great vocalists including Sarah Vaughn\, Frank Sinatra\, and Barbra Streisand.   While not widely known outside the jazz circles\, he was a major influence on numerous guitarists who imitated his style.  During the 1980s he taught at the Westchester Conservatory of Music in suburban White Plains\, NY.  This Neal Hefti classic is from his album "Morning Mist" released in 1964.  "Morning Mist" was remastered and released as a CD in 2003.	0

COL title VAL Yakety Yak COL performer VAL Ray Stevens	COL video title VAL Sam Cooke - Little Girl Blue (original vinyl rip) 1961 COL channel name VAL smazexd COL description VAL When we decided to do a "blues" album with Sam Cooke\, we got together dozens of publishers' folders containing the old blues tunes that have become semi-classics of the business. As we pored over these one evening with Sam\, we could see something troubling him. To our question\, Sam answered\, "these songs are all right\, I guess\, but they're not my kinda blues."  To understand this statement\, you have to understand a little bit about Sam Cooke. He is a young man. He has been brought up in a new generation of music\, and within this new music\, he has created his own style and sound. Sam Cooke is gifted with that rare ability to be an individual performer and interpreter of music. Still\, his repertoire is drawn from the music of the past decade or so\, music that he has grown up with and that he knows best.  Sam Cooke has found the blues in the most unexpected of all places . . . right in our own backyard\, so to speak. He has taken the current standards that we have danced or hummed to so many times\, without thinking of the lyrical meaning\, and has given them a fresh meaning. What could be sadder\, really\, than a young man pleading\, "Don't Get Around Much Anymore..." or\, "Nobody Knows When You're Down And Out." Many a time\, a crowded dance floor has been happily jumping with the sounds of Out In The Cold Again\, or But Not For Me\, with not one couple thinking about the message contained in these songs\, Sam Cooke makes you think about it as he digs deep into the lyric and gives you the message in no uncertain terms. Chances are\, you will think of these tunes as "blues" from now on. And they are\, as Sam says... "That's my kinda blues."	0

Louis W. "Fuzzy" Kane\, an educator whose popular Fuzzy Kane Trio entertained Baltimoreans for more than 40 years with its easygoing jazz in the Les McCann-Ramsey Lewis idiom\, died May 21 of heart failure at Sinai Hospital. Mr. Kane\, who lived in Strathmore Towers in Northwest Baltimore\, was 79. The son of a chauffeur and a cafeteria worker\, Mr. Kane was born in Baltimore and raised in Catonsville\, where he graduated in 1948 from Benjamin Banneker High School. He earned a bachelor's degree in 1953 from what is now Morgan State University and a master's degree in administration in 1962 from Loyola College.  By Frederick N.

COL title VAL Maybellene COL performer VAL Pat Travers	COL video title VAL Nat King Cole - Wouldn't It Be Loverly COL channel name VAL uschisfly COL description VAL "...I started out to become a jazz pianist; in the meantime I started singing and I sang the way I felt and that's just the way it came out."  Nathaniel Adams Coles (March 17\, 1919 -- February 15\, 1965)\, known professionally as Nat King Cole\, was an American musician who first came to prominence as a leading jazz pianist. He owes most of his popular musical fame to his soft baritone voice\, which he used to perform in big band and jazz genres. He was one of the first black Americans to host a television variety show\, and has maintained worldwide popularity since his death.  Cole was a smoker of Kool menthol cigarettes\, believing that smoking up to three packs a day gave his voice its rich sound (Cole would smoke several cigarettes in rapid succession before a recording). He died from lung cancer on February 15\, 1965\, at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica\, California.  One of the last albums Nat recorded prior to his death was a collection of songs from Lerner & Lowe's "My Fair Lady" as a tribute to the enthusiasm his fans showed whenever he toured England. "Wouldn't It Be Loverly" was recorded on Sep\, 17\, 1963.  Lyrics: All I want is a room somewhere Far away from the cold night air With one enormous chair Oh\, wouldn't it be loverly?  Lots of chocolate for me to eat Lots of coal makin' lots of heat Warm face\, warm hands\, warm feet Oh\, wouldn't it be loverly?  Oh so loverly sittin' abso-bloomin'-lutely still I would never budge till Spring crept over mi window sill  Someone's head restin' on my knee Warm and tender as he can be Who takes good care of me Oh\, wouldn't it be loverly?  Oh so loverly sittin' abso-bloomin'-lutely still I would never budge till Spring crept over mi window sill  Someone's head restin' on my knee Warm and tender as he can be Who takes good care of me Oh\, wouldn't it be loverly?

COL title VAL Rudolph\, the Red-Nosed Reindeer COL performer VAL Patti Page	COL video title VAL Ella Fitzgerald - No Other Love COL channel name VAL Alissa Lovera COL description VAL Talk about a rara avis -- for four decades\, Ella Sings Broadway has been the most obscure and hard to find of Ella Fitzgerald's classic Verve albums. Those who did invest the time and money in unearthing it were amply rewarded: The set is a perfect complement to Fitzgerald's classic series of Song Book albums. Unlike the Song Books\, however\, Ella Sings Broadway concentrates not on the time-honored history of The Great White Way and its stellar songwriters\, but on songs and shows by writers that were part of Broadway's recent past: Rodgers and Hammerstein (South Pacific\, Me and Juliet) Adler and Ross (Damn Yankees\, The Pajama Game)\, Frank Loesser (Guys and Dolls)\, and Lerner and Loewe (Brigadoon\, My Fair Lady).  This overlooked gem of an album was arranged and conducted by Marty Paich\, the man responsible for such other Fitzgerald triumphs as Ella Swings Brightly and Whisper Not -- which places Ella Sings Broadway in most excellent company.  www.vervemusicgroup.com	0
COL title VAL Ela é Carioca COL performer VAL Cris Delanno	COL video title VAL gretchen parlato - ela é carioca @ musig-im-ochsen\, muri COL channel name VAL Stephan Diethelm COL description VAL Gretchen Parlato ist der neue Stern am Himmel des weiblichen Vocal-Jazz. Unterstützt durch das Thelonious Monk Institute und begleitet von einem innovativen und erstklassigen Quartett überzeugt sie nicht nur Kritiker und Medien auf ihrem Heimatkontinent\, sondern macht auch international - ausgesprochen gut - von sich reden.   Gretchen's Stimme ist ihr Hauptinstrument. Sie ist sprichwörtlich wie ein Bambusbaum: sehr biegsam\, aber nicht zerbrechlich. Elegant und grazil überschreitet ihre Stimme alle Grenzen\, denn sie hat sich die Musik verschiedener Kulturen zu eigen gemacht. Ihre Stimme ist ein natürliches Instrument\, was sie bereits früh zu nutzen weiß. Dies beweisen einige Clips auf ihrem neuen Album\, die aufgenommen wurden\, als Gretchen gerade einmal zwei Jahre alt war! So wundert es nicht\, dass die amerikanische Jazz-Legende Wayne Shorter Gretchen Parlato als Vokal-Künstlerin vom Format Frank Sinatras beschreibt\, „weil er und sie als Einzige tatsächlich mit dem Instrument Stimme umgehen können."   Das klingt doch sympathisch! Gretchen Parlato gelingt die ideale Balance zwischen Präzision und Improvisation\, sie ist nicht vorhersehbar und verwischt die Grenzen zwischen Sänger und Musiker\, wenn sie beispielsweise eine Textzeile oder wortlose Improvisationen an unbekannte Orte trägt...   Vier Jahre nach Erscheinen ihres Debutalbums begibt sich In a Dream (2009\, Obliqsound/Soulfood) auf eine spannende Reise\, die sowohl zu Parlatos Eigenkompositionen führt\, als auch zurück zu den Helden ihrer Jugend\, wie Stevie Wonder\, Duke Ellington\, Herbie Hancock oder Wayne Shorter. Begleitet wird sie von einer beeindruckenden Zusammenstellung von erstklassigen Musikern: Lionel Loueke an der Gitarre\, Aaron Parks am Klavier\, Derrick Hodge am elektrischen Bass sowie dem Schlagzeuger Kendrick Scott.   Michele Locatelli\, der Produzent des Albums und Mitbegründer von ObliqSound\, bestätigt\, dass Parlatos Wunsch eine großen Bogen musikalischer Einflüsse abzubilden\, ihren wachen Geist und Ihre breite musikalische Sozialisation "verraten" und daher unbedingt unterstützt werden müssen. Er sagt: "Even though her means of expression is jazz-based\, it goes beyond that. The defining thing about her\, however\, is her subtle sense of rhythm and timing: she makes a song seem easy when it's not."

Obecnou známost a věhlas dal Jevanům právě Karel Gott\, jediná česká šoubyznysová hvězda příhraničního a světového významu. Ten si v roce 1969\, hned na kraji Jevan směrem od kutnohorské silnice\, koupil od rodiny Ročkových vilu pražského továrníka Aloise Köppela z roku 1930. V 80. letech ji ale od Karla Gotta koupil Miroslav Provod\, později známý jako kamarád Františka Mrázka a jeden ze šéfů pražského podsvětí\, který si nedávno odpykal pětiletý trest \, asi ne moc dobré spojení. Vila však po vzájemné dohodě obou mužů zůstala psaná na Gotta\, aby nemusel řadový programátor vysvětlovat\, kde vzal v 80. letech 170 tisíc západoněmeckých marek v hotovosti. V roce 1988 Gott prodal národnímu podniku Narex za zhruba 6 milionů korun\, které pak předal Provodovi\, který se vrátil z vězení a potřeboval peníze. Ale v roce 1996\, i kvůli nevyjasněným smluvním vztahům\, vilu opět od Narexu odkoupil. Ač s přestávkami vlastnil dům přes tři desítky let\, nikdy se zde natrvalo neusídlil. Dům byl sice plně vybaven\, zařízen na život jednoho i více lidí\, ale opravdovým domovem Gottovi nikdy nebyl.  V roce 2005 ji za 11 milionů prodal Janu Moťovskému\, který v ní otevřel muzeum Karla Gott Gottland - což byla skvělá myšlenka a mnoho fanoušků toto ocenilo. Muzeum\, ač na internetu stále „žijí" jeho stránky\, je bohužel už pár let zavřené. Návštěvnost po prvotním okouzlení opadla\, Jan Moťovský zmizel kdesi na Francouzské Riviéře a Gottland tímto chátrá. V současnosti má vila nového majitele\, zatím však na opravy a oživení čeká. Na rozdíl od Karla Gotta se Jevany staly skutečným domovem skladateli Karlu Svobodovi a později i kapelníkovi Ladislavu Štaidlovi. Ti dva měli dokonce své domy na břehu Jevanského rybníka hned vedle sebe. Štaidl se později přestěhoval do Prahy\, vilu obývá jeho syn. Karel Svoboda se na zápraží svého domu v roce 2007 zastřelil.  Chceme vidět Mistra! Právě Gottova vila se stala už v 70. letech 20. století důvodem\, proč Jevany získaly pověst prominentního letoviska a proč se sem od 70. let minulého století táhly zástupy výletníků\, aby zhlédli vilu (a zahlédli za záclonou) a také Mistra. Shodou okolností\, hned přes silnici naproti Gottovi měl víkendovou chatu všemocný František Hrabal\, ředitel Pragokoncertu\, organizace\, který za socialismu provozovala management většině vrcholových umělců z oblasti populární hudby.    Zřejmě se Karel a jeho věrní fanoušci už nedočkají \, obnovení vily a muzea dohromady \, byl to skvělí nápad a však zmařen \, to si Karel Gott nezaslouží \, toto opravdu ne \, dle mě je to ostuda \, budeme však doufat.	0

Lester E. (Les) Elgart comenzó a tocar la trompeta cuando era un adolescente\, y con 20 años de edad había ya realizado conciertos profesionales. En la década de 1940 tocó en las bandas dirigidas por Raymond Scott\, Charlie Spivak\, y Harry James\, y de vez en cuando en  bandas junto con el hermano Larry. Juntos crean la suya propia "Les & Larry Elgart Ensemble" en 1945\, y contratan a Nelson Riddle\, Ralph Flanagan\, y Bill Finegan para  hacer arreglos.  La unión fue efímera\, sin embargo\, debido a la huelga de Músicos de la Unión  y la disminución de la popularidad del jazz de Swing\, se separaron en 1946. En 1952\, el dúo se reunió y publicó un número importante de álbumes en Columbia Records\, muchos de considerable éxito de ventas.  Entre sus canciones más conocidas es "Bandstand Boogie"\, que fue utilizado por Dick Clark como la canción de "American Bandstand. Más tarde\, en la década de 1950 Les alejado de los negocios y la manipulación del grupo puso fin a la banda.  Les siguió trabajando hasta su muerte por insuficiencia cardíaca en Dallas\, Texas en 1995.

Pubblicata nel 1938\, la canzone fu inserita nel musical di Broadway "This Way" \,in cui venne  eseguita dal cantante Tamara Drasin\, che aveva qualche anno prima cantato "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes". Il brano è uno standard jazz\, ed è statoinciso da numerosi artisti nel corso degli anni.

If we could talk to the animals\, learn their languages\, Maybe Take an animal degree\, I'd study elephant and eagle\, buffalo and beagle\, Alligator\, guinea pig\, and flea!  I would converse in polar bear and python\, And I would curse in fluent kangaroo\, If people ask me "can you speak rhinoceros?" I'd say "of courserous! Can't you?"  If I conferred with our furry friends\, man to animal\, Think of the amazing repartee If I could walk with the animals\, talk with the animals\, Grunt and squeak and squawk with the animals\, And they could squeak and skwawk and speak and talk to us!  If I consult with the quadrupeds Think what fun wed have\, asking for the crocodiles for tea! Or maybe lunch with three lions\, walruses and sea lions What a lovely place the world would be!  If I spoke slang to orangutans The advantages any fool on earth could plainly see! Discussing Eastern art and dramas With intellectual llamas Thats a big step forward youll agree!  Id learn to speak in antelope and turtle And my Pekinese would be extremely good If I were asked to sing in hippopotamus Id say whynotamous? and I would!  If I could parlay with pachyderms Its a fairy tale worthy of Hans Anderson and Grimm A man who walks with the animals and talks with the animals Grunts and squeaks and squawks with the animals and they could talk to *me*!   Id study every *living* creatures language So I could speak to all of them on site If friends said can he talk in crab or pelican? Youd say *like hell he can and you'll be right!  And if you just stop to think of it there's no doubt of it I would win a place in history If I could walk with the animals Talk with the animals Grunt no word here squeak and squawk with the animals And they could squeak and squawk and speak and talk to me!	0

Considerati dei ragazzini prodigio\, iniziarono la loro attività concertistica giovanissimi. Prima ancora di ottenere la laurea iniziarono l'attività in duo che portarono avanti assieme per tutta la loro vita. Nel 1947 intrapresero una carriera concertistica a tempo pieno\, prima nei night club\, poi in esibizioni di musica classica con orchestra al seguito. Tra il 1950 e il 1980 furono tra i principali artisti easy listening d'America e ottennero numerosi successi discografici. Fra i loro maggiori successi si possono citare: "Theme From The Apartment"\, "Exodus"\, "Tonight" e "Midnight Cowboy". Essi realizzarono frequenti registrazioni con le maggiori orchestre pop tra le quali si ricordano quelle dirette da George Gershwin\, Jerome Kern\, Cole Porter\, Richard Rodgers ed altre ancora.   ------------------------------------------------------------ Ferrante & Teicher was een Amerikaans pianoduo . Zij waren vooral bekend om hun arrangement van bekende klassieke en filmmuziek.  Arthur Ferrante (New York City\, 7 september - 1921 - 19 september 2009) en Louis Teicher (Wilkes Barre\, 24 augustus 1924 - 3 augustus 2008) leerden elkaar kennen toen zij studeerden aan de "Juilliard School" voor muziek in New York. Beiden waren muzikaal zeer begaafd en begonnen als pianoduo op te treden\, toen ze nog op school zaten. Na hun afstuderen gingen beiden aan de slag aan de Juilliard-faculteit.  In 1947 begonnen zij een voltijdse concertcarrière. Ze speelden eerst in nachtclubs\, maar schakelden al snel over naar het spelen van klassieke muziek met orkestbegeleiding. Tussen 1950 en 1980 waren zij een der belangrijkste Amerikaanse "easy listening"-groepen en scoorden zij vier grote hits: "Theme From The Apartment" (Pop #10)\, "Exodus" (Pop #2)\, "Tonight" (Pop #8)\, and "Midnight Cowboy" (Pop #10). Zij traden op en namen platen op met nummers van George Gershwin\, Jerome Kern\, Cole Porter en Richard Rodgers. In 1973 speelden zij het openingsnummer van het radiodrama The Zero Hour van Rod Sterling. Het duo deed ook aan "avant garde".	1

The  closing theme to 'The Liberace Show' & his on-stage performances.   Note: There is "0"evidence of Liberace being homosexual/gay. He was once engaged to actress Joanne Rio & frequently dated countless other women; not men! He testified (under oath) & denied being homosexual (or ever taken part in homosexual practices) in a 1956 defamation trial against the Daily Mirror. He further won a libel suit (1957) against Confidential Magazine for publishing a malicious article alluding to him being a homosexual. In Liberace's biography 'The Wonderful 'Private' World of Liberace' there is no mention of him being homosexual\, engaging in homosexual practices\, or an affair with Scott Thorson??? Chapter Three does mention his affairs with women. Liberace was not gay!!!	0

COL description VAL Long\, Long Time~ Music & Lyrics by: Gary White~ Performed by: Mindy McCready~  Here's one of my favorite love songs\, in the country music category\, "Long\, Long Time\,"  recorded by the young country artist\, Mindy McCready. This song belongs to the album "Mindy McCready: Super Hits\," which was released in January of 2000.  My three other favorite songs from Mindy are "You'll Never Know\," "Oh Romeo\," and "Ten Thousand Angels\," which also can be found in the same album.  "Long\, Long Time" is actually a classic love song that was first recorded and made famous in 1970 by one of the hottest female artists of the 70's\, Linda Ronstadt. "Long\, Long Time" earned Linda her first Grammy nomination (for Best Contemporary Vocal Performance/Female).  "Long\, Long Time" is a tearjerker\, a sad love song\, written for the lonely hearts... living in the memory of a love that never was... Listen to the melody and the lyrics and you'll know what I mean--they are "hauntingly"...good.  ´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´ A Message from WhiteLibraTexas:  WhiteLibraTexas is a YouTube partner.

Shaw\, who was born in Leicester attended the Trinity College of Music and served in the Royal Air Force in World War II leading RAF No 1 Band of the Middle East Forces. Following wartime service he arranged music for Ted Heath\, Teddy Foster\, Mantovani and many others. He became an arranger and record producer for Decca Records with his orchestra recording for that label and Phase 4 Stereo. His orchestra performed on the albums Mexico and Westward Ho. In December 1964 his orchestra released an album of cover versions of Themes from the James Bond Thrillers to coincide with the American release of Goldfinger. The popularity of Shaw's arrangements of Bond themes led to More Themes from the James Bond Thrillers for the release ofThunderball with tracks from both albums released on a UK album called James Bond in Action. In 1966 Shaw's orchestra performed Themes for Secret Agents.Themes from the James Bond Thrillers Vol.3/More James Bond in Action followed the release of Casino Royale and You Only Live Twice in 1967. Shaw came back in 1971 for The Return of James Bond/The Phase 4 World of Spy Thrillers for the release of Sean Connery's return as Bond in Diamonds Are Forever. Shaw recruited guitarist Vic Flick to repeat his guitar playing on the Gypsy Camp track. Shaw arranged music for films such as Summer Holiday (1963) and The Secret of My Success (1965) and wrote the score for Straight on Till Morning.

Well\, if you're a Roy Drusky fan\, probably so. If you asked me if the album works as a whole\, I'd say no. Roy's still at the top of his game in the later stages of his career\, but most of these pop tunes just don't translate well to a country setting (like The Beatles' "Yesterday"\, which DOES NOT work as a country tune so stop trying\, dammit!). This cover of the #4 1964 Gerry And The Pacemakers hit isn't too bad\, so it's worth a listen.	0

Sarah's accompanied by Hal Mooney & His Orchestra.  Recorded in 1958. (Mercury Records)  Sadly this song right here hits home for me...bitter sweet!  I don't care if there's powder on my nose  I don't care if my hairdo is in place  I've lost the very meaning of repose  I never put a mud pack on my face   Oh\, who'd have thought that I'd walk in a daze  Now I never go to shows at night but just to matinees  Now I see the show and home I go   Once I laughed when I heard you saying  That I'd be playing solitaire  Uneasy in my easy chair  It never entered my mind   Once you told me I was mistaken  That I'd awaken with the sun  And order orange juice for one  It never entered my mind   You have what I lack myself  And now I even have  To scratch my back myself   Once you warned me that if you scorned me  I'd sing the maiden's prayer again  And wish that you were there again  To get into my hair again\, it never entered my mind	0

Official music video for the remake of "Cool Jerk" (here cleverly retitled "Cool Jerk '90") that was recorded for the Go-Go's 1990 Greatest Hits album (cleverly title 'Greatest').  The track was produced by frequent Prince collaborator David Z. who was fresh off having a U.S. number one hit with the Fine Young Cannibals "She Drives Me Crazy"\, however the producer's signature drum snare loop sound and highly produced style didn't really mesh well with the organic pop/rock sound the Go-Go's were known for and the single tanked upon release in the Fall of 1990.   Today\, the track is often looked at with much disdain by many Go-Go's fans (and most likely) some band members themselves. However\, the video is a treat in many ways...it does have a colorful\, slick feel to it that pops out at you\, and it IS entertaining to see some of the awkward dance moves the poor band members were forced to endure. While singer Belinda Carlisle seems most comfortable with this task\, poor Gina Schock is forced to dance the cool jerk AND bang the drum at the same time..and the result is pure entertainment GOLD.   Fun fact: The video version of this song is actually a 'remix' of the remixed/remade Cool Jerk ('90) that appears on the album 'Greatest'.	0

COL title VAL St. Louis Blues COL performer VAL Pearl Bailey	COL video title VAL Django Reinhardt - St.Louis Blues - 1935 September 30 - Decca\, Paris COL channel name VAL Heinz Becker COL description VAL Stéphane Grappelli and his Hot Four   Stéphane Grappelli (v); Django Reinhardt (g solo); Joseph Reinhardt\, Pierre "Baro" Ferret (g); Louis Vola (b)  1935 September 30 - Decca\, Paris   Grappelli might have been the leader on this date\, but Django is the soloist for all but the last minute of this record. For anyone of that time who was not aware of the guitarist\, the unaccompanied introduction might make them think that they were hearing a classical player. Yet\, as Django slides into a slow-walk tempo and the opening melody of "St. Louis Blues"\, there is no doubt that his heart lies in jazz. He makes effective use of bent notes in the opening chorus\, and his flashy but tasteful runs add dramatic contrast. When he goes to the tango section\, he adds to the drama with strong lines in parallel octaves. The tempo picks up as the band returns to the blues choruses\, and Reinhardt's final chorus is marked by block chords and one of his trademarked guitar rolls. When Grappelli enters\, Reinhardt steals the spotlight back with his unique accompanying style featuring choppy block chords and rolls at the turnarounds.	1

Obecnou známost a věhlas dal Jevanům právě Karel Gott\, jediná česká šoubyznysová hvězda příhraničního a světového významu. Ten si v roce 1969\, hned na kraji Jevan směrem od kutnohorské silnice\, koupil od rodiny Ročkových vilu pražského továrníka Aloise Köppela z roku 1930. V 80. letech ji ale od Karla Gotta koupil Miroslav Provod\, později známý jako kamarád Františka Mrázka a jeden ze šéfů pražského podsvětí\, který si nedávno odpykal pětiletý trest \, asi ne moc dobré spojení. Vila však po vzájemné dohodě obou mužů zůstala psaná na Gotta\, aby nemusel řadový programátor vysvětlovat\, kde vzal v 80. letech 170 tisíc západoněmeckých marek v hotovosti. V roce 1988 Gott prodal národnímu podniku Narex za zhruba 6 milionů korun\, které pak předal Provodovi\, který se vrátil z vězení a potřeboval peníze. Ale v roce 1996\, i kvůli nevyjasněným smluvním vztahům\, vilu opět od Narexu odkoupil. Ač s přestávkami vlastnil dům přes tři desítky let\, nikdy se zde natrvalo neusídlil. Dům byl sice plně vybaven\, zařízen na život jednoho i více lidí\, ale opravdovým domovem Gottovi nikdy nebyl.  V roce 2005 ji za 11 milionů prodal Janu Moťovskému\, který v ní otevřel muzeum Karla Gott Gottland - což byla skvělá myšlenka a mnoho fanoušků toto ocenilo. Muzeum\, ač na internetu stále „žijí" jeho stránky\, je bohužel už pár let zavřené. Návštěvnost po prvotním okouzlení opadla\, Jan Moťovský zmizel kdesi na Francouzské Riviéře a Gottland tímto chátrá. V současnosti má vila nového majitele\, zatím však na opravy a oživení čeká. Na rozdíl od Karla Gotta se Jevany staly skutečným domovem skladateli Karlu Svobodovi a později i kapelníkovi Ladislavu Štaidlovi. Ti dva měli dokonce své domy na břehu Jevanského rybníka hned vedle sebe. Štaidl se později přestěhoval do Prahy\, vilu obývá jeho syn. Karel Svoboda se na zápraží svého domu v roce 2007 zastřelil.  Chceme vidět Mistra! Právě Gottova vila se stala už v 70. letech 20. století důvodem\, proč Jevany získaly pověst prominentního letoviska a proč se sem od 70. let minulého století táhly zástupy výletníků\, aby zhlédli vilu (a zahlédli za záclonou) a také Mistra. Shodou okolností\, hned přes silnici naproti Gottovi měl víkendovou chatu všemocný František Hrabal\, ředitel Pragokoncertu\, organizace\, který za socialismu provozovala management většině vrcholových umělců z oblasti populární hudby.    Zřejmě se Karel a jeho věrní fanoušci už nedočkají \, obnovení vily a muzea dohromady \, byl to skvělí nápad a však zmařen \, to si Karel Gott nezaslouží \, toto opravdu ne \, dle mě je to ostuda \, budeme však doufat.	0

COL title VAL Love Is Here to Stay COL performer VAL Brian Wilson	COL video title VAL Julie London - Gone With The Wind (Liberty Records 1955) COL channel name VAL RoundMidnightTV COL description VAL "Gone with the Wind" is a popular song. The music was written by Allie Wrubel\, the lyrics by Herb Magidson. The song was published in 1937. A version recorded by Horace Heidt was a #1 song in 1937. Diane E. Holloway\, who has written extensively on American popular songs\, indicates that the title was inspired by the 1936 publication of the novel Gone with the Wind\, and the timing indicates that this is likely. But the lyrics have no connection to the subject matter of the novel\, and this song should not be confused with any of the music featured in the 1939 film adaptation.  Julie London (September 26\, 1926 – October 18\, 2000) was an American singer and actress\, whose career spanned more than 40 years. Born in Santa Rosa\, California to vaudevillian parents\, London was discovered while working as an elevator operator in downtown Los Angeles\, and began her career as an actress. London's 35-year acting career began in film in 1944\, and included roles as the female lead in numerous Westerns\, co-starring with Rock Hudson in The Fat Man (1951)\, with Robert Taylor and John Cassavetes in Saddle the Wind (1958)\, and opposite Robert Mitchum in The Wonderful Country (1959).  In the mid-1950s\, she signed a recording contract with the newly established Liberty Records\, and released a total of 32 albums of pop and jazz standards during the 1950s and 1960s\, with her signature song being "Cry Me a River"\, which she introduced in 1955. London was noted by critics for her husky\, smoky voice and languid vocal style. She released her final studio album in 1969\, but achieved continuing success playing the female starring role of Nurse Dixie McCall\, in the television series Emergency! (1972–79)\, in which she appeared opposite her real-life husband\, Bobby Troup. The show was produced by her ex-husband\, Jack Webb.  A shy and introverted woman\, London rarely granted interviews\, and spent the remainder of her life out of the public sphere. In 1995\, she suffered a stroke\, which left her with permanent health problems\, and died five years later of a heart attack.  Julie's accompanied by Ray Leatherwood (bass)\, and Barney Kessel (guitar).  Gone with the wind Gone like a leaf that has blown away Gone with the wind My romance has flown away  Yesterday's kisses are still on my lips  I had a lifetime of heaven at my fingertips   But now all is gone Gone is the rapture that thrilled my heart Gone with the wind Gone is the gladness that filled my heart  Just like a flame\, love burned brightly  Then became an empty smoke dream that has gone\,  Gone with the wind  Gone with the wind Gone with the wind Gone with the wind	0

COL title VAL Break My Mind COL performer VAL Linda Ronstadt	COL video title VAL The Tables - See Emily Play (Pink Floyd Cover) COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven COL description VAL From '' See Emily Play / Arnold Layne '' Label: Two Zero Records ‎-- TZR 002 Format: Vinyl\, 7"\, 45 RPM\, EP Country: Norway Released: 2000   Tracklist A Arnold Layne Guitar -- Reg Trademark Organ -- Mirja B See Emily Play Organ -- Reg Trademark  ------------------------  "See Emily Play" is the second single by English psychedelic rock band Pink Floyd. Written by original frontman Syd Barrett and recorded on 23 May 1967\, it featured "The Scarecrow" as its B-side. Though it was initially released as a non-album single\, the song appeared on the US edition of their debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). It later appeared on the compilations Relics (1971)\, Works (1983)\, Shine On (1992)\, Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd (2001)\, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn 40th Anniversary Edition (2007)\, and most recently on A Foot in the Door -- The Best of Pink Floyd (2011). "See Emily Play" is included in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll list and reached #6 in the UK singles chart.  Background  "See Emily Play" is also known as "Games for May"\, after a free concert in which Syd Barrett's Pink Floyd performed. The slide guitar work on the song was done by Barrett using a plastic ruler. The train depicted on the single's sleeve was drawn by him. The song only stayed in the band's setlist for a few months\, and was last played on 25 November 1967 in Blackpool. It was reportedly about a girl named Emily\, whom Barrett claimed he saw while sleeping in the woods after taking a psychedelic drug. He later stated that the story about sleeping in the woods and seeing a girl before him was made up "...all for publicity." According to A Saucerful of Secrets: The Pink Floyd Odyssey\, by Nicholas Schaffner\, Emily is the Honourable Emily Young\, daughter of Wayland Hilton Young\, 2nd Baron Kennet\, and nicknamed "the psychedelic schoolgirl" at the UFO Club. An article in Mojo magazine called "See the Real Emily" supposedly shows a picture of Barrett's Emily.  Recording and release  The details as to the recording remain shrouded in mystery due to the lack of paperwork in the EMI archive. Engineer Jeff Jarrett recalls that "See Emily Play" was recorded in a much longer form which was then edited down for the single release. It was recorded at Sound Techniques studios on 21 May 1967. There was much trickery involved in the recording with backward tapes\, much use of echo and reverb\, and the first piano bridge between the first chorus and second verse was recorded at a slow pace then sped up for the final master. The four-track master tape was wiped or misplaced. It no longer exists and has never been mixed into true stereo; it was reprocessed for fake stereo on the 1971 Relics compilation. The US single (Tower 356) was released by Tower Records three times between July 1967 and late 1968. Each time it failed to duplicate its UK success.  Television performances  Top of the Pops\, BBCTV\, July 1967  Pink Floyd performed the song three times on BBC TV's Top of the Pops. The first performance was on the 6 July 1967 edition\, hosted by Alan Freeman. They returned for the following week's edition\, 13 July\, hosted by DJ Pete Murray. The last appearance was on 27 July 1967.  Other versions  A cover of "See Emily Play" by Canadian group Three to One (aka Okee Pokey Band) is on the 1967 Yorkville album CTV After Four. This version also appears on the psychedelic compilation album Pebbles\, Volume 14.  David Bowie recorded a version of "See Emily Play" for Pin Ups in 1973.  A cover appears as (one of two) B-sides on a 1991 CD single ("I Am Here") from The Grapes of Wrath\, a Canadian jangle-pop group. The same version is available on the 1994 compilation album Seems Like Fate 1984--1992.  All About Eve played the song live c. 1992 and recorded a demo\, which was not released until 2006 as part of the Keepsakes compilation.  The song was covered by Arjen Anthony Lucassen on his 1997 album Strange Hobby and The Changelings on their 2002 album Astronomica.  Judy Dyble\, the original lead singer of Fairport Convention\, recorded a cover of "See Emily Play" in 2004.  A cover of "See Emily Play"\, appears on the 2006 bluegrass album Pickin' on Pink Floyd: A Bluegrass Tribute.  A cover appears on the 2008 album I Know You're Married But I've Got Feelings Too by Martha Wainwright.  A cover of also appears on the 2008 re-release of the album The End Is Begun by the band 3. This is a heavily modified version\, with an added bridge made by rearranging lyrics from the final verse.	0

The Creator / Macarthur Park first attempt  The first album Morgan recorded in Londons Pipe Studios (actually a TEAC 4-track recorder set up in his Notting Hill bedsit). This bizarre album was originally conceived (with the collusion of Iain McNay\, Cherry Reds boss) as a spoof compilation album featuring a variety of 'bands' from Peabody\, an obscure little town in Kansas (at that time American towns like Cleveland and Akron were viewed upon as hot-beds of modern rock music). When this concept was stated on the radio and in the press\, quite a number of people believed it! In truth\, it was all made by Morgan. The musical approach was to take songs and perform them in a way that was diametrically opposite to the original version. Here are the original artists who performed (or pre-formed) the songs\, and the styles adopted for these recordings:  1. Richard Harris in the style of The Specials or two-tone. 2. The Sex Pistols in the style of Pinky and Perky (a BBC TV childrens puppet show). 3. Kate Bush in the style of Jah Wobble and reggae/dub. 4. Perry Como in the style of The Sex Pistols and speed punk. 5. Peggy Lee - actually done in a contorted version of her own style. 6. The Brotherhood of Man in the style of Devo. 7. Rod Stewart in a new wave/techno style. 8. Sun Ra - actually an affectionate and slightly twisted version of his own style. 9. The Beatles collaged with a hint of "My Life In The Bush of Ghosts" (Eno/Byrne). 10. The Stranglers in the style of The Residents. 11. The Righteous Brothers in the style of Suicide. 12. Squeeze UK in the style of\, er\, The Residents meet Pink Floyd? Then a segue into Mott the Hoople in the style of an old 78rpm record by the Palm Court Orchestra.	0

Pubblicata nel 1938\, la canzone fu inserita nel musical di Broadway "This Way" \,in cui venne  eseguita dal cantante Tamara Drasin\, che aveva qualche anno prima cantato "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes". Il brano è uno standard jazz\, ed è statoinciso da numerosi artisti nel corso degli anni. Il tema musicale ha potere emotivo\, ed è stato molto amato durante la seconda guerra mondiale\, quando divenne un inno per coloro che prestavano servizio all'estero (dai soldati britannici e  americani). La versione più ricordata è quella di Billie Holiday (1944) e altrettanto nota è quella di Bing Crosby dello stesso anno\, dal film omonimo con  Ginger Rogers and Joseph Cotten. Mina la propone nel suo album "12 American Songbook" del 2012.

James Battle "Texas Jim" Robertson was born February 2\, 1909 near Batesville\, Texas. He recorded more than one hundred sides for RCA Victor and Bluebird during the 1940s but never released a 12" LP. When Robertson was not joined by his band\, the Panhandle Punchers\, sidemen on his recordings included Roy Wiggins\, Andy Sanella\, and Vaughn Horton on steel guitar\, some with Chet Atkins on electric guitar\, and probably Jethro Burns on mandolin. Robertson was reported dead by suicide in 1966 at age 57. One year later\, a man named Clifford Kent begins performing in Fort Worth and claims to be Texas Jim Robertson. He tells of a fire in his New York city apartment and his wish to change his identity. Clifford Kent continues to perform in Fort Worth until the early 1970s. http://www.governor.state.tx.us/music/tour/pioneers2	0

COL title VAL Squeeze Me COL performer VAL Deborah Cox	COL video title VAL Li'l Darlin' By Chuck Wayne COL channel name VAL texpaco COL description VAL Having listened to countless other versions over the past 50 years\, this to me is still the definitive rendition of this jazz classic.  Chuck Wayne was a jazz guitarist who first came to prominence in the 1940s.  He is best known for his work with Woody Herman's First Herd\, and for being the first guitarist in the George Shearing quintet.  He also played with trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie and in the '50s he recorded some albums for the Progressive label as a leader.  He released his first albums in 1953\, the best known being "The Jazz Guitarist".  He also was Tony Bennett's music director and accompanist from 1954-1957.  He had a distinctive\, swinging bebop style and developed an unusual legato technique\, not widely adopted by others until decades later.  He also had a lot of non-jazz activities which ranged from writing for Broadway to working as a staff musician for CBS-TV.  In his heyday he worked with many great vocalists including Sarah Vaughn\, Frank Sinatra\, and Barbra Streisand.   While not widely known outside the jazz circles\, he was a major influence on numerous guitarists who imitated his style.  During the 1980s he taught at the Westchester Conservatory of Music in suburban White Plains\, NY.  This Neal Hefti classic is from his album "Morning Mist" released in 1964.  "Morning Mist" was remastered and released as a CD in 2003.	0

The  closing theme to 'The Liberace Show' & his on-stage performances.   Note: There is "0"evidence of Liberace being homosexual/gay. He was once engaged to actress Joanne Rio & frequently dated countless other women; not men! He testified (under oath) & denied being homosexual (or ever taken part in homosexual practices) in a 1956 defamation trial against the Daily Mirror. He further won a libel suit (1957) against Confidential Magazine for publishing a malicious article alluding to him being a homosexual. In Liberace's biography 'The Wonderful 'Private' World of Liberace' there is no mention of him being homosexual\, engaging in homosexual practices\, or an affair with Scott Thorson??? Chapter Three does mention his affairs with women. Liberace was not gay!!!	1

COL title VAL I Love How You Love Me COL performer VAL Lynn Anderson	COL video title VAL Billie Holiday - Georgia On My Mind (OKeh Records 1941) COL channel name VAL RoundMidnightTV COL description VAL "Georgia on My Mind" is a song written in 1930 by Hoagy Carmichael (music) and Stuart Gorrell (lyrics). It is the official state song of the U.S. state of Georgia. Gorrell wrote the lyrics for Hoagy's sister\, Georgia Carmichael. However\, the lyrics of the song are ambiguous enough to refer either to the state or to a woman named "Georgia". Carmichael's 1965 autobiography\, Sometimes I Wonder\, records the origin: a friend\, saxophonist and bandleader Frankie Trumbauer\, suggested: "Why don't you write a song called 'Georgia?' Nobody lost much writing about the South." Thus\, the song is universally believed to have been written about the state. The song was first recorded on September 15\, 1930 in New York by Hoagy Carmichael and His Orchestra with Bix Beiderbecke on muted cornet and Hoagy Carmichael on vocals. The recording was part of Bix Beiderbecke's last recording session. The recording was released as Victor 23013 with "One Night in Havana".  Billie's accompanied by Shad Collins tp; Leslie Johnakins\, Eddie Barefield as; Lester Young ts; Eddie Heywood p; John Collins g; Ted Sturgis b; Kenny Clarke ds.  Recorded in New York City\, March 21\, 1941. (OKeh Records)  Georgia  Georgia   The whole day through  Just an old sweet song   Keeps Georgia on my mind  Georgia  Georgia   A song of you  Comes as sweet and clear   As moonlight through the pines       Other arms reach out to me  Other eyes smile tenderly  Still in peaceful dreams I see   The road leads back to you       Georgia  Georgia   No peace I find  Just and old sweet song   Keeps Georgia on my mind    (bridge)    Georgia  Georgia   No peace I find  Just and old sweet song   Keeps Georgia on my mind	0

COL title VAL Big Yellow Taxi COL performer VAL Big Country	COL video title VAL United We Stand - Brotherhood of Man COL channel name VAL Julie Oliverio COL description VAL Brotherhood of Man and The New Seekers are among a handful of 70s pop-folk artists who were very effective in utilizing full choral harmonies in their sound to evoke the sense of togetherness and oneness characteristic of the era.  This is United We Stand by Euro-pop group Brotherhood of Man\, who ran the top of the British pop charts several times from 1970 to 1976\, but only achieved American radio play with this LP.  Frankly\, this song just melts me.  It's corny\, it's idealistic\, it's lyrics are simple but it's melodies are gorgeous\, and the original members here (Tony Hillard\, Tony Burrows\, Sunny Leslie and Sue Glover) are earnest and true in their presentation.  Like most choral pop groups\, the band would endure an endless shuffle of members\, and by 1976 none of the original four remained\, but the innocence\, optimism and sweetness of this track always will.	0

Obecnou známost a věhlas dal Jevanům právě Karel Gott\, jediná česká šoubyznysová hvězda příhraničního a světového významu. Ten si v roce 1969\, hned na kraji Jevan směrem od kutnohorské silnice\, koupil od rodiny Ročkových vilu pražského továrníka Aloise Köppela z roku 1930. V 80. letech ji ale od Karla Gotta koupil Miroslav Provod\, později známý jako kamarád Františka Mrázka a jeden ze šéfů pražského podsvětí\, který si nedávno odpykal pětiletý trest \, asi ne moc dobré spojení. Vila však po vzájemné dohodě obou mužů zůstala psaná na Gotta\, aby nemusel řadový programátor vysvětlovat\, kde vzal v 80. letech 170 tisíc západoněmeckých marek v hotovosti. V roce 1988 Gott prodal národnímu podniku Narex za zhruba 6 milionů korun\, které pak předal Provodovi\, který se vrátil z vězení a potřeboval peníze. Ale v roce 1996\, i kvůli nevyjasněným smluvním vztahům\, vilu opět od Narexu odkoupil. Ač s přestávkami vlastnil dům přes tři desítky let\, nikdy se zde natrvalo neusídlil. Dům byl sice plně vybaven\, zařízen na život jednoho i více lidí\, ale opravdovým domovem Gottovi nikdy nebyl.  V roce 2005 ji za 11 milionů prodal Janu Moťovskému\, který v ní otevřel muzeum Karla Gott Gottland - což byla skvělá myšlenka a mnoho fanoušků toto ocenilo. Muzeum\, ač na internetu stále „žijí" jeho stránky\, je bohužel už pár let zavřené. Návštěvnost po prvotním okouzlení opadla\, Jan Moťovský zmizel kdesi na Francouzské Riviéře a Gottland tímto chátrá. V současnosti má vila nového majitele\, zatím však na opravy a oživení čeká. Na rozdíl od Karla Gotta se Jevany staly skutečným domovem skladateli Karlu Svobodovi a později i kapelníkovi Ladislavu Štaidlovi. Ti dva měli dokonce své domy na břehu Jevanského rybníka hned vedle sebe. Štaidl se později přestěhoval do Prahy\, vilu obývá jeho syn. Karel Svoboda se na zápraží svého domu v roce 2007 zastřelil.  Chceme vidět Mistra! Právě Gottova vila se stala už v 70. letech 20. století důvodem\, proč Jevany získaly pověst prominentního letoviska a proč se sem od 70. let minulého století táhly zástupy výletníků\, aby zhlédli vilu (a zahlédli za záclonou) a také Mistra. Shodou okolností\, hned přes silnici naproti Gottovi měl víkendovou chatu všemocný František Hrabal\, ředitel Pragokoncertu\, organizace\, který za socialismu provozovala management většině vrcholových umělců z oblasti populární hudby.    Zřejmě se Karel a jeho věrní fanoušci už nedočkají \, obnovení vily a muzea dohromady \, byl to skvělí nápad a však zmařen \, to si Karel Gott nezaslouží \, toto opravdu ne \, dle mě je to ostuda \, budeme však doufat.	0

He just needed the world-renowned guitarist and singer John Pizzarelli to make it.  “I got an idea got in my head\,” McCartney wrote to Pizzarelli in late May 2014.  “It might be interesting for you to do a few of my songs that are lesser known than some of the others. I realize this may be a little immodest\, if not pushy.” “I imagine the songs would include post-Beatles melodies of mine like ‘Love in the Open Air’ (from the soundtrack to 1967 film The Family Way)\, ‘Junk\,’ ‘Warm and Beautiful’ and\, possibly\, ‘My Valentine.’”  “My Valentine” was the one McCartney composition on his album of songs from the '30s and '40s\, Kisses on the Bottom (MPL/Hear Music/Concord). Pizzarelli played guitar on the album and backed Sir Paul on a handful of prestigious live performances\, including the GRAMMY Awards\, MusiCares Person of the Year gala and the initial iTunes/Apple TV live broadcast. Hailed as one of the prime contemporary interpreters of the Great American Songbook\, Pizzarelli has expanded his repertoire by performing the music of Joni Mitchell\, Neil Young\, Tom Waits\, Antônio Carlos Jobim and Lennon-McCartney.  McCartney concluded in his letter\, “The attraction for me is lesser-known tunes done in a mellow jazz style and\, if it gets some traction\, maybe the album could be titled Midnight McCartney. As I said\, this may tickle your fancy or you may decide these are the ramblings of a deranged composer with too much time on his hands.”  To say Pizzarelli was tickled is putting it mildly.	0

Black Lace represented Great Britain in 1979 in the Eurovision Song Contest and then in 1981 split up from a four-piece act into the now famous duo that we all love or hate.

COL title VAL Giant Steps COL performer VAL Tony D'Aveni	COL video title VAL Giant Steps COL channel name VAL Jazzman 2696 COL description VAL "Giant Steps" is a jazz recording by John Coltrane\, on tenor saxophone\, which is the first track on the album of the same name and is 4 minutes and 49 seconds long. The composition is a milestone for jazz musicians' progress\, given the difficulty of improvising its rapid progression of chord changes that progress through three keys (see Coltrane changes) shifted by major thirds\, creating an augmented triad.  The saxophonist had previously used this technique on the LP Blue Train on the tunes Moment's Notice and Lazy Bird. Coltrane continued in this vein on a recording with Cannonball Adderley of the standard "Limehouse Blues\," and on his original "Fifth House." He continued to use this approach on other tunes\, such as "Countdown"\, based on the Miles Davis tune "Tune Up"; "26 2" based on Charlie Parker's "Confirmation"; and a reharmonization of the jazz standard "Body and Soul." Songs such as "Naima" and "Like Sonny" also show some harmonic similarity to "Giant Steps." Coltrane continued to employ similar concepts in his soloing during his more open and modal middle period. A Love Supreme features examples of lines based on "Giant Steps" cycles over modal vamps\, to create a Polytonal effect (see modal jazz).  The progression continues to stimulate harmonic thinking in contemporary jazz. There are a number of different approaches to soloing on the song. While Coltrane favoured arpeggiation over the changes\, other players have used different tricks and patterns to bring out the sound of the changes. The chord progression was later used by Freddie Hubbard as a basis for his composition "Dear John" (on Hubbard's 1991 album Bolivia). Covers have been recorded by such artists as Rahsaan Roland Kirk\, Pat Metheny\, Buddy Rich\, Jaco Pastorius\, Mike Stern\, Greg Howe\, Tommy Flanagan (who played on the original recording)\, McCoy Tyner\, Kenny Werner\, Kenny Garrett\, Woody Herman\, and Taylor Eigsti\, Gary Bartz. The song was recorded by Chaka Khan in 1982 as part of the "Be Bop Medley" from her album "Chaka Khan".  John Coltrane was known for coming into the studio with unrehearsed songs - "Giant Steps" was no exception. On the original recording\, Tommy Flanagan (piano) played a choppy start-stop solo where it sounds like he is struggling to improvise over Coltrane changes without adequate preparation. Flanagan would revisit Giant Steps on several recordings later in his career and mastered the progression. In some of the alternate takes\, Cedar Walton is at the piano\, declining to take a solo and also playing at a slower tempo than the takes with Flanagan.	1

COL title VAL Firework COL performer VAL Mike Tompkins	COL video title VAL Marlene Dietrich ft Victor Young's Orchestra - You Go To My Head (Decca Records 1939) COL channel name VAL RoundMidnightTV COL description VAL "You Go to My Head" is a 1938 popular song composed by J. Fred Coots with lyrics by Haven Gillespie. The song is a unique conjunction of a sophisticated lyric and complex\, lush harmonic structure by two songwriters who were not generally known for such elegance; nevertheless the song is highly regarded by jazz musicians and critics alike. The song was first recorded in 1938 by Teddy Wilson with a vocal by Nan Wynn. The same year it was recorded by Billie Holiday. On 23 April 1961\, Judy Garland performed the song at the "Judy at Carnegie Hall" concert.   Marie Magdalene "Marlene" Dietrich (December 27\, 1901 – May 6\,1992) was a German-American actress and singer. Dietrich maintained popularity throughout her unusually long show business career by continually re-inventing herself\, professionally and characteristically. In 1920s Berlin\, she acted on the stage and in silent films. Her performance as Lola-Lola in The Blue Angel (1930)\, directed by Josef von Sternberg\, brought her international fame resulting in a contract with Paramount Pictures. Dietrich starred in Hollywood films such as Morocco (1930)\, Shanghai Express (1932) and Desire (1936). Dietrich successfully traded on her glamorous persona and "exotic" (to Americans) looks\, cementing her super-stardom and becoming one of the highest-paid actresses of the era. Dietrich became a U.S. citizen in 1939\, and throughout the Second World War she was a high-profile frontline entertainer. Although she still made occasional films after the end of the Second World War\, Dietrich spent most of the 1950s to the 1970s touring the world as a marquee live-show performer. Dietrich was noted for her humanitarian efforts during the War\, housing German and French exiles\, providing financial support\, and even advocating for their US citizenship. For her work improving morale on the front lines in WWII\, she received honors from the US\, France\, Belgium\, and Israel. In 1999\, the American Film Institute named Dietrich the ninth-greatest female star of classic Hollywood cinema.  You go to my head And you linger like a haunting refrain And I find you spinning round in my brain Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne  You go to my head Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew And I find the very mention of you Like the kicker in a julep or two  The thrill of the thought That you might give a thought To my plea\, casts a spell over me Still I say to myself Get a hold of yourself Can't you see that this never can be  You go to my head With a smile that makes my temperature rise Like a summer with a thousand July's You intoxicate my soul with your eyes  Though I'm certain that this heart of mine Hasn't a ghost of a chance In this crazy romance You go to my head  You go to my head With a smile that makes my temperature rise Like a summer with a thousand July's You intoxicate my soul with your eyes  Though I'm certain that this heart of mine Hasn't a ghost of a chance In this crazy romance You go to my head You go to my head	0

COL title VAL Et je t'aime tellement COL performer VAL Claude François	COL video title VAL Billie Holiday - Georgia On My Mind (OKeh Records 1941) COL channel name VAL RoundMidnightTV COL description VAL "Georgia on My Mind" is a song written in 1930 by Hoagy Carmichael (music) and Stuart Gorrell (lyrics). It is the official state song of the U.S. state of Georgia. Gorrell wrote the lyrics for Hoagy's sister\, Georgia Carmichael. However\, the lyrics of the song are ambiguous enough to refer either to the state or to a woman named "Georgia". Carmichael's 1965 autobiography\, Sometimes I Wonder\, records the origin: a friend\, saxophonist and bandleader Frankie Trumbauer\, suggested: "Why don't you write a song called 'Georgia?' Nobody lost much writing about the South." Thus\, the song is universally believed to have been written about the state. The song was first recorded on September 15\, 1930 in New York by Hoagy Carmichael and His Orchestra with Bix Beiderbecke on muted cornet and Hoagy Carmichael on vocals. The recording was part of Bix Beiderbecke's last recording session. The recording was released as Victor 23013 with "One Night in Havana".  Billie's accompanied by Shad Collins tp; Leslie Johnakins\, Eddie Barefield as; Lester Young ts; Eddie Heywood p; John Collins g; Ted Sturgis b; Kenny Clarke ds.  Recorded in New York City\, March 21\, 1941. (OKeh Records)  Georgia  Georgia   The whole day through  Just an old sweet song   Keeps Georgia on my mind  Georgia  Georgia   A song of you  Comes as sweet and clear   As moonlight through the pines       Other arms reach out to me  Other eyes smile tenderly  Still in peaceful dreams I see   The road leads back to you       Georgia  Georgia   No peace I find  Just and old sweet song   Keeps Georgia on my mind    (bridge)    Georgia  Georgia   No peace I find  Just and old sweet song   Keeps Georgia on my mind	0

Shaw\, who was born in Leicester attended the Trinity College of Music and served in the Royal Air Force in World War II leading RAF No 1 Band of the Middle East Forces. Following wartime service he arranged music for Ted Heath\, Teddy Foster\, Mantovani and many others. He became an arranger and record producer for Decca Records with his orchestra recording for that label and Phase 4 Stereo. His orchestra performed on the albums Mexico and Westward Ho. In December 1964 his orchestra released an album of cover versions of Themes from the James Bond Thrillers to coincide with the American release of Goldfinger. The popularity of Shaw's arrangements of Bond themes led to More Themes from the James Bond Thrillers for the release ofThunderball with tracks from both albums released on a UK album called James Bond in Action. In 1966 Shaw's orchestra performed Themes for Secret Agents.Themes from the James Bond Thrillers Vol.3/More James Bond in Action followed the release of Casino Royale and You Only Live Twice in 1967. Shaw came back in 1971 for The Return of James Bond/The Phase 4 World of Spy Thrillers for the release of Sean Connery's return as Bond in Diamonds Are Forever. Shaw recruited guitarist Vic Flick to repeat his guitar playing on the Gypsy Camp track. Shaw arranged music for films such as Summer Holiday (1963) and The Secret of My Success (1965) and wrote the score for Straight on Till Morning.

COL title VAL Wipe-Out COL performer VAL Sandy Nelson	COL video title VAL Rosemary Clooney & Perez Prado - You Do Something To Me (VintageMusic.es) COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Rosemary Clooney\, disfrutó durante la década de los cincuenta de una extraordinaria fama con canciones absolutamente mediocres. De la mano de Mitch Miller\, director artístico de la casa Columbia\, aplicó el inexorable principio de que\, cuantos peores eran los arreglos y las letras de los temas\, mas beneficio económico para la discográfica. onsiguió grabar un par de duets con Frank Sinatra en 1950 y a partir de ahí le sobrevino la fama y la popularidad. Tuvo su propio show televisivo e incluso Hollywood llamó a su puerta para que participara junto a Bing Crosby y Danny Kaye en algunas comedias musicales siendo la mas celebre el film de Michael Curtiz\, "White Christmas".No obstante lo dicho\, Rosemary Clooney\, se acercó tardíamente al jazz y grabó una par de magníficos álbumes para Columbia: "The Best Of Hollywood" con la orquesta del trompetista\, Harry James\, y "Blue Rose"\, su obra mas conseguida y un disco que pudo ser memorable con la orquesta de Duke Ellington. Es la tía sanguínea del actual actor George Clooney.  Dámaso Pérez Prado (Matanzas\, Cuba\, 11 de diciembre de 1916 - Ciudad de México\, 14 de septiembre de 1989)\, el "Rey del Mambo"\, fue un músico\, compositor y arreglista cubano.Dámaso Pérez Prado es mayormente conocido por sus aportes al género del mambo\, que tiene sus orígenes en el danzón cubano y daría pauta al surgimiento y desarrollo del chachachá.Pasado el clímax del mambo\, es llamativo que Dámaso Pérez Prado\, una vez compuesta su pieza musical "Patricia" y obtenido su éxito correspondiente\, la grabase muchas veces y con diferentes arreglos\, actitud que parece demostrar que tuvo por dicha pieza una especial predilección. Entre sus composiciones más conocidas se encuentran Qué rico el mambo y Mambo Nº 5\, ésta última después lanzada en una nueva versión en 1999 por el cantante alemán Lou Bega.

COL title VAL I've Got You Under My Skin COL performer VAL Stanley Black	COL video title VAL Joan Baez - And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda COL channel name VAL Spadecaller COL description VAL (See Lyrics below.) A song about a young Australian soldier maimed during the Battle of Gallipoli (1915) during the First World War; written by Eric Bogle in 1972. The paintings of Degas\, Sargent\, and the visual arts of Spadecaller\, augment the song's theme.   LYRICS:  Now when I was a young lad I carried me pack And I lived the free life of the rover. From the Murray's green banks\, to the dusty outback While I waltzed my Matilda all over. Then in 1915\, my country said\, 'Son\, It's time you stop ramblin'\, there's work to be done.' So they gave me a tin hat\, and they gave me a gun\, And they marched me away to the war.  And the band played 'Waltzing Matilda\,' As the ship pulled away from the quay\, Amidst the songs and the cheers\, the flag waving\, and tears\, We sailed off for Gallipoli.  And how well I remember that terrible day\, How our blood stained the sand we call Suvla Bay We were butchered like lambs at the slaughter.  The big Turkish shell caught me arse over head\, And when I woke up in my hospital bed And saw what it had done\, well\, I wished I was dead Never knew there was worse things than dying.  So I'll go no more 'Waltzing Matilda\,' or through the green bush bars and wide For to hunt and tent peg a man needs both legs\, No more 'Waltzing Matilda' for me.  They gathered the injured\, the wounded\, the maimed\, And they shipped us all back to Australia. The armless\, the legless\, the blind\, the insane\, Those proud wounded heroes of Suvla.  And as our ship sailed into Circular Quay\, I looked at the place where me legs used to be\, And thanked Christ there was nobody waiting for me\, To mourn\, and to grieve\, and to pity.  And the band played "Waltzing Matilda" As they wheeled us down the gangway. And nobody cheered\, they just stood and stared. And they all turned their faces away.  And the band still plays 'Waltzing Matilda\,' And the young men still answer the call\, But as year follows year\, those old men disappear Someday\, no one will march there at all.   Waltzing Mathilda\, Waltzing Mathilda Who'll come a-waltzing Mathilda with me And their ghosts may be heard as you pass the Billabong Who'll come a-waltzing Mathilda with me ?	0

COL title VAL Four Strong Winds COL performer VAL The Seekers	COL video title VAL The Kirby Stone Four (1958) - Baubles\, Bangles And Beads COL channel name VAL NBCRecords COL description VAL Born in New York City on April 27\, 1918\, Kirby (whose real name was Herbert)\, formed Herby Stone And His Pebbles shortly after the end of WWII\, which by 1947 had evolved into The Kirby Stone Quintette (later shortened to Quintet). The line-up consisted of Kirby (trumpet)\, Art Cow Eyes Engler (saxophone)\, Michael Gardner (piano)\, Bernie Doc Mandel (bass) and Gene Thaler (later replaced by Eddie Hall) (drums). Within a few short years\, the group had become a four piece featuring Kirby\, Michael\, Eddie and first rate impressionist Larry Foster. The Quintet had become a Quartet and then simply a Four\, and it was with this line-up that Kirby found his greatest success\, including a Grammy nomination in 1958 for the song Baubles\, Bangles And Beads (taken from Kismet).   Although the group re-recorded the song in 1964\, and again in 1968\, it is the 1958 version\, issued on the Columbia label\, that shows the group at its peak (and is regarded by many as the ultimate version of this Wright & Forrest classic).   As well as recording\, The Kirby Stone Four appeared on television and in nightclubs across the USA (including their own Kirby Stone Fourum club in New York City)\, and toured overseas.  In the latter half of the 1960s\, Larry left the group to once more pursue a solo career as an impressionist\, and he was replaced by Jimmy Hassell. However\, this line-up was fairly short-lived\, and by the end of the decade the Kirby Stone Four had disbanded. Kirby\, however\, continued touring and recording into the 1970s\, with Kirby Stone & The Ethnic Family and The Kirby Stone Company. He passed away on July 13\, 1981\, aged 63.  This clip features a chronological history of Kirby\, the groups he led\, and the recordings he made. Enjoy!	0

In 1945 lyrics were added by Singer-Composer- Lyricist\,  Johnny Mercer\, and was recorded in February of the same year by Woody Herman on the Columbia Records label. The film was based on a 1942 novel written by Vera Caspary\, also titled " LAURA " .

Pubblicata nel 1938\, la canzone fu inserita nel musical di Broadway "This Way" \,in cui venne  eseguita dal cantante Tamara Drasin\, che aveva qualche anno prima cantato "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes". Il brano è uno standard jazz\, ed è statoinciso da numerosi artisti nel corso degli anni. Il tema musicale ha potere emotivo\, ed è stato molto amato durante la seconda guerra mondiale\, quando divenne un inno per coloro che prestavano servizio all'estero (dai soldati britannici e  americani). La versione più ricordata è quella di Billie Holiday (1944) e altrettanto nota è quella di Bing Crosby dello stesso anno\, dal film omonimo con  Ginger Rogers and Joseph Cotten. Mina la propone nel suo album "12 American Songbook" del 2012.

COL title VAL Brazil COL performer VAL Les Paul	COL video title VAL Autumn In New York By Arthur Prysock COL channel name VAL texpaco COL description VAL This man absolutely owns this song !  Arthur Prysock was an American jazz singer best known for his live shows and his deep soulful baritone voice.  He has often been characterized as a deep-voiced Billy Eckstine\, and his singing style was very similar.  He joined bandleader Buddy Johnson as a vocalist in 1944 and became a mainstay of the live performance circuits.  He sang on several of Johnson's hits including "Jet My Love"\, "I Wonder Where Our Love Has Gone"\, and "Because".  He gained much attention for his tender\, soulful singing on a beer commercial\, "Tonight\, tonight\, let it be Löwenbräu."  He had a surprise disco hit with "When Love Is New" in 1977\, and much of his older recordings regained attention.  He received a Pioneer Award from the Rhythm and Blues Foundation in 1995.  This selection is from his album "Morning\, Noon And Night—The Collection".	0

Written by Jimmy Kennedy and Michael Carr.  SOUTH OF THE BORDER  South of the border\, down Mexico way\, That's where I fell in love When the stars above came out to play. And now as I wander\, my thoughts ever stray South of the border\, down Mexico way.  She was a picture in old Spanish lace. And for a tender while I kissed the smile upon her face. For it was fiesta\, and we were so gay South of the border\, Mexico way.  Then she sighed as she whispered 'manana' Never dreaming that we were parting.

"Sittin' on Top of the World"\, recorded by Howlin' Wolf in 1957 (and published under his birth-name Chester Burnett)\, is a well-known and widely-used version of this song. This was the version recorded by Cream in 1968. Howlin' Wolf shortened the song to just three verses. The first and third verses are similar to the second and fifth verses of the Mississippi Sheiks' song. The middle verse of Howlin' Wolf's version -- "Worked all the summer\, worked all the fall / Had to take Christmas\, in my overalls" -- was an addition to the 1930 original\, but had previously appeared in a version recorded by Ray Charles in 1949.

COL title VAL My Baby Just Cares for Me COL performer VAL Frankie Lymon	COL video title VAL Billie Holiday - Georgia On My Mind (OKeh Records 1941) COL channel name VAL RoundMidnightTV COL description VAL "Georgia on My Mind" is a song written in 1930 by Hoagy Carmichael (music) and Stuart Gorrell (lyrics). It is the official state song of the U.S. state of Georgia. Gorrell wrote the lyrics for Hoagy's sister\, Georgia Carmichael. However\, the lyrics of the song are ambiguous enough to refer either to the state or to a woman named "Georgia". Carmichael's 1965 autobiography\, Sometimes I Wonder\, records the origin: a friend\, saxophonist and bandleader Frankie Trumbauer\, suggested: "Why don't you write a song called 'Georgia?' Nobody lost much writing about the South." Thus\, the song is universally believed to have been written about the state. The song was first recorded on September 15\, 1930 in New York by Hoagy Carmichael and His Orchestra with Bix Beiderbecke on muted cornet and Hoagy Carmichael on vocals. The recording was part of Bix Beiderbecke's last recording session. The recording was released as Victor 23013 with "One Night in Havana".  Billie's accompanied by Shad Collins tp; Leslie Johnakins\, Eddie Barefield as; Lester Young ts; Eddie Heywood p; John Collins g; Ted Sturgis b; Kenny Clarke ds.  Recorded in New York City\, March 21\, 1941. (OKeh Records)  Georgia  Georgia   The whole day through  Just an old sweet song   Keeps Georgia on my mind  Georgia  Georgia   A song of you  Comes as sweet and clear   As moonlight through the pines       Other arms reach out to me  Other eyes smile tenderly  Still in peaceful dreams I see   The road leads back to you       Georgia  Georgia   No peace I find  Just and old sweet song   Keeps Georgia on my mind    (bridge)    Georgia  Georgia   No peace I find  Just and old sweet song   Keeps Georgia on my mind	0

COL title VAL Gone with the Wind COL performer VAL Peggy Lee	COL video title VAL Julie London - Gone With The Wind (Liberty Records 1955) COL channel name VAL RoundMidnightTV COL description VAL "Gone with the Wind" is a popular song. The music was written by Allie Wrubel\, the lyrics by Herb Magidson. The song was published in 1937. A version recorded by Horace Heidt was a #1 song in 1937. Diane E. Holloway\, who has written extensively on American popular songs\, indicates that the title was inspired by the 1936 publication of the novel Gone with the Wind\, and the timing indicates that this is likely. But the lyrics have no connection to the subject matter of the novel\, and this song should not be confused with any of the music featured in the 1939 film adaptation.  Julie London (September 26\, 1926 – October 18\, 2000) was an American singer and actress\, whose career spanned more than 40 years. Born in Santa Rosa\, California to vaudevillian parents\, London was discovered while working as an elevator operator in downtown Los Angeles\, and began her career as an actress. London's 35-year acting career began in film in 1944\, and included roles as the female lead in numerous Westerns\, co-starring with Rock Hudson in The Fat Man (1951)\, with Robert Taylor and John Cassavetes in Saddle the Wind (1958)\, and opposite Robert Mitchum in The Wonderful Country (1959).  In the mid-1950s\, she signed a recording contract with the newly established Liberty Records\, and released a total of 32 albums of pop and jazz standards during the 1950s and 1960s\, with her signature song being "Cry Me a River"\, which she introduced in 1955. London was noted by critics for her husky\, smoky voice and languid vocal style. She released her final studio album in 1969\, but achieved continuing success playing the female starring role of Nurse Dixie McCall\, in the television series Emergency! (1972–79)\, in which she appeared opposite her real-life husband\, Bobby Troup. The show was produced by her ex-husband\, Jack Webb.  A shy and introverted woman\, London rarely granted interviews\, and spent the remainder of her life out of the public sphere. In 1995\, she suffered a stroke\, which left her with permanent health problems\, and died five years later of a heart attack.  Julie's accompanied by Ray Leatherwood (bass)\, and Barney Kessel (guitar).  Gone with the wind Gone like a leaf that has blown away Gone with the wind My romance has flown away  Yesterday's kisses are still on my lips  I had a lifetime of heaven at my fingertips   But now all is gone Gone is the rapture that thrilled my heart Gone with the wind Gone is the gladness that filled my heart  Just like a flame\, love burned brightly  Then became an empty smoke dream that has gone\,  Gone with the wind  Gone with the wind Gone with the wind Gone with the wind	1

He probably recorded the first version in 1967\, either for the Jerden label\, or for Piccadilly\, but it was not released; then came a version on the Cotillion label in 1971; finally O'Keefe recorded his hit version for the Signpost label in 1972. In the meantime\, however\, a relatively unknown group called The Bards\, from Moses Lake\, Washington\, recorded the number and released it in January 1969 on the Jerden label (Jerden 907) and a few months later on the Parrot label (Parrot 45-337). Elvis did not sing the lines "I got my pills to ease the pain\, Can't find a thing to ease my brain." Well\, that's what you read everywhere\, but according to The Bards' guitarist\, Mardi Sheridan\, the lines were\, in fact\, "Got my pills to ease the pain\, Can't find a thing to ease the rain." The Bards own site : bardsmusic.com   I thank Mike of The Bards for allowing me to put the song on Youtube. Here are some informations he sent me :  'Bards' is an old English word meaning musician\, minstrel\, poet\, or entertainer. The story behind our use of The Bards as the name of our '60's band was wanting to emulate the Beatles (of course\, British musicians). Also\, since we were more into writing music than writing lyrics\, we decided to take some classic poetry and put it to rock music. The story of our band is memorialized here: http://bardsmusic.com'   'The picture you refer to of us was taken in 2002. (for Youtube users: it's the last picture in the video) Wow\, 10 years ago already. There was a 4th Bard\, the drummer\, who passed\, but our reunion was inspired by an interesting series of events. Just for kicks\, back around 2001 I Googled The Bards and found a number of links and information\, including a compilation CD that had one of my songs on it. Of course\, I ordered it and later got a call from a producer who specialized in releasing previously un-released music from the 60's and 70's. He somehow knew about an album of material we had that was produced by the highly successful production team of Curt Boetcher and Keith Olson. We were basically high school kids from a small eastern Washing town called Moses Lake. We went to 'Hollywood' with our 'garage band' tapes\, met Keith and Curt in an elevator and long story short\, ended up with an albums worth of music that never got released because the new label they were trying to start didn't get financing. Anyway\, 35 years later we did release it as a result of that Google search. That's what inspired the Moses Lake Recordings\, The Bards Music web site tribute (where all of this is reported) and that reunion where the picture was taken. Anyway\, I still marvel at how the internet managed to 'transcend' space and time\, bringing that music out of obscurity\, as well as rekindling the relationship of the surviving band members'.

La Foule  El éxito internacional de"Que nadie sepa mi sufrir"originalmente compuesta por el argentino Ángel Cabral en 1936\, con letra de Enrique Dizeo en ritmo de vals criollo como se le conoce en Argentina\, comenzó en 1953\, en oportunidad de la presentación en el Teatro Ópera de Buenos Aires\, de  la cantante francesa Édith Piaf\, quien escucha una grabación de Alberto Castillo. Esta inolvidable intérprete escuchó el valsecito y se lo llevó a su país. Ya en París\, convocó al autor Michel Rivgauche\, quien le cambió la letra por completo y el título\, así nació La Foule\, que en francés significa La Multitud. La transformación resultó un éxito extraordinario desde que fue publicada en 1957.  La letra original está claramente destinada a ser cantada por un hombre que ha sido abandonado por su amante\, mientras que la canción de Edith Piaf mantiene la angustia en el contexto de una chica aturdida que conoce un hombre en medio de una multitud para perderlo casi de inmediato.  www.carlostangodj.com	0

COL title VAL Sally Gooden COL performer VAL Uncle "Am" Stuart	COL video title VAL Goodbye / Charlie Haden Quartet West - 11 - Sophisticated Ladies / 2010 COL channel name VAL Vinyl Market COL description VAL Goodbye / Charlie Haden Quartet West - 11 - Sophisticated Ladies / 2010  The new release by Quartet West\, Sophisticated Ladies\, not only finds the group with a new drummer (Rodney Green)\, but as well in the company of some of the greatest female vocalists of our time - Cassandra Wilson\, Diana Krall\, Melody Gardot\, Norah Jones\, Renee Fleming and Charlie's wife\, Ruth Cameron.  Celebrating its 25th anniversary this year\, Charlie Haden's Quartet West has been championed as one of jazz's most consistently compelling bands dedicated not only to creatively revealing the secrets of the standards but as a band that is known the world over for its own sophisticated music. The quartet originally started as a side project for Haden who lives in Southern California to play with some of the great players in Los Angeles however it received such immediate acclaim that it has continued to perform and record continuously since 1986. This latest recording\, Sophisticated Ladies\, released in Europe in October 2010 to rave reviews (including a lengthy run in France as the No. 1 jazz album)\, opens the latest chapter in Quartet West's historic story with the legendary bassist at the helm. It should be noted that Charlie Haden is an omnivorous listener and collector who has gathered what he calls "a vault" of songs that he loves and that have often slipped under the radar in appreciation. Thus instead of relying on the well-treaded Great American Song library\, the bassist and bandleader brings to light lesser-known tunes delivered with refined improvisations that are equal parts romantic\, classy\, elegant and alluring.  For the wonderfully sublime Sophisticated Ladies\, Quartet West's new CD and seventh overall\, the core group of piano\, sax\, bass and drums embarks into familiar territory however with a new cast of collaborators: six of contemporary music's top-tier singers\, including\, in order of appearance\, Melody Gardot\, Norah Jones\, Cassandra Wilson\, Ruth Cameron\, Renée Fleming and Diana Krall. With his warm-toned bass lines anchoring the proceedings\, Haden leads his band comprising tenor saxophonist Ernie Watts\, pianist and orchestral strings arranger Alan Broadbent\, and drummer Rodney Green who makes his Quartet West recording debut after replacing the legendary LA based drummer\, Laurence Marable five years ago as Marable is in failing health. The 12-track album includes six salient instrumentals that complement the six moving vocal performances. With two exceptions\, the sessions were recorded live with strings in New York and Los Angeles.	0

COL title VAL I Surrender Dear COL performer VAL Julie London	COL video title VAL Maud Powell - (Coleridge-Taylor/Powell) Deep River COL channel name VAL 2ndviolinist COL description VAL Maud Powell (August 22\, 1867  January 8\, 1920) IMHO the best American violinist.  MAUD POWELL - A Pioneer's Legacy by Karen A. Shaffer (edited to fit) Maud Powell was born on August 22\, 1867\, in Peru\, Illinois\, on the western frontier in the American heartland. Her grandparents had been Methodist missionaries in Ohio\, Wisconsin\, and Illinois before the Civil War. Her father William Bramwell Powell was an innovative educator; superintendent of the public schools in Peru\, then Aurora\, IL\, and finally Washington\, D.C. Her mother Minnie Paul Powell was a pianist and composer whose gender precluded a career. Minnie and Bramwell's sisters were active in the woman's suffrage movement. Maud's uncle John Wesley Powell\, Civil War hero and explorer of the Grand Canyon\, organized the scientific study of the western lands and the native Indians as the powerful director of the U.S. Geological Survey and Bureau of Ethnology and founder of the National Geographic Society.  A prodigy\, Powell began violin and piano study in Aurora\, Illinois\, then studied violin four years with William Lewis in Chicago\, to whom she "owed the most." She completed her training with Europe's greatest masters -- Henry Schradieck in Leipzig\, Charles Dancla in Paris\, and Joseph Joachim in Berlin. Returning to the United States knowing that "girl violinists were looked upon with suspicion\," Powell boldly walked into a rehearsal of the all-male New York Philharmonic in Steinway Hall and demanded a hearing from Theodore Thomas\, then America's foremost conductor. Deeply impressed\, Thomas acknowledged his "musical grandchild" and hired her on the spot to perform the Bruch G minor violin concerto with the New York Philharmonic on November 14\, 1885. New York critic Henry E. Krehbiel acclaimed the 18-year-old's debut performance: "She is a marvellously gifted woman\, one who in every feature of her playing discloses the instincts and gifts of a born artist."  The young violinist pioneered the violin recital as she blazed new concert circuits throughout the country\, even braving the primitive touring conditions in the Far West to reach people who had never heard a concert before. She explained: "I do not play to them as an artist to the public\, but as one human being to another." Theodore Thomas chose Maud Powell to represent America's achievement in violin performance at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. During the 1893 Exposition\, Powell presented a paper to the Women's Musical Congress\, "Women and the Violin\," in which she encouraged young women to take up the violin seriously. At a time when women could not vote and were precluded from playing in professional orchestras\, she argued that there was no reason why a woman should not play the violin with the best of the men.  Powell herself had proved to the world that a woman could play the violin as well as a man\, fulfilling the shared hopes of her mother and woman suffrage leaders Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Her example inspired young girls to take up the violin and women to form music clubs and orchestras throughout the land.  Powell became one of America's most revered and beloved musicians while her 1907 recording of Drdla's Souvenir became the most popular violin record of its day.  Maud Powell toured Europe\, North America and South Africa to wide acclaim\, appearing with the great orchestras of her time under such conductors as Mahler\, Nikisch\, Thomas\, Safonov\, Damrosch\, Seidl\, Richter\, Wood\, Herbert and Stokowski.  Perhaps Powell's greatest artistic triumph was her American premiere (November 30\, 1906) of the Sibelius Violin Concerto\, which she glowingly described as "a gigantic rugged thing\, an epic really....It is on new lines and has a new technique. O\, it is wonderful." Powell introduced fourteen violin concertos to the American public -- by Tchaikovsky\, Dvořák\, Saint-Saëns\, Lalo\, Sibelius\, Coleridge-Taylor\, Arensky\, Aulin\, Huss\, Shelley\, Conus\, Bruch and Rimsky-Korsakov. She also revived neglected works of the 18th century\, including Mozart's Sinfonia Concertante for violin and viola\, and even edited a Locatelli violin sonata for publication. She boldly championed works by American composers. Maud Powell died the year the 19th Amendment granting national suffrage to women was ratified. Upon her death on January 8\, 1920\, the New York Symphony paid tribute to this "supreme and unforgettable artist": "She was not only America's great master of the violin\, but a woman of lofty purpose and noble achievement\, whose life and art brought to countless thousands inspiration for the good and the beautiful." © Karen A. Shaffer Karen A. Shaffer\, Maud Powell's biographer and president of The Maud Powell Society for Music and Education based in Arlington\, Virginia. E-mail: kshaffer@erols.com	0

COL title VAL You Do Something to Me COL performer VAL Dean Elliott and His Orchestra	COL video title VAL Rosemary Clooney & Perez Prado - You Do Something To Me (VintageMusic.es) COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Rosemary Clooney\, disfrutó durante la década de los cincuenta de una extraordinaria fama con canciones absolutamente mediocres. De la mano de Mitch Miller\, director artístico de la casa Columbia\, aplicó el inexorable principio de que\, cuantos peores eran los arreglos y las letras de los temas\, mas beneficio económico para la discográfica. onsiguió grabar un par de duets con Frank Sinatra en 1950 y a partir de ahí le sobrevino la fama y la popularidad. Tuvo su propio show televisivo e incluso Hollywood llamó a su puerta para que participara junto a Bing Crosby y Danny Kaye en algunas comedias musicales siendo la mas celebre el film de Michael Curtiz\, "White Christmas".No obstante lo dicho\, Rosemary Clooney\, se acercó tardíamente al jazz y grabó una par de magníficos álbumes para Columbia: "The Best Of Hollywood" con la orquesta del trompetista\, Harry James\, y "Blue Rose"\, su obra mas conseguida y un disco que pudo ser memorable con la orquesta de Duke Ellington. Es la tía sanguínea del actual actor George Clooney.  Dámaso Pérez Prado (Matanzas\, Cuba\, 11 de diciembre de 1916 - Ciudad de México\, 14 de septiembre de 1989)\, el "Rey del Mambo"\, fue un músico\, compositor y arreglista cubano.Dámaso Pérez Prado es mayormente conocido por sus aportes al género del mambo\, que tiene sus orígenes en el danzón cubano y daría pauta al surgimiento y desarrollo del chachachá.Pasado el clímax del mambo\, es llamativo que Dámaso Pérez Prado\, una vez compuesta su pieza musical "Patricia" y obtenido su éxito correspondiente\, la grabase muchas veces y con diferentes arreglos\, actitud que parece demostrar que tuvo por dicha pieza una especial predilección. Entre sus composiciones más conocidas se encuentran Qué rico el mambo y Mambo Nº 5\, ésta última después lanzada en una nueva versión en 1999 por el cantante alemán Lou Bega.

COL title VAL That Old Feeling COL performer VAL Ray Conniff and His Orchestra	COL video title VAL Joan Baez - And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda COL channel name VAL Spadecaller COL description VAL (See Lyrics below.) A song about a young Australian soldier maimed during the Battle of Gallipoli (1915) during the First World War; written by Eric Bogle in 1972. The paintings of Degas\, Sargent\, and the visual arts of Spadecaller\, augment the song's theme.   LYRICS:  Now when I was a young lad I carried me pack And I lived the free life of the rover. From the Murray's green banks\, to the dusty outback While I waltzed my Matilda all over. Then in 1915\, my country said\, 'Son\, It's time you stop ramblin'\, there's work to be done.' So they gave me a tin hat\, and they gave me a gun\, And they marched me away to the war.  And the band played 'Waltzing Matilda\,' As the ship pulled away from the quay\, Amidst the songs and the cheers\, the flag waving\, and tears\, We sailed off for Gallipoli.  And how well I remember that terrible day\, How our blood stained the sand we call Suvla Bay We were butchered like lambs at the slaughter.  The big Turkish shell caught me arse over head\, And when I woke up in my hospital bed And saw what it had done\, well\, I wished I was dead Never knew there was worse things than dying.  So I'll go no more 'Waltzing Matilda\,' or through the green bush bars and wide For to hunt and tent peg a man needs both legs\, No more 'Waltzing Matilda' for me.  They gathered the injured\, the wounded\, the maimed\, And they shipped us all back to Australia. The armless\, the legless\, the blind\, the insane\, Those proud wounded heroes of Suvla.  And as our ship sailed into Circular Quay\, I looked at the place where me legs used to be\, And thanked Christ there was nobody waiting for me\, To mourn\, and to grieve\, and to pity.  And the band played "Waltzing Matilda" As they wheeled us down the gangway. And nobody cheered\, they just stood and stared. And they all turned their faces away.  And the band still plays 'Waltzing Matilda\,' And the young men still answer the call\, But as year follows year\, those old men disappear Someday\, no one will march there at all.   Waltzing Mathilda\, Waltzing Mathilda Who'll come a-waltzing Mathilda with me And their ghosts may be heard as you pass the Billabong Who'll come a-waltzing Mathilda with me ?	0

"The Hucklebuck" was a Big Band and Jump Jive standard from the 40's. Everybody had a variation of it in their repertoire. The reason was that 'hucklebuck' was a euphemism for something the latter part of it rhymed with. When couples trysted to it on the dancefloor\, band leaders knew how to swing that sexual energy. It survived into Rock'n'Roll through versions like Chubby Checker's\, which may be where the Birdies learned to shake a tailfeather.   The "Girls In the Garage" CD I culled it from was no help for any info about them. (Where are Alec Palao or Lois Wilson when you need them? Hopefully making the all-girls NUGGETS box set of my dreams!) But a fan informed me they were another guise of Darlene Love & the Blossoms! Ms. Love is legendary for her chameleonic turns behind the mike under different names: The Crystals ("He's a Rebel"); Bobb B. Soxx & the Blue Jeans; and the K-C-Ettes\, behind guitarist Al Casey ("Surfin' Hootenanny"). Darlene had a funny story of evading producer Phil Spector when he was mad at her for working other studios under aliases\, but now that story sounds really ominous. Darlene is also famous for portraying Danny Glover's wife in the 'Lethal Weapon' movies\, and is just as potent a performer today.    To have a Movement\, ya gotta move first. Rock propelled the hips before it prodded people to be hip in awareness. As Feminism would soon declare\, "the personal is political".  Just the act of freeing your body\, your inhibitions\, your appearance\, your choice of partner\, or your choice of music was tantamount to a political action. In a turbulent time when the youth were starting to question everything about any arbitrary boundaries\, every move they made away from these was rebellion. No neat little boxes for them. More like a spectrum of rooms to explore and exceed. In this moment\, the air is electric with the tension of possibility...

It was written by Otis Blackwell and Jack Hammer. The Jerry Lee Lewis 1957 recording was ranked as the 96th greatest song ever by Rolling Stone. The song is in AABA form.  Jerry Lee Lewis recording  The song is best known for Jerry Lee Lewis's original recording\, which was recorded in the Sun Studio in Memphis\, Tennessee\, on October 8\, 1957\, and released as a 45rpm single on Sun 281 in November 1957. It reached #2 on the Billboard pop charts\, #3 on the R&B charts\, and #1 on the country charts. It also reached #1 on the UK pop charts\, appeared on the New Zealand Singles Chart\, and the Dutch Top 40.  The song was featured in a performance by Jerry Lee Lewis and his band in the 1957 Warner Brothers rock and roll film Jamboree\, which also featured Carl Perkins\, Fats Domino\, Buddy Knox\, and Dick Clark. The recording was also released in the UK on London Records.  The song title is derived from a Southern expression\, which some Christians consider blasphemous\, that refers to the Pentecost's defining moment when the Holy Spirit manifested itself as "cloven tongues as of fire" and the Apostles spoke in tongues.  Legacy  Monty Python references the song's title in the "World Forum" sketch\, a fake game show\, as heard on the live album Monty Python Live at City Center. Terry Gilliam\, portraying Mao Zedong\, says the song title as the only correct answer the "distinguished panel" offers in the early rounds. The song was used for the New York City audience in place of "Sing\, Little Birdie\," which was the song title used in the original sketch.  Levi Kreis\, portraying Jerry Lee Lewis\, sang "Great Balls of Fire" in the Broadway musical "Million Dollar Quartet\," which opened in New York in April\, 2010; and Kreis covered the song on the "Million Dollar Quartet" original Broadway cast recording (copyright 2010 by MDQ Merchandising\, LLC). Levi Kreis won a 2010 Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical for his portrayal of Jerry Lee Lewis in "Million Dollar Quartet."  Other recordings  The Crickets released their version of the song in 1960 on their album\, "In Style With The Crickets." Gary Lewis and the Playboys released a cover of this song in 1970 as the B-Side to the song "I'm On The Right Road Now."

COL title VAL Don't Speak COL performer VAL Yendry	COL video title VAL Kirk Whalum - Someday We'll All Be Free COL channel name VAL RobertoCastillo2184 COL description VAL Everything Is Everything: A Tribute To Donny Hathaway is Kirk Whalum's second album in 2010. In March\, he released The Gospel According to Jazz: Chapter III\, his first recording in two years\, with a star-studded lineup.  Everything Is Everything features 11 tunes closely associated with the late singer\, songwriter and pianist. Hathaway recorded 10 of them himself; the other he wrote for Blood Stone. Whalum is joined by a stellar cast who include John Stoddart on Fender Rhodes\, Shedrick Mitchell on organ\, guitarists Jef Lee Johnson and Larry Campbell\, bassist Christian McBride\, percussionist Bashiri Johnson\, and drummer John Roberts. (Guest appearances by Rick Braun\, Jeff Golub\, and Robert Randolph round it out.) This is a primarily instrumental set\, recorded in a polished but old-school\, 1970s Funky Soul Jazz style — nearly CTI in production approach with some fine vocal performances sweetening the deal. Musiq Soulchild lends his mellifluous tenor to the slow-burning "We're Still Freinds\," and Hathaway's daughter Lalah graces the silky babymaker "You Had to Know."  Whalum evokes his best Grover Washington\, Jr. on the kick-off track "Giving Up\," and the lyric influence of fellow Memphian David Fathead Newman is heard on "Someday We'll All Be Free\," featuring a lovely\, tastefully articulated string arrangement by Gil Goldstein. The recording of Leon Russell's "Song for You" is a real highlight here\, as Whalum references Hathaway's vocal phrasing on his tenor. Goldstein's strings are up in the mix but aren't intrusive. "Valdez in the Country" digs deeper into Hathaway's original to bring the Latin polyrhythms to the fore\, and Golub's guitar solo is a monster — adding grit to the interplay between the rhythm section and percussionists. "Je Vous Aime (I Love You)\," one of two cuts here written by Hathaway with Leroy Hutson\, features a female gospel chorus.  Randolph's pedal steel on "Tryin' Times" adds some nasty to this funky number. "Voices Inside (Everything Is Everything)" closes it with Stoddart taking an incidental lead vocal backed by a chorus\, as Braun and Randolph round out the core band. Andy Snitzer's programming (this is the only cut it appears on) is minimal; making it suitable for the dancefloor and remixing. McBride's electric bass is the driving force\, and the chorus is chilling in its emotional reach. Whether intended or not\, Whalum's range of musical creativity on Everything Is Everything: A Tribute to Donny Hathaway\, while keeping it grounded in the singer's ouevre\, makes this the album by which the saxophonist will be judged from here on out.

COL title VAL Let It Be Me COL performer VAL Anne Murray & Vince Gill	COL video title VAL The Sweet Inspirations - Let It Be Me COL channel name VAL Kerith Louisa Williams-Catton COL description VAL Info: The Sweet Inspirations were an American R&B girl group mostly known for their work as backup singers on studio recordings for other R&B and rock artists. A founding member of the group was Dionne Warwick\, who was later replaced by her aunt\, Cissy Houston. The Sweet Inspirations was founded by former members of The Drinkard Singers\, a long-running Gospel singing group whose membership included Cissy Houston (née Drinkard\, and mother of Whitney Houston\, 1963) and Lee Warwick\, who was Cissy's sister and the mother of Sweet Inspirations members Dee Dee and Dionne Warwick). As a backup group\, the Sweet Inspirations were in high demand among producers\, publishers\, artists\, and songwriters in the early 1960s. The original lineup included Doris Troy and the two Warwick sisters Dionne & Dee Dee. Sylvia Shemwell (sister of Judy Clay) replaced Troy\, while Cissy Houston took over from Dionne\, with Dee Dee Warwick as the group's official leader. The group sang backup for many stars\, including Solomon Burke\, Aretha Franklin\, Wilson Pickett\, and Esther Phillips. Dee Dee left in 1965\, when her solo career began to take off. She was replaced by Myrna Smith. Estelle Brown joined the team soon after\, and the line-up that was to become an Atlantic recording group was set. The Sweet Inspirations recorded by themselves for the first time in April 1967 for Atlantic Records. That session produced the first two singles released by Atlantic\, a version of "Why (Am I Treated So Bad)\," a song previously recorded by The Staple Singers and a soulful version of "Let It Be Me"\, a French song which had been a pop and R&B hit for Betty Everett & Jerry Butler in 1964.	1

It was written by Otis Blackwell and Jack Hammer. The Jerry Lee Lewis 1957 recording was ranked as the 96th greatest song ever by Rolling Stone. The song is in AABA form.  Jerry Lee Lewis recording  The song is best known for Jerry Lee Lewis's original recording\, which was recorded in the Sun Studio in Memphis\, Tennessee\, on October 8\, 1957\, and released as a 45rpm single on Sun 281 in November 1957. It reached #2 on the Billboard pop charts\, #3 on the R&B charts\, and #1 on the country charts. It also reached #1 on the UK pop charts\, appeared on the New Zealand Singles Chart\, and the Dutch Top 40.  The song was featured in a performance by Jerry Lee Lewis and his band in the 1957 Warner Brothers rock and roll film Jamboree\, which also featured Carl Perkins\, Fats Domino\, Buddy Knox\, and Dick Clark. The recording was also released in the UK on London Records.  The song title is derived from a Southern expression\, which some Christians consider blasphemous\, that refers to the Pentecost's defining moment when the Holy Spirit manifested itself as "cloven tongues as of fire" and the Apostles spoke in tongues.  Legacy  Monty Python references the song's title in the "World Forum" sketch\, a fake game show\, as heard on the live album Monty Python Live at City Center. Terry Gilliam\, portraying Mao Zedong\, says the song title as the only correct answer the "distinguished panel" offers in the early rounds. The song was used for the New York City audience in place of "Sing\, Little Birdie\," which was the song title used in the original sketch.  Levi Kreis\, portraying Jerry Lee Lewis\, sang "Great Balls of Fire" in the Broadway musical "Million Dollar Quartet\," which opened in New York in April\, 2010; and Kreis covered the song on the "Million Dollar Quartet" original Broadway cast recording (copyright 2010 by MDQ Merchandising\, LLC). Levi Kreis won a 2010 Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical for his portrayal of Jerry Lee Lewis in "Million Dollar Quartet."

The  closing theme to 'The Liberace Show' & his on-stage performances.   Note: There is "0"evidence of Liberace being homosexual/gay. He was once engaged to actress Joanne Rio & frequently dated countless other women; not men! He testified (under oath) & denied being homosexual (or ever taken part in homosexual practices) in a 1956 defamation trial against the Daily Mirror. He further won a libel suit (1957) against Confidential Magazine for publishing a malicious article alluding to him being a homosexual. In Liberace's biography 'The Wonderful 'Private' World of Liberace' there is no mention of him being homosexual\, engaging in homosexual practices\, or an affair with Scott Thorson??? Chapter Three does mention his affairs with women. Liberace was not gay!!!	0

He probably recorded the first version in 1967\, either for the Jerden label\, or for Piccadilly\, but it was not released; then came a version on the Cotillion label in 1971; finally O'Keefe recorded his hit version for the Signpost label in 1972. In the meantime\, however\, a relatively unknown group called The Bards\, from Moses Lake\, Washington\, recorded the number and released it in January 1969 on the Jerden label (Jerden 907) and a few months later on the Parrot label (Parrot 45-337). Elvis did not sing the lines "I got my pills to ease the pain\, Can't find a thing to ease my brain." Well\, that's what you read everywhere\, but according to The Bards' guitarist\, Mardi Sheridan\, the lines were\, in fact\, "Got my pills to ease the pain\, Can't find a thing to ease the rain." The Bards own site : bardsmusic.com   I thank Mike of The Bards for allowing me to put the song on Youtube. Here are some informations he sent me :  'Bards' is an old English word meaning musician\, minstrel\, poet\, or entertainer. The story behind our use of The Bards as the name of our '60's band was wanting to emulate the Beatles (of course\, British musicians). Also\, since we were more into writing music than writing lyrics\, we decided to take some classic poetry and put it to rock music. The story of our band is memorialized here: http://bardsmusic.com'   'The picture you refer to of us was taken in 2002. (for Youtube users: it's the last picture in the video) Wow\, 10 years ago already. There was a 4th Bard\, the drummer\, who passed\, but our reunion was inspired by an interesting series of events. Just for kicks\, back around 2001 I Googled The Bards and found a number of links and information\, including a compilation CD that had one of my songs on it. Of course\, I ordered it and later got a call from a producer who specialized in releasing previously un-released music from the 60's and 70's. He somehow knew about an album of material we had that was produced by the highly successful production team of Curt Boetcher and Keith Olson. We were basically high school kids from a small eastern Washing town called Moses Lake. We went to 'Hollywood' with our 'garage band' tapes\, met Keith and Curt in an elevator and long story short\, ended up with an albums worth of music that never got released because the new label they were trying to start didn't get financing. Anyway\, 35 years later we did release it as a result of that Google search. That's what inspired the Moses Lake Recordings\, The Bards Music web site tribute (where all of this is reported) and that reunion where the picture was taken. Anyway\, I still marvel at how the internet managed to 'transcend' space and time\, bringing that music out of obscurity\, as well as rekindling the relationship of the surviving band members'.

COL title VAL La paloma COL performer VAL Ingmar Nordströms	COL video title VAL Donna Loren "I'll Be Your Baby Tonight" (2010 Album Video) COL channel name VAL Donna Loren Now COL description VAL Please subscribe to the Donna Loren Channel above!   More info: http://www.DonnaLoren.com or purchase this song on ITunes.   This is a track from Donna Loren's newest album entitled "Love It Away"\, released in Spring\, 2010. A 53-minute video documentation of the entire album was produced and filmed in Los Angeles and this is one of the selections from that video. This will explain the continuity in wardrobe and staging in this series of videos from the "Love It Away" album on YouTube. The song was written by Bob Dylan from his "John Wesley Harding" album.  Donna Loren was the one-and-only "Dr Pepper Girl" from 1963 to 1968. She was signed to a long-term contract with the soft-drink company to sing all television and radio commercials\, do all magazine and billboard advertising representing them in every capacity\, sometimes sharing the spotlight with American Bandstand's Dick Clark. This relationship led to her touring in Dick Clark's Caravan of Stars with other popular acts like Diana Ross and The Supremes and singing solos in the popular Beach Party films starring Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon. Later\, she became the regular female vocalist on the popular 60's American live rock n roll TV show "Shindig" and she appeared in singing and acting roles in many iconic TV shows like Batman\, The Monkees\, Gomer Pyle\, The Mothers-In-Law\, Red Skelton\, Milton Berle and various game shows. In the 60's she released 18 singles and an LP. Her newest CD entitled "Love It Away"\, released January 1st\, 2010\, is her first new music in decades. Hear it at http://www.DonnaLoren.com.	0

Well\, if you're a Roy Drusky fan\, probably so. If you asked me if the album works as a whole\, I'd say no. Roy's still at the top of his game in the later stages of his career\, but most of these pop tunes just don't translate well to a country setting (like The Beatles' "Yesterday"\, which DOES NOT work as a country tune so stop trying\, dammit!). This cover of the #4 1964 Gerry And The Pacemakers hit isn't too bad\, so it's worth a listen.	0

In December 1964 his orchestra released an album of cover versions of Themes from the James Bond Thrillers to coincide with the American release of Goldfinger. The popularity of Shaw's arrangements of Bond themes led to More Themes from the James Bond Thrillers for the release ofThunderball with tracks from both albums released on a UK album called James Bond in Action. In 1966 Shaw's orchestra performed Themes for Secret Agents.Themes from the James Bond Thrillers Vol.3/More James Bond in Action followed the release of Casino Royale and You Only Live Twice in 1967.

COL title VAL When I'm Sixty-Four COL performer VAL Branimir Krstic	COL video title VAL Lorez Alexandria -- I'm Glad There Is You (1957) COL channel name VAL JazzyRNA COL description VAL Continuing with saga of America's most gifted\, and underrated jazz vocalists—this particular artist takes the cake—not meaning the particular term in a negative connotation\, but it's such a pity that a remarkable songstress—the incomparable\, Lorez Alexandria is not afforded the recognition that she so deserves. This is proven true\, given the fact that I recently discovered her albums—and I just haven't had my fill. I've searched and purchased everything I could find from such a gifted songstress. Lorez crafts each lyric with such grace and tonality that could easily match (if not surpass) the reigning jazz stylists of the bop/jazz/pop age. She gives each standard a new sense of evocative meaning as far as lyrics are concerned\, and reinvents the wheel each time she unleashes her enthralling voice. As she once said "A lyric is dead\, until you breathe life into it." This is exactly what she does. Enjoy and listen in HD\, to the lovely—Lorez Alexandria. All right(s) to 1957 King Records\, Inc	0

Anyway\, Memphis in June reminds me of that\, too\, despite what an obviously lazy summer song it is\, so here it is. I could only find a video with some dude playing it on guitar\, and he was badass\, but I really dig Hoagy Carmichael's voice and style. Check out "Two Sleepy People." Someone uploaded it to Youtube with a bunch of pictures of little dogs\, haha. Hoagy Carmichael is great in it\, but Ella Logan steals the show.	0

More info: http://www.DonnaLoren.com or purchase this song on ITunes.   This is a track from Donna Loren's newest album entitled "Love It Away"\, released in Spring\, 2010. A 53-minute video documentation of the entire album was produced and filmed in Los Angeles and this is one of the selections from that video.

She was signed to a long-term contract with the soft-drink company to sing all television and radio commercials\, do all magazine and billboard advertising representing them in every capacity\, sometimes sharing the spotlight with American Bandstand's Dick Clark. This relationship led to her touring in Dick Clark's Caravan of Stars with other popular acts like Diana Ross and The Supremes and singing solos in the popular Beach Party films starring Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon. Later\, she became the regular female vocalist on the popular 60's American live rock n roll TV show "Shindig" and she appeared in singing and acting roles in many iconic TV shows like Batman\, The Monkees\, Gomer Pyle\, The Mothers-In-Law\, Red Skelton\, Milton Berle and various game shows. In the 60's she released 18 singles and an LP. Her newest CD entitled "Love It Away"\, released January 1st\, 2010\, is her first new music in decades. Hear it at http://www.DonnaLoren.com.	0

Fraguada en las big bands de los años treinta\, Dinah se convirtió en los cuarenta en una de las artistas más populares de los Estados Unidos gracias a su interpretación de numerosos éxitos musicales\, como "Buttons and Bows"\, "The Gypsy" y "I´ll Walk Alone"\, y en años sucesivos gracias a su aparición en varios programas televisivos. Nacida en el rural del estado de Tennessee\, Dinah Shore trabajó en la radio de Nashville ya cuando era adolescente. Su carrera profesional se inició más tarde en Nueva York donde cantó con Xavier Cugat. Tras fallidas audiciones para trabajar con Benny Goodman y Tommy Dorsey\, se decidió por convertirse en una cantante individual. Firmó con Bluebird en 1940-1941\, grabó varios éxitos\, entre los que figuran "Yes\, My Darling Daughter"\, "I Hear a Rhapsody" y "Jim". En 1942 vendió un millón de ejemplares del tema "Blues in the Night". Firmó luego con la compañía RCA Victor y obtuvo un nuevo gran éxito con "You´d Be So Nice to Come Home To" y\, sobre todo\, en 1944 con "I´ll Walk Alone". Trabajó también en algunas películas\, como por ejemplo en 1944 en Up in Arms y en 1946 en Till the Clouds Roll By. Entre 1946 y 1949 destacan temas como "The Gypsy"\, "I Love You for Sentimental Reasons"\, "Anniversary Song"\, "I Wish I Didn´t Love You So"\, "Buttons and Bows" y "Dear Hearts and Gentle People". En los cincuenta fue famosa más que por su música por su espectáculo televisivo de variedades The Dinah Shore Chevy Show\, medio en el que trabajaría de forma irregular hasta los años ochenta. Murió de un cáncer.   iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/es/album/a-wonderful-guy/id879697670 Spotify: http://open.spotify.com/album/5mkWSBfR3EWhh6EKdGEGpo Síguenos en: Spotify: https://goo.gl/raouHQ Facebook: https://goo.gl/L92BHL Instagram: https://goo.gl/3oYDGH Web: http://www.vintagemusic.es   Compra nuestros Cd's en formato físico en estas plataformas: Ebay:  http://stores.ebay.com/VintageMusicFm BoutiqAlia: www.boutiqalia-vintagemusic.com Discogs: https://www.discogs.com/es/seller/vintagemusicfm/profile	0

Pubblicata nel 1938\, la canzone fu inserita nel musical di Broadway "This Way" \,in cui venne  eseguita dal cantante Tamara Drasin\, che aveva qualche anno prima cantato "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes". Il brano è uno standard jazz\, ed è statoinciso da numerosi artisti nel corso degli anni. Il tema musicale ha potere emotivo\, ed è stato molto amato durante la seconda guerra mondiale\, quando divenne un inno per coloro che prestavano servizio all'estero (dai soldati britannici e  americani). La versione più ricordata è quella di Billie Holiday (1944) e altrettanto nota è quella di Bing Crosby dello stesso anno\, dal film omonimo con  Ginger Rogers and Joseph Cotten. Mina la propone nel suo album "12 American Songbook" del 2012.

COL title VAL Candy Kisses COL performer VAL Eddie Kirk	COL video title VAL "What The World Needs Now Is Love" (1968) The Staple Singers COL channel name VAL Gospel Nostalgia COL description VAL This is track 1 from the 1968 album "What The World Needs Now Is Love". Lead by Mavis Staples Written by Hal David and Burt Bacharach The family began appearing in Chicago-area churches in 1948\, and signed their first professional contract in 1952. During their early career they recorded in an acoustic gospel-folk style with various labels: United Records\, Vee-Jay Records(their "Uncloudy Day" and "Will The Circle Be Unbroken" were best sellers)\, Checker Records\, Riverside Records\, and then Epic Records in 1965. While the family surname is "Staples"\, the group used the singular form for its name\, resulting in the group's name being "The Staple Singers".  It was on Epic that the Staple Singers began moving into mainstream pop markets\, with "Why (Am I Treated So Bad)" and "For What It's Worth" (Stephen Stills) in 1967. In 1968\, the Staple Singers signed to Stax Records and released two albums with Steve Cropper and Booker T & the MG's — Soul Folk in Action and We'll Get Over. By 1970\, Al Bell had become producer\, and with Engineer Terry Manning\, the family began recording at the famed Muscle Shoals Sound Studio\, and Memphis' Ardent Studios\, moving in a more funk and soul direction.  The first Stax hit was "Heavy Makes You Happy (Sha-Na-Boom Boom)". Their 1971 recording of "Respect Yourself"\, written by Luther Ingram and Mack Rice\, peaked at #2 on the R&B charts and was a #12 pop hit as well. The song's theme of self-empowerment had universal appeal\, released in the period immediately following the intense American civil rights movement of the 1960s. In 1972\, the group had a huge #1 hit in the United States with "I'll Take You There". It topped both pop and R&B charts. "If You're Ready (Come Go With Me)" would become another big hit\, reaching #9 pop and #1 on the R&B chart in 1973. Then\, after Stax's bankruptcy in 1975\, they signed to Curtis Mayfield's label\, Curtom Records\, and released "Let's Do It Again"\, produced by Mayfield; the song became their second #1 pop hit in the US and the album also. In 1976\, they collaborated with The Band for their film The Last Waltz\, performing on the song "The Weight" (which The Staple Singers had previously covered on their first Stax album). However\, they were not able to regain their momentum\, releasing only occasional minor hits. Their 1984 album Turning Point featured their final Top 40 hit\, a cover of Talking Heads' "Slippery People" (which also reached the Top 5 on the Dance chart). In 1994\, they again performed the song "The Weight" with Country music artist Marty Stuart for MCA Nashville's Rhythm\, Country and Blues compilation\, somewhat re-establishing an audience. The song "Respect Yourself" was used by Spike Lee in the soundtrack to his movie Crooklyn\, made in 1994.  In 1999\, the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Pops Staples died of complications from a concussion suffered in December 2000. In 2005\, the group was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Mavis Staples has continued to carry on the family tradition and continues to add her vocal talents to both the projects of other artists and her own solo ventures. Cleotha Staples died in Chicago on February 21\, 2013\, after suffering from Alzheimer's disease for over a decade.	0

A vocal version was also released and performed by Melina Mercouri in the film of same name directed by Jules Dassin and starring Mercouri. Written by Hadjidakis\, the song won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1960\, a first for a foreign-language picture. The film score to the movie was first released on October 1\, 1960 by United Artists Records. The song has since been covered by numerous artists\, and has gained various degrees of success throughout the world.  Background  The original Greek version featured lyrics also written by Hadjidakis was performed in the film by Melina Mercouri. The original Greek lyrics (along with the foreign translations in German\, French and Italian) tell the story of the main female character of the film\, Illya (Mercouri). Illya is a jolly woman who enjoys life\, the town and the people of her native Piraeus. Although she earns her money as a prostitute\, she longs to meet a man someday who is just as full of joie de vivre as she is herself.  In 1960\, the song was nominated and won the Academy Award for Best Original Song\, a first for a foreign-language picture since the Academy began to recognize achievements in this category in 1934. An orchestral version recorded by Don Costa reached number 19 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1960\, while it also remained on the chart into 1961. Following the success of the orchestral version as well as the Oscar win\, an English language version of the song was commissioned to be written especially to match the title of the film. The lyrics to the English version of the song were written by Billy Towne. A vocal cover of the song by The Chordettes reached number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1961.  Lale Andersen scored a number one hit in 1960 with the German language version of the song titled "Ein Schiff wird kommen".  In 2010\, a remixed dance version of the song was released by newly formed group Aroma (consisting of Raf Marchesini\, Max B and Ilario Drago) under the title "The Children of Piraeus". English\, Greek\, and French versions of the song were released\, with the English and Greek versions feature vocals by Fame Story 3 contestant Katerina Bourneli\, while the French version features vocals by In-Grid. The song was co-produced by Ego Music Italy and Planetworks Records Greece.  Covers  The song has been covered in a number of languages since its release:  Greek (as Τα Παιδιά του Πειραιά) by Melina Mercouri\, Nana Mouskouri\, Andy Williams\, and Pink Martini. English (as Never on Sunday) by Bing Crosby\, Done Costa\, Lena Horne\, Doris Day\, Andy Williams\, Connie Francis\, Petula Clark\, Lale Andersen\, and The Chordettes.

Cantonese (as 兩爺仔) by Andy Lau\, Anita Mui and Sandra Ng in the film Dance of Dream (愛君如夢). The title song roughly translates "Father and son". Mandarin (as 別在星期天) by Teresa Teng.

Other appearances  The song was used again in the 2005 movie Munich. James Hill\, a Canadian ukulele player\, recorded a version of the song on ukulele for his album A Flying Leap. Nia Vardalos sang a snippet of the Greek version in her 2009 film My Life in Ruins. Los Umbrellos\, a Danish musical group\, used it as a base for their 1998 signature song\, "No Tengo Dinero". This song was sung on the Muppet Show by Miss Piggy and Greek pigs\, complete with smashing plates.	0

COL title VAL I Can't Give You Anything but Love COL performer VAL Ukulele Ike	COL video title VAL THE BIRDIES- "THE HUCKLEBUCK '65" (1965) COL channel name VAL funknroll COL description VAL "Start a little movement in your WOH-WOH-WOH!"  "The Hucklebuck" was a Big Band and Jump Jive standard from the 40's. Everybody had a variation of it in their repertoire. The reason was that 'hucklebuck' was a euphemism for something the latter part of it rhymed with. When couples trysted to it on the dancefloor\, band leaders knew how to swing that sexual energy. It survived into Rock'n'Roll through versions like Chubby Checker's\, which may be where the Birdies learned to shake a tailfeather.   The "Girls In the Garage" CD I culled it from was no help for any info about them. (Where are Alec Palao or Lois Wilson when you need them? Hopefully making the all-girls NUGGETS box set of my dreams!) But a fan informed me they were another guise of Darlene Love & the Blossoms! Ms. Love is legendary for her chameleonic turns behind the mike under different names: The Crystals ("He's a Rebel"); Bobb B. Soxx & the Blue Jeans; and the K-C-Ettes\, behind guitarist Al Casey ("Surfin' Hootenanny"). Darlene had a funny story of evading producer Phil Spector when he was mad at her for working other studios under aliases\, but now that story sounds really ominous. Darlene is also famous for portraying Danny Glover's wife in the 'Lethal Weapon' movies\, and is just as potent a performer today.    To have a Movement\, ya gotta move first. Rock propelled the hips before it prodded people to be hip in awareness. As Feminism would soon declare\, "the personal is political".  Just the act of freeing your body\, your inhibitions\, your appearance\, your choice of partner\, or your choice of music was tantamount to a political action. In a turbulent time when the youth were starting to question everything about any arbitrary boundaries\, every move they made away from these was rebellion. No neat little boxes for them. More like a spectrum of rooms to explore and exceed. In this moment\, the air is electric with the tension of possibility...

Other members of the DSC in Bob's quartet are bassist Henk Bosch van Drakensteyn and drummer Huub Janssen. It would not be possible without an excellent pianist. His name is Marcel Hendricks. For this broadcast recorded in Restaurant-Pub de Boerenhofstede in the small town in Laren Holland they had a special guest\, Dani Dorice on vibraphone from France. Of course we all know the talent and fame of the Benny Goodman Quartet from a generation before but here is a group that every Dutchman should be proud of. These musicians swing just as confident and with the same talented skills as these former giants.  Now in 2007 Bob Kaper is the leader of the Dutch Swing College band and Marcel Hendricks its pianist.	0

COL title VAL Dark Eyes COL performer VAL Duke Robillard	COL video title VAL Dizzy Gillespie • Stan Getz • Sonny Stitt -- Dark Eyes COL channel name VAL Sublime Tunes COL description VAL From the album "For Musicians Only"  Tenor Saxophone -- Stan Getz Trumpet -- Dizzy Gillespie Alto Saxophone -- Sonny Stitt Art Direction [Original] -- Sheldon Marks Bass -- Ray Brown Drums -- Stan Levey Guitar -- Herb Ellis Piano -- John Lewis (2) Producer [Original Session] -- Norman Granz  Tracks 1. Bebop 2. Dark Eyes 3. Wee (Allen's Alley) 4. Lover Come Back To Me 5. Dark Eyes  The story behind this from my Dad's (Stan Levey) point of view is that everything was done in one take no 2nd takes no over dubbing. He had spent the whole day recording for TV\, Mission Imposible Mannix etc. so he thought a date with Stan Getz this should be pretty laid back. Well nothing could be further from the truth he said "The count offs were breath taking but once they got thru BeBop everything settled down" his favorite was Wee Allen's Alley. It was virtually a live real Bebop session\, nothing worked out\, just play by the seat of your pants or get off the bandstand. Like it or not that was the way it was with Bird and those cats\, the real thing no pretense.  Bob Levey  Source: Amazon reviews	1

Later\, it charted at #32 on the Adult Contemporary chart for Barry Manilow in 2006.   Original Billboard review: "A beautiful string styling of the move theme in Rose's characteristic manner.

COL title VAL You Do Something to Me COL performer VAL Helen Merrill	COL video title VAL Rosemary Clooney & Perez Prado - You Do Something To Me (VintageMusic.es) COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Rosemary Clooney\, disfrutó durante la década de los cincuenta de una extraordinaria fama con canciones absolutamente mediocres. De la mano de Mitch Miller\, director artístico de la casa Columbia\, aplicó el inexorable principio de que\, cuantos peores eran los arreglos y las letras de los temas\, mas beneficio económico para la discográfica. onsiguió grabar un par de duets con Frank Sinatra en 1950 y a partir de ahí le sobrevino la fama y la popularidad. Tuvo su propio show televisivo e incluso Hollywood llamó a su puerta para que participara junto a Bing Crosby y Danny Kaye en algunas comedias musicales siendo la mas celebre el film de Michael Curtiz\, "White Christmas".No obstante lo dicho\, Rosemary Clooney\, se acercó tardíamente al jazz y grabó una par de magníficos álbumes para Columbia: "The Best Of Hollywood" con la orquesta del trompetista\, Harry James\, y "Blue Rose"\, su obra mas conseguida y un disco que pudo ser memorable con la orquesta de Duke Ellington. Es la tía sanguínea del actual actor George Clooney.  Dámaso Pérez Prado (Matanzas\, Cuba\, 11 de diciembre de 1916 - Ciudad de México\, 14 de septiembre de 1989)\, el "Rey del Mambo"\, fue un músico\, compositor y arreglista cubano.Dámaso Pérez Prado es mayormente conocido por sus aportes al género del mambo\, que tiene sus orígenes en el danzón cubano y daría pauta al surgimiento y desarrollo del chachachá.Pasado el clímax del mambo\, es llamativo que Dámaso Pérez Prado\, una vez compuesta su pieza musical "Patricia" y obtenido su éxito correspondiente\, la grabase muchas veces y con diferentes arreglos\, actitud que parece demostrar que tuvo por dicha pieza una especial predilección. Entre sus composiciones más conocidas se encuentran Qué rico el mambo y Mambo Nº 5\, ésta última después lanzada en una nueva versión en 1999 por el cantante alemán Lou Bega.

Official music video for the remake of "Cool Jerk" (here cleverly retitled "Cool Jerk '90") that was recorded for the Go-Go's 1990 Greatest Hits album (cleverly title 'Greatest').  The track was produced by frequent Prince collaborator David Z. who was fresh off having a U.S. number one hit with the Fine Young Cannibals "She Drives Me Crazy"\, however the producer's signature drum snare loop sound and highly produced style didn't really mesh well with the organic pop/rock sound the Go-Go's were known for and the single tanked upon release in the Fall of 1990.   Today\, the track is often looked at with much disdain by many Go-Go's fans (and most likely) some band members themselves. However\, the video is a treat in many ways...it does have a colorful\, slick feel to it that pops out at you\, and it IS entertaining to see some of the awkward dance moves the poor band members were forced to endure. While singer Belinda Carlisle seems most comfortable with this task\, poor Gina Schock is forced to dance the cool jerk AND bang the drum at the same time..and the result is pure entertainment GOLD.   Fun fact: The video version of this song is actually a 'remix' of the remixed/remade Cool Jerk ('90) that appears on the album 'Greatest'.	0

COL title VAL All or Nothing COL performer VAL Small Faces	COL video title VAL Marlene Dietrich ft Victor Young's Orchestra - You Go To My Head (Decca Records 1939) COL channel name VAL RoundMidnightTV COL description VAL "You Go to My Head" is a 1938 popular song composed by J. Fred Coots with lyrics by Haven Gillespie. The song is a unique conjunction of a sophisticated lyric and complex\, lush harmonic structure by two songwriters who were not generally known for such elegance; nevertheless the song is highly regarded by jazz musicians and critics alike. The song was first recorded in 1938 by Teddy Wilson with a vocal by Nan Wynn. The same year it was recorded by Billie Holiday. On 23 April 1961\, Judy Garland performed the song at the "Judy at Carnegie Hall" concert.   Marie Magdalene "Marlene" Dietrich (December 27\, 1901 – May 6\,1992) was a German-American actress and singer. Dietrich maintained popularity throughout her unusually long show business career by continually re-inventing herself\, professionally and characteristically. In 1920s Berlin\, she acted on the stage and in silent films. Her performance as Lola-Lola in The Blue Angel (1930)\, directed by Josef von Sternberg\, brought her international fame resulting in a contract with Paramount Pictures. Dietrich starred in Hollywood films such as Morocco (1930)\, Shanghai Express (1932) and Desire (1936). Dietrich successfully traded on her glamorous persona and "exotic" (to Americans) looks\, cementing her super-stardom and becoming one of the highest-paid actresses of the era. Dietrich became a U.S. citizen in 1939\, and throughout the Second World War she was a high-profile frontline entertainer. Although she still made occasional films after the end of the Second World War\, Dietrich spent most of the 1950s to the 1970s touring the world as a marquee live-show performer. Dietrich was noted for her humanitarian efforts during the War\, housing German and French exiles\, providing financial support\, and even advocating for their US citizenship. For her work improving morale on the front lines in WWII\, she received honors from the US\, France\, Belgium\, and Israel. In 1999\, the American Film Institute named Dietrich the ninth-greatest female star of classic Hollywood cinema.  You go to my head And you linger like a haunting refrain And I find you spinning round in my brain Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne  You go to my head Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew And I find the very mention of you Like the kicker in a julep or two  The thrill of the thought That you might give a thought To my plea\, casts a spell over me Still I say to myself Get a hold of yourself Can't you see that this never can be  You go to my head With a smile that makes my temperature rise Like a summer with a thousand July's You intoxicate my soul with your eyes  Though I'm certain that this heart of mine Hasn't a ghost of a chance In this crazy romance You go to my head  You go to my head With a smile that makes my temperature rise Like a summer with a thousand July's You intoxicate my soul with your eyes  Though I'm certain that this heart of mine Hasn't a ghost of a chance In this crazy romance You go to my head You go to my head	0

COL title VAL Old Folks COL performer VAL Eddie Henderson	COL video title VAL The Bards - Goodtime Charlie's Got The Blues (1969 - Re-recording of their original version) COL channel name VAL ElvisKlan COL description VAL Info and label taken from David Neale websites: http://davidneale.eu/elvis/originals/list3.html#S1218 http://davidneale.eu/elvis/labels/get-back---i-gotta-know/index.html  Composer Danny O'Keefe recorded this number on no less than three separate occasions. He probably recorded the first version in 1967\, either for the Jerden label\, or for Piccadilly\, but it was not released; then came a version on the Cotillion label in 1971; finally O'Keefe recorded his hit version for the Signpost label in 1972. In the meantime\, however\, a relatively unknown group called The Bards\, from Moses Lake\, Washington\, recorded the number and released it in January 1969 on the Jerden label (Jerden 907) and a few months later on the Parrot label (Parrot 45-337). Elvis did not sing the lines "I got my pills to ease the pain\, Can't find a thing to ease my brain." Well\, that's what you read everywhere\, but according to The Bards' guitarist\, Mardi Sheridan\, the lines were\, in fact\, "Got my pills to ease the pain\, Can't find a thing to ease the rain." The Bards own site : bardsmusic.com   I thank Mike of The Bards for allowing me to put the song on Youtube. Here are some informations he sent me :  'Bards' is an old English word meaning musician\, minstrel\, poet\, or entertainer. The story behind our use of The Bards as the name of our '60's band was wanting to emulate the Beatles (of course\, British musicians). Also\, since we were more into writing music than writing lyrics\, we decided to take some classic poetry and put it to rock music. The story of our band is memorialized here: http://bardsmusic.com'   'The picture you refer to of us was taken in 2002. (for Youtube users: it's the last picture in the video) Wow\, 10 years ago already. There was a 4th Bard\, the drummer\, who passed\, but our reunion was inspired by an interesting series of events. Just for kicks\, back around 2001 I Googled The Bards and found a number of links and information\, including a compilation CD that had one of my songs on it. Of course\, I ordered it and later got a call from a producer who specialized in releasing previously un-released music from the 60's and 70's. He somehow knew about an album of material we had that was produced by the highly successful production team of Curt Boetcher and Keith Olson. We were basically high school kids from a small eastern Washing town called Moses Lake. We went to 'Hollywood' with our 'garage band' tapes\, met Keith and Curt in an elevator and long story short\, ended up with an albums worth of music that never got released because the new label they were trying to start didn't get financing. Anyway\, 35 years later we did release it as a result of that Google search. That's what inspired the Moses Lake Recordings\, The Bards Music web site tribute (where all of this is reported) and that reunion where the picture was taken. Anyway\, I still marvel at how the internet managed to 'transcend' space and time\, bringing that music out of obscurity\, as well as rekindling the relationship of the surviving band members'.

Among other tracks\, the album featured Davis' interpretations of two contemporary pop songs: Cyndi Laupers "Time After Time" and Michael Jacksons "Human Natute".  During the recording sessions\, Darryl Jones (A/K/A "The Munch:" Bass) introduced Sting to his longtime idol Miles Davis. Sting was startled when Davis asked him if he could speak French\, and since he did\, to translate the Miranda Warning into French and yell it into the microphone against a backing track.  Miranda Warning is a warning given by police in the United States to criminal suspects in police custody\, or in a custodial situation\, before they are interrogated : You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney\, one will be appointed to you. Do you understand these rights as they have been read to you?  The Miranda warnings were mandated by the 1966 United States Supreme Court decision in the case of Miranda v. Arizona as a means of protecting a criminal suspect's Fifth Amendment right to avoid coercive self-incrimination (see right to silence). The reading of the Miranda warning might be omitted during arrest\, such as if the evidence is already sufficient to indict\, or if the suspect is talkative and volunteers information (without being asked). The admissibility of conversations\, as evidence\, is judged on a case-by-case basis\, subject to appeal.	0

Written by Jimmy Kennedy and Michael Carr.  SOUTH OF THE BORDER  South of the border\, down Mexico way\, That's where I fell in love When the stars above came out to play. And now as I wander\, my thoughts ever stray South of the border\, down Mexico way.  She was a picture in old Spanish lace. And for a tender while I kissed the smile upon her face. For it was fiesta\, and we were so gay South of the border\, Mexico way.  Then she sighed as she whispered 'manana' Never dreaming that we were parting. And I lied as I whispered 'manana' For our tomorrow never came.  South of the border\, I rode back one day There in a veil of white by candlelight She knelt to pray. The mission bells told me that I mustn't stay South of the border\, down Mexico way.  Ai-ai-ai-ai (ai-ai-ai-ai) Ai-ai-ai-ai (ai-ai-ai-ai) Ai-ai-ai-ai ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  From Wiki:  "South of the Border" is a popular song describing a trip to Mexico\, written by Jimmy Kennedy and Michael Carr and published in 1939 for the film of the same name starring country star Gene Autry.[1]  In the lyrics\, a man looks back with regret and pain for having lied to the woman he can't forget ("...and now as I wander\, my thoughts ever stray...") and returned for too late\, just as she was preparing for marriage. The lyric is in juxtaposition with the music\, which swings with syncopated joy.  The song was a hit in 1939 for Shep Fields\, vocal by Hal Derwin. It has been recorded by many artists\, but the best-known versions are by Autry and Frank Sinatra (1953). The song was recorded in August 1961 by Patsy Cline for her album Patsy Cline Showcase and appears on Herb Alpert's 1964 album South of the Border.	0

COL title VAL Little Girl Blue COL performer VAL Carmen Gomes Inc.	COL video title VAL Sam Cooke - Little Girl Blue (original vinyl rip) 1961 COL channel name VAL smazexd COL description VAL When we decided to do a "blues" album with Sam Cooke\, we got together dozens of publishers' folders containing the old blues tunes that have become semi-classics of the business. As we pored over these one evening with Sam\, we could see something troubling him. To our question\, Sam answered\, "these songs are all right\, I guess\, but they're not my kinda blues."  To understand this statement\, you have to understand a little bit about Sam Cooke. He is a young man. He has been brought up in a new generation of music\, and within this new music\, he has created his own style and sound. Sam Cooke is gifted with that rare ability to be an individual performer and interpreter of music. Still\, his repertoire is drawn from the music of the past decade or so\, music that he has grown up with and that he knows best.  Sam Cooke has found the blues in the most unexpected of all places . . . right in our own backyard\, so to speak. He has taken the current standards that we have danced or hummed to so many times\, without thinking of the lyrical meaning\, and has given them a fresh meaning. What could be sadder\, really\, than a young man pleading\, "Don't Get Around Much Anymore..." or\, "Nobody Knows When You're Down And Out." Many a time\, a crowded dance floor has been happily jumping with the sounds of Out In The Cold Again\, or But Not For Me\, with not one couple thinking about the message contained in these songs\, Sam Cooke makes you think about it as he digs deep into the lyric and gives you the message in no uncertain terms. Chances are\, you will think of these tunes as "blues" from now on. And they are\, as Sam says... "That's my kinda blues."	1

Will it make it easier on you\, now you got someone to blame? You say one love\, one life\, when it's one need in the night. One love\, we get to share it Leaves you baby if you don't care for it.  Did I disappoint you or leave a bad taste in your mouth? You act like you never had love and you want me to go without. Well\, it's too late tonight to drag the past out into the light. We're one\, but we're not the same. We get to carry each other\, carry each other... one  Have you come here for forgiveness\, Have you come to raise the dead Have you come here to play Jesus to the lepers in your head Did I ask too much\, more than a lot You gave me nothing\, now it's all I got. We're one\, but we're not the same. Well\, we hurt each other\, then we do it again.  You say love is a temple\, love a higher law Love is a temple\, love the higher law. You ask me to enter\, but then you make me crawl And I can't be holding on to what you got\, when all you got is hurt.  One love\, one blood\, one life\, you got to do what you should. One life with each other: sisters\, brothers. One life\, but we're not the same. We get to carry each other\, carry each other. One\, one.	0

Pubblicata nel 1938\, la canzone fu inserita nel musical di Broadway "This Way" \,in cui venne  eseguita dal cantante Tamara Drasin\, che aveva qualche anno prima cantato "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes". Il brano è uno standard jazz\, ed è statoinciso da numerosi artisti nel corso degli anni. Il tema musicale ha potere emotivo\, ed è stato molto amato durante la seconda guerra mondiale\, quando divenne un inno per coloro che prestavano servizio all'estero (dai soldati britannici e  americani). La versione più ricordata è quella di Billie Holiday (1944) e altrettanto nota è quella di Bing Crosby dello stesso anno\, dal film omonimo con  Ginger Rogers and Joseph Cotten. Mina la propone nel suo album "12 American Songbook" del 2012.

COL title VAL God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen COL performer VAL August Burns Red	COL video title VAL Michel Legrand Orchestra - My Funny Valentine COL channel name VAL ifcopod COL description VAL Michel Legrand rarely replicates treatment of songs. Richard Rodgers' My Funny Valentine has benefited from myriad interpretations. The first here from 1974 shot through with rapid string interjections featuring jazz harmonica Toots Thielemans.If you dont like this arrangement join a  club~  Your   own club because  some  sad to say   come a cropper on this type of Legrand  Why does he not play the music straight ? Thats the  point    People who have problems with this probably  are not too keen on  the orchestra  in the first place. An  "on your toes"  encapsulation of  Legrand  is his ever alert ever   changing ~   approach ..  The second  styling  from 1962 features alto saxist Phil Woods capped superbly by Bill Costa\, Warren Smith\, Gary Burton (vibes) and a battery of percussion. The mood is cool jazz the arrangement   ~ Legrand. Have you noticed a wholly sneaky thing  happening on U Tube. A  raft of stuff  disappearing from our midst.Point in question. 1963  Reprise  album    Duke Ellingtons Symphonic Ellington    appeared some time ago  leaving Ifcopod  and musical confreres   in a delirious state of expectation. Suddenly   "now you see it now you dont"   all vamoosed  before  the word google might  censoriously  escape  from   pursed parchment  lips  Judge Judy.  .Luckily I had a copy of " la Scala She too pretty"  a delightful highlight  from Symphonic Ellington instinct with typical Ellington  orchestral  nuance nevertheless it would have been handy to have a U Tube copy on standby.  The slaughter  continues apace.  Whole wodges of stuff is getting  similar treatment ". I thought i was away on a hack  mentally storing up all  downloadable prospects. Any  in particular? Now that you ask.  Lady is a Tramp  by your friend and mine George Siravo Orchestra.  but  a slew of U Tube goodies  dangled before   greedy  eyes  suddenly snatched away  what can a  person say?. Let me  asseverate~ this is below the belt.   Now   scramble for  asseveration  in the dictionary  Last time asseveration  was invoked   someone  said surely you  mean assertion. and so our  anecdote totters to a hapless  demise.	0

In December 1964 his orchestra released an album of cover versions of Themes from the James Bond Thrillers to coincide with the American release of Goldfinger. The popularity of Shaw's arrangements of Bond themes led to More Themes from the James Bond Thrillers for the release ofThunderball with tracks from both albums released on a UK album called James Bond in Action. In 1966 Shaw's orchestra performed Themes for Secret Agents.Themes from the James Bond Thrillers Vol.3/More James Bond in Action followed the release of Casino Royale and You Only Live Twice in 1967. Shaw came back in 1971 for The Return of James Bond/The Phase 4 World of Spy Thrillers for the release of Sean Connery's return as Bond in Diamonds Are Forever. Shaw recruited guitarist Vic Flick to repeat his guitar playing on the Gypsy Camp track. Shaw arranged music for films such as Summer Holiday (1963) and The Secret of My Success (1965) and wrote the score for Straight on Till Morning.

COL title VAL Mas Que Nada COL performer VAL Ana Caram	COL video title VAL Seventy Six Trombones - Henry Mancini and His Orchestra COL channel name VAL Lloyd T. COL description VAL Seventy-six Trombones is the signature song from the musical play The Music Man (1957)\, which was written by Meredith Willson. This song also appeared in the film The Music Man (1962)\, and in the made-for-TV movie adaptation in 2003. It is also a piece commonly played by marching and military bands. Seventy-six trombones led the big parade With a hundred and ten cornets close at hand ... In one of Willson's arrangements of the song\, it seamlessly integrates with other popular marches at the time\, such as Stars and Stripes Forever and The Washington Post March by John Philip Sousa (in whose band Willson had played)\, the The National Emblem March by Edwin Eugene Bagley\, the Swedish song Under the Blue and Yellow Flag by Viktor Widqvist\, and the song the Second Regiment\, Connecticut National Guard by D.W. Reeves. In the dramas\, "Professor" Harold Hill uses the song Seventy-six trombones to help the townspeople of the fictional town of River City\, Iowa\, visualize their children playing in a marching band by harkening back to a time when he saw several famous bandleaders' bands in a combined performance. Whereas an average-sized high school marching band might have about 10 musicians playing the trombone\, and a large college marching band seldom has more than 30 trombonists\, the band that Harold describes to the villagers included 76 trombones\, 110 cornets\, "over a thousand reeds"\, double bell euphoniums\, and "fifty mounted cannon" (which were popular in bands of the time). The love ballad Goodnight\, My Someone\, which immediately precedes Seventy-six Trombones in the musicals\, has the same tune but it is played in 3/4 metre - with a much slower tempo. In Willson's hometown of Mason City\, Iowa\, they honor this song (and the rest of the story of The Music Man) in a building called "Music Man Square"\, which is located next to Willson's boyhood home. In one large room\, they have 76 donated trombones hanging from the ceiling.	0

It was the first hit from New Orleans to be accepted into rock and roll. The word "lawdy" means Lord.

The  closing theme to 'The Liberace Show' & his on-stage performances.   Note: There is "0"evidence of Liberace being homosexual/gay. He was once engaged to actress Joanne Rio & frequently dated countless other women; not men! He testified (under oath) & denied being homosexual (or ever taken part in homosexual practices) in a 1956 defamation trial against the Daily Mirror. He further won a libel suit (1957) against Confidential Magazine for publishing a malicious article alluding to him being a homosexual. In Liberace's biography 'The Wonderful 'Private' World of Liberace' there is no mention of him being homosexual\, engaging in homosexual practices\, or an affair with Scott Thorson??? Chapter Three does mention his affairs with women. Liberace was not gay!!!	1

Son nom est souvent associé à celui du parolier Hal David. Ils ont produit une œuvre considérable et reconnue qui fait du tandem Bacharach et David deux des plus grands compositeurs de la musique populaire américaine des années 1960 aux années 2000.  Burt Bacharach (Kansas City\, Missouri\, 12 de maio de 1928) é um pianista e compositor norte-americano. Nos anos 50 e começo dos 60 ele foi o pianista e maestro de Marlene Dietrich. Ele se juntou ao letrista Hal David e outros para escrever várias canções populares nos anos 60 e 70.  Burt Bacharach (* 12. Mai 1928 in Kansas City\, Missouri) ist ein US-amerikanischer Pianist und Komponist. Seit 1957 gehört er zu den erfolgreichsten Komponisten Amerikas\, rund 130 seiner Werke haben die Single-Charts seiner Heimat erreicht.  Ein Großteil seiner Lieder entstand in langjähriger Zusammenarbeit mit dem Texter Hal David und im Anschluss daran mit Carole Bayer Sager.

COL title VAL A View to a Kill COL performer VAL Northern Kings	COL video title VAL Dr. John: Dippermouth Blues (featuring James “12” Andrews) COL channel name VAL Concord Records COL description VAL Amazon: http://smarturl.it/SpiritSatchCD  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee and six-time GRAMMY®-winner Dr. John is New Orleans' most prominent living musical icon. The embodiment of his hometown's freewheeling creative spirit and multiple musical traditions\, he's built a visionary\, idiosyncratic body of work that's deeply rooted in the Crescent City's myriad blues\, R&B\, jazz and rock 'n' roll traditions. So it's fitting that Dr. John's August 19\, 2014 release on Concord Records\, Ske-Dat-De-Dat...The Spirit Of Satch\, pays heartfelt tribute to another larger-than-life New Orleans legend: the seminal trumpeter and vocalist Louis "Satchmo" Armstrong\, whose musical innovations created the template for 20th-century jazz\, and whose playful attitude and life-embracing spirit made him a beloved figure whose worldwide appeal transcended music. "He's the most famous guy that ever came out of my neighborhood\," notes Dr. John. "He became a legend all over\, for his trumpet playin' and everything else\, and he was the United States' ambassador to the world."  Ske-Dat-De-Dat...The Spirit Of Satch honors Armstrong's musical genius as well as his effervescent personality with 13 quintessential numbers drawn from various phases of Armstrong's five-decade career\, with Dr. John joined by a stellar supporting cast that manages to update the material while maintaining the music's timeless emotional appeal. In addition to Dr. John's trademark vocals and piano\, and backup from some of New Orleans' finest musicians\, Ske-Dat-De-Dat…The Spirit Of Satch features a stellar assortment of guest singers and players. Bonnie Raitt shares the spotlight on a swinging reading of "I've Got the World on a String\," Ledisi and the McCrary Sisters lend gospel authority to "Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen\," Anthony Hamilton is featured on a mournful "Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child\," Shemekia Copeland trades verses with Dr. John on a playful reworking on "Sweet Hunk O' Trash\," and the Blind Boys of Alabama lend their powerful voices to "What a Wonderful World" and "Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams."   -uploaded in HD at http://www.TunesToTube.com	0

Official music video for the remake of "Cool Jerk" (here cleverly retitled "Cool Jerk '90") that was recorded for the Go-Go's 1990 Greatest Hits album (cleverly title 'Greatest').  The track was produced by frequent Prince collaborator David Z. who was fresh off having a U.S. number one hit with the Fine Young Cannibals "She Drives Me Crazy"\, however the producer's signature drum snare loop sound and highly produced style didn't really mesh well with the organic pop/rock sound the Go-Go's were known for and the single tanked upon release in the Fall of 1990.   Today\, the track is often looked at with much disdain by many Go-Go's fans (and most likely) some band members themselves. However\, the video is a treat in many ways...it does have a colorful\, slick feel to it that pops out at you\, and it IS entertaining to see some of the awkward dance moves the poor band members were forced to endure. While singer Belinda Carlisle seems most comfortable with this task\, poor Gina Schock is forced to dance the cool jerk AND bang the drum at the same time..and the result is pure entertainment GOLD.   Fun fact: The video version of this song is actually a 'remix' of the remixed/remade Cool Jerk ('90) that appears on the album 'Greatest'.	0

COL title VAL Shape of You COL performer VAL Mike Tompkins	COL video title VAL Rosemary Clooney & Perez Prado - You Do Something To Me (VintageMusic.es) COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Rosemary Clooney\, disfrutó durante la década de los cincuenta de una extraordinaria fama con canciones absolutamente mediocres. De la mano de Mitch Miller\, director artístico de la casa Columbia\, aplicó el inexorable principio de que\, cuantos peores eran los arreglos y las letras de los temas\, mas beneficio económico para la discográfica. onsiguió grabar un par de duets con Frank Sinatra en 1950 y a partir de ahí le sobrevino la fama y la popularidad. Tuvo su propio show televisivo e incluso Hollywood llamó a su puerta para que participara junto a Bing Crosby y Danny Kaye en algunas comedias musicales siendo la mas celebre el film de Michael Curtiz\, "White Christmas".No obstante lo dicho\, Rosemary Clooney\, se acercó tardíamente al jazz y grabó una par de magníficos álbumes para Columbia: "The Best Of Hollywood" con la orquesta del trompetista\, Harry James\, y "Blue Rose"\, su obra mas conseguida y un disco que pudo ser memorable con la orquesta de Duke Ellington. Es la tía sanguínea del actual actor George Clooney.  Dámaso Pérez Prado (Matanzas\, Cuba\, 11 de diciembre de 1916 - Ciudad de México\, 14 de septiembre de 1989)\, el "Rey del Mambo"\, fue un músico\, compositor y arreglista cubano.Dámaso Pérez Prado es mayormente conocido por sus aportes al género del mambo\, que tiene sus orígenes en el danzón cubano y daría pauta al surgimiento y desarrollo del chachachá.Pasado el clímax del mambo\, es llamativo que Dámaso Pérez Prado\, una vez compuesta su pieza musical "Patricia" y obtenido su éxito correspondiente\, la grabase muchas veces y con diferentes arreglos\, actitud que parece demostrar que tuvo por dicha pieza una especial predilección. Entre sus composiciones más conocidas se encuentran Qué rico el mambo y Mambo Nº 5\, ésta última después lanzada en una nueva versión en 1999 por el cantante alemán Lou Bega.

COL title VAL L'amour est bleu COL performer VAL Vicky	COL video title VAL Ella Fitzgerald - No Other Love COL channel name VAL Alissa Lovera COL description VAL Talk about a rara avis -- for four decades\, Ella Sings Broadway has been the most obscure and hard to find of Ella Fitzgerald's classic Verve albums. Those who did invest the time and money in unearthing it were amply rewarded: The set is a perfect complement to Fitzgerald's classic series of Song Book albums. Unlike the Song Books\, however\, Ella Sings Broadway concentrates not on the time-honored history of The Great White Way and its stellar songwriters\, but on songs and shows by writers that were part of Broadway's recent past: Rodgers and Hammerstein (South Pacific\, Me and Juliet) Adler and Ross (Damn Yankees\, The Pajama Game)\, Frank Loesser (Guys and Dolls)\, and Lerner and Loewe (Brigadoon\, My Fair Lady).  This overlooked gem of an album was arranged and conducted by Marty Paich\, the man responsible for such other Fitzgerald triumphs as Ella Swings Brightly and Whisper Not -- which places Ella Sings Broadway in most excellent company.  www.vervemusicgroup.com	0

COL title VAL O Holy Night COL performer VAL Laura Whidden	COL video title VAL O Holy Night. - Tevin Campbell (A Very Special Christmas Vol\, 2) COL channel name VAL TsDSeason2BJolly COL description VAL Tevin Campbell Biography Tevin Jermod Campbell (born November 12\, 1976) is a five-time Grammy-nominated American R&B singer-songwriter. Campbell scored a string of R&B chart hits as a teenager in the early to mid-1990s. Campbell transitioned from child singer to adult R&B crooner\, and is a recognizable figure in the New Jack Swing genre of music.  Born in Dallas\, Texas\, Campbell was introduced to the R&B by Quincy Jones in August 1989. Campbell's debut single was "Tomorrow (A Better You Better Me)" which reached number 1 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip hop Singles chart in June 1990. It was the lead single from Quincy Jones' critically acclaimed ensemble LP Back on the Block which won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1991. After working with Jones and writers and producers including Siedah Garrett\, Campbell worked with producers Narada Michael Walden\, Al B. Sure\, Babyface\, and others to record additional music.  Campbell's first solo hit was "Round and Round"\, which charted at #3 on R&B charts in November 1991 and #13 on the Billboard Hot 100 in April 1991 was produced by Prince and was featured in Prince's film Graffiti Bridge. Campbell followed the success of his first two singles by releasing his debut album\, T.E.V.I.N.\, in November 1991 which featured the R&B hit singles and Campbell's only #1 Adult Contemporary hit: "Tell Me What You Want Me To Do" followed by:\, "Alone With You"\, and "Goodbye". His second album\, I'm Ready released October 1993\, yielded the #1 R&B hit and #9 pop single "Can We Talk" in December 1993\, "I'm Ready"\, "Always in My Heart" which charted at #3 on the R&B chart. He also scored a Top 30 hit with "Don't Say Goodbye Girl" on the R&B charts. In September 1994\, Campbell also scored an R&B hit with the single "U Will Know" as part of the R&B supergroup Black Men United\, a group that also included singer Usher.  The year 1996 saw the release of his third album\, Back to the World (#11 R&B). The title track was a success (hitting the R&B Top 20)\, but additional singles failed to make an impact on the chart. His early 1999 self-titled album was found Campbell venturing into the neo-soul venue. The project was rushed\, and as a result charted below the R&B Top 30\, with only one single charting\, a Top 30 song called "Another Way".  Campbell was nominated for five Grammy Awards and two American Music Awards.	1

Credited as simply Damita Jo\, DeBlanc had some chart success in the early 1960s with two answer songs: 1960's "I'll Save the Last Dance for You" (an answer to "Save the Last Dance for Me") and 1961's "I'll Be There" (an answer to "Stand By Me"). Both songs were originally sung by Ben E. King and made the R&B top 20\, and "I'll Be There" also reached number 12 on the pop chart. In 1962 she recorded "Dance With a Dolly (With a Hole in her Stocking"\, previously made famous by The Andrews Sisters and Bill Haley\, for Mercury Records.

Written by Jimmy Kennedy and Michael Carr.  SOUTH OF THE BORDER  South of the border\, down Mexico way\, That's where I fell in love When the stars above came out to play. And now as I wander\, my thoughts ever stray South of the border\, down Mexico way.  She was a picture in old Spanish lace. And for a tender while I kissed the smile upon her face. For it was fiesta\, and we were so gay South of the border\, Mexico way.  Then she sighed as she whispered 'manana' Never dreaming that we were parting. And I lied as I whispered 'manana' For our tomorrow never came.  South of the border\, I rode back one day There in a veil of white by candlelight She knelt to pray. The mission bells told me that I mustn't stay South of the border\, down Mexico way.  Ai-ai-ai-ai (ai-ai-ai-ai) Ai-ai-ai-ai (ai-ai-ai-ai) Ai-ai-ai-ai ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  From Wiki:  "South of the Border" is a popular song describing a trip to Mexico\, written by Jimmy Kennedy and Michael Carr and published in 1939 for the film of the same name starring country star Gene Autry.[1]  In the lyrics\, a man looks back with regret and pain for having lied to the woman he can't forget ("...and now as I wander\, my thoughts ever stray...") and returned for too late\, just as she was preparing for marriage. The lyric is in juxtaposition with the music\, which swings with syncopated joy.  The song was a hit in 1939 for Shep Fields\, vocal by Hal Derwin. It has been recorded by many artists\, but the best-known versions are by Autry and Frank Sinatra (1953). The song was recorded in August 1961 by Patsy Cline for her album Patsy Cline Showcase and appears on Herb Alpert's 1964 album South of the Border.	0

COL title VAL Goodnight My Love COL performer VAL Gloria Estefan	COL video title VAL AT LAST ~ Charlie Spivak & His Orchestra (1942) COL channel name VAL MrRJDB1969 COL description VAL "At Last" ~ Charlie Spivak & His Orchestra w/ Garry Stevens & The Stardusters  (1942)  Columbia Records #36642 Flip side of\, "People Like You And Me"   Charlie Spivak was often billed as "The Sweetest Trumpet In The World" . In my opinion\, Spivak\, Harry James\, & Billy Butterfield & a few others\, were probably some of the best "sweet" trumpet players to come out of the "Big Band Era" .  He started out in the early 1920's and by the time he formed his orchestra in 1939\, he had already played with such orchestra's fronted by \, Paul Specht\, Ben Pollack\, The Dorsey Brother's\, Bob Crosby\,  Tommy Dorsey\, & Jack Teagarden.  The Stardusters \, consisting of Glen Gaylon\, Curt Purnell\, & Dick Wylder started out as a trio while still in high school and upon graduation \, they decided to follow their dreams of a vocal career\, instead of attending Yale.  By 1939 and after several guest appearances\, they landed their very own radio program on NBC.  June Hutton \, Ina Ray Hutton's younger sister and once member of The Quintones vocal group\,   joined the original Stardusters in approx. 1940 and the group was complete.  They recorded WHEN I SEE AN ELEPHANT FLY\, AT LAST\, I SURRENDER DEAR\, A WEEKEND IN HAVANA\, THIS IS NO LAUGHING MATTER\, BROTHER BILL\, &  I REMEMBER YOU and a few others with Charlie Spivak's Orchestra. They later recorded with several popular vocalists of the day\, including  Evelyn Knight\, with whom they recorded the 1949 hit \, A LITTLE BIRD TOLD ME.	0

Dark Eyes  The story behind this from my Dad's (Stan Levey) point of view is that everything was done in one take no 2nd takes no over dubbing. He had spent the whole day recording for TV\, Mission Imposible Mannix etc. so he thought a date with Stan Getz this should be pretty laid back. Well nothing could be further from the truth he said "The count offs were breath taking but once they got thru BeBop everything settled down" his favorite was Wee Allen's Alley. It was virtually a live real Bebop session\, nothing worked out\, just play by the seat of your pants or get off the bandstand. Like it or not that was the way it was with Bird and those cats\, the real thing no pretense.  Bob Levey  Source: Amazon reviews	0

COL title VAL The Way We Were COL performer VAL Bing Crosby	COL video title VAL The Sweet Inspirations - Let It Be Me COL channel name VAL Kerith Louisa Williams-Catton COL description VAL Info: The Sweet Inspirations were an American R&B girl group mostly known for their work as backup singers on studio recordings for other R&B and rock artists. A founding member of the group was Dionne Warwick\, who was later replaced by her aunt\, Cissy Houston. The Sweet Inspirations was founded by former members of The Drinkard Singers\, a long-running Gospel singing group whose membership included Cissy Houston (née Drinkard\, and mother of Whitney Houston\, 1963) and Lee Warwick\, who was Cissy's sister and the mother of Sweet Inspirations members Dee Dee and Dionne Warwick). As a backup group\, the Sweet Inspirations were in high demand among producers\, publishers\, artists\, and songwriters in the early 1960s. The original lineup included Doris Troy and the two Warwick sisters Dionne & Dee Dee. Sylvia Shemwell (sister of Judy Clay) replaced Troy\, while Cissy Houston took over from Dionne\, with Dee Dee Warwick as the group's official leader. The group sang backup for many stars\, including Solomon Burke\, Aretha Franklin\, Wilson Pickett\, and Esther Phillips. Dee Dee left in 1965\, when her solo career began to take off. She was replaced by Myrna Smith. Estelle Brown joined the team soon after\, and the line-up that was to become an Atlantic recording group was set. The Sweet Inspirations recorded by themselves for the first time in April 1967 for Atlantic Records. That session produced the first two singles released by Atlantic\, a version of "Why (Am I Treated So Bad)\," a song previously recorded by The Staple Singers and a soulful version of "Let It Be Me"\, a French song which had been a pop and R&B hit for Betty Everett & Jerry Butler in 1964.	0

COL title VAL Two Trains Running COL performer VAL Maxwell Street Jimmy Davis	COL video title VAL Lorez Alexandria -- I'm Glad There Is You (1957) COL channel name VAL JazzyRNA COL description VAL Continuing with saga of America's most gifted\, and underrated jazz vocalists—this particular artist takes the cake—not meaning the particular term in a negative connotation\, but it's such a pity that a remarkable songstress—the incomparable\, Lorez Alexandria is not afforded the recognition that she so deserves. This is proven true\, given the fact that I recently discovered her albums—and I just haven't had my fill. I've searched and purchased everything I could find from such a gifted songstress. Lorez crafts each lyric with such grace and tonality that could easily match (if not surpass) the reigning jazz stylists of the bop/jazz/pop age. She gives each standard a new sense of evocative meaning as far as lyrics are concerned\, and reinvents the wheel each time she unleashes her enthralling voice. As she once said "A lyric is dead\, until you breathe life into it." This is exactly what she does. Enjoy and listen in HD\, to the lovely—Lorez Alexandria. All right(s) to 1957 King Records\, Inc	0

Among other tracks\, the album featured Davis' interpretations of two contemporary pop songs: Cyndi Laupers "Time After Time" and Michael Jacksons "Human Natute".  During the recording sessions\, Darryl Jones (A/K/A "The Munch:" Bass) introduced Sting to his longtime idol Miles Davis. Sting was startled when Davis asked him if he could speak French\, and since he did\, to translate the Miranda Warning into French and yell it into the microphone against a backing track.  Miranda Warning is a warning given by police in the United States to criminal suspects in police custody\, or in a custodial situation\, before they are interrogated : You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney\, one will be appointed to you. Do you understand these rights as they have been read to you?  The Miranda warnings were mandated by the 1966 United States Supreme Court decision in the case of Miranda v. Arizona as a means of protecting a criminal suspect's Fifth Amendment right to avoid coercive self-incrimination (see right to silence). The reading of the Miranda warning might be omitted during arrest\, such as if the evidence is already sufficient to indict\, or if the suspect is talkative and volunteers information (without being asked). The admissibility of conversations\, as evidence\, is judged on a case-by-case basis\, subject to appeal.	0

COL title VAL Stealin' Apples COL performer VAL Flashback Quartet	COL video title VAL Blowin' In The Wind By The Chad Mitchell Trio COL channel name VAL CompVid101 COL description VAL The Chad Mitchell Trio performs what was the first commercial recording of the Bob Dylan classic other than by Dylan himself.  The song had been brought to the CMT by their musical director and arranger\, Milt Okun\, and the Trio (already famous for its satirical political songs) was eager to record the number\, release it as a single\, and title what would be their third album after it.  An old school producer at the group's Kapp Records label vetoed the ideas\, however\, maintaining that "no song with death in the lyrics was ever a hit\,"  and the album was released as "The Chad Mitchell Trio In Action."  Okun\, however\, was also the musical director and arranger for another young and eager folk trio called Peter\, Paul\, and Mary\, and he brought the song to them. PP&M did everything that the CMT had wanted to do with the song. They titled an album "In The Wind\," released the song as a single (it sold a million copies and hit #2 on the "Billboard" charts) and performed the number before ML King's "I have a dream " speech during the August\, 1963 civil rights March On Washington. The success of the song made both Dylan and PP&M household names in the U.S.  The Chad Mitchell Trio still performs with its original lineup\, and its fans often wonder "what if....?" about the group's stirring version of the song.	0

COL title VAL Can't Sit Down COL performer VAL The Delmonas	COL video title VAL O Holy Night. - Tevin Campbell (A Very Special Christmas Vol\, 2) COL channel name VAL TsDSeason2BJolly COL description VAL Tevin Campbell Biography Tevin Jermod Campbell (born November 12\, 1976) is a five-time Grammy-nominated American R&B singer-songwriter. Campbell scored a string of R&B chart hits as a teenager in the early to mid-1990s. Campbell transitioned from child singer to adult R&B crooner\, and is a recognizable figure in the New Jack Swing genre of music.  Born in Dallas\, Texas\, Campbell was introduced to the R&B by Quincy Jones in August 1989. Campbell's debut single was "Tomorrow (A Better You Better Me)" which reached number 1 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip hop Singles chart in June 1990. It was the lead single from Quincy Jones' critically acclaimed ensemble LP Back on the Block which won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1991. After working with Jones and writers and producers including Siedah Garrett\, Campbell worked with producers Narada Michael Walden\, Al B. Sure\, Babyface\, and others to record additional music.  Campbell's first solo hit was "Round and Round"\, which charted at #3 on R&B charts in November 1991 and #13 on the Billboard Hot 100 in April 1991 was produced by Prince and was featured in Prince's film Graffiti Bridge. Campbell followed the success of his first two singles by releasing his debut album\, T.E.V.I.N.\, in November 1991 which featured the R&B hit singles and Campbell's only #1 Adult Contemporary hit: "Tell Me What You Want Me To Do" followed by:\, "Alone With You"\, and "Goodbye". His second album\, I'm Ready released October 1993\, yielded the #1 R&B hit and #9 pop single "Can We Talk" in December 1993\, "I'm Ready"\, "Always in My Heart" which charted at #3 on the R&B chart. He also scored a Top 30 hit with "Don't Say Goodbye Girl" on the R&B charts. In September 1994\, Campbell also scored an R&B hit with the single "U Will Know" as part of the R&B supergroup Black Men United\, a group that also included singer Usher.  The year 1996 saw the release of his third album\, Back to the World (#11 R&B). The title track was a success (hitting the R&B Top 20)\, but additional singles failed to make an impact on the chart. His early 1999 self-titled album was found Campbell venturing into the neo-soul venue. The project was rushed\, and as a result charted below the R&B Top 30\, with only one single charting\, a Top 30 song called "Another Way".  Campbell was nominated for five Grammy Awards and two American Music Awards.	0

Draper (25 enero 1923 hasta 28 marzo 2003)\,  conocido profesionalmente como Rusty Draper \, era un cantante americano de Pop que logró su mayor éxito en la década de 1950.  Nacido en Kirksville\, Missouri (el apodo de "Rusty" era por su pelo rojo) comenzó a actuar en el programa de radio de su tío en Tulsa \, Oklahoma a mediados de la década de 1930. Draper pasó a trabajar en las estaciones de radio en Des Moines \, Iowa  (veces tomando el lugar del locutor deportivo Ronald Reagan) \, y en Illinois antes de instalarse en California . Allí comenzó a cantar en  clubes \, convirtiéndose en el cantante oficial del casino de San Francisco . A principios de la década de 1950 había empezado a aparecer en programas de televisión nacionales\, incluyendo The Ed Sullivan Show (CBS) y Ozark Jubilee (ABC).  En 1952\, Draper firmó con Mercury Records y lanzó su primera grabación  \, "How Could You (ojos azules)". Al año siguiente\, después de una gira nacional de clubes\, su versión de  Jim Lowe's "Gambler's Guitar" 's llegó al N º 6 en las listas de éxitos de todo el paçis\, y vendió un millón de copias\, consiguiendo  un disco de oro.  Tras una serie de éxitos menores\, volvió a lo más alto en 1955 con "Seventeen" (N º 18)\, "El Shifting\, Whispering Sands" (N º 3) y "Are You Satisfied?" (No. 11)\, convirtiéndose en uno de los cantantes  de pop  con más éxito de la época.  En 1962\, firmó con con Monument Records \, con cada vez menos éxito en las listas ya que su estilo se fue quedando anticuado. Sin embargo\, él continuó teniendo éxitos menores durante la década de 1960.  Apareció en musicales de teatro y en la televisión\,  Draper murió de neumonía \, en Bellevue\, Washington \, a la edad de 80 años.

A vocal version was also released and performed by Melina Mercouri in the film of same name directed by Jules Dassin and starring Mercouri. Written by Hadjidakis\, the song won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1960\, a first for a foreign-language picture. The film score to the movie was first released on October 1\, 1960 by United Artists Records. The song has since been covered by numerous artists\, and has gained various degrees of success throughout the world.  Background  The original Greek version featured lyrics also written by Hadjidakis was performed in the film by Melina Mercouri. The original Greek lyrics (along with the foreign translations in German\, French and Italian) tell the story of the main female character of the film\, Illya (Mercouri). Illya is a jolly woman who enjoys life\, the town and the people of her native Piraeus. Although she earns her money as a prostitute\, she longs to meet a man someday who is just as full of joie de vivre as she is herself.  In 1960\, the song was nominated and won the Academy Award for Best Original Song\, a first for a foreign-language picture since the Academy began to recognize achievements in this category in 1934. An orchestral version recorded by Don Costa reached number 19 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1960\, while it also remained on the chart into 1961. Following the success of the orchestral version as well as the Oscar win\, an English language version of the song was commissioned to be written especially to match the title of the film. The lyrics to the English version of the song were written by Billy Towne. A vocal cover of the song by The Chordettes reached number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1961.  Lale Andersen scored a number one hit in 1960 with the German language version of the song titled "Ein Schiff wird kommen".  In 2010\, a remixed dance version of the song was released by newly formed group Aroma (consisting of Raf Marchesini\, Max B and Ilario Drago) under the title "The Children of Piraeus". English\, Greek\, and French versions of the song were released\, with the English and Greek versions feature vocals by Fame Story 3 contestant Katerina Bourneli\, while the French version features vocals by In-Grid. The song was co-produced by Ego Music Italy and Planetworks Records Greece.  Covers  The song has been covered in a number of languages since its release:  Greek (as Τα Παιδιά του Πειραιά) by Melina Mercouri\, Nana Mouskouri\, Andy Williams\, and Pink Martini. English (as Never on Sunday) by Bing Crosby\, Done Costa\, Lena Horne\, Doris Day\, Andy Williams\, Connie Francis\, Petula Clark\, Lale Andersen\, and The Chordettes.

Cantonese (as 兩爺仔) by Andy Lau\, Anita Mui and Sandra Ng in the film Dance of Dream (愛君如夢). The title song roughly translates "Father and son". Mandarin (as 別在星期天) by Teresa Teng. The title translates as "Never on a Sunday." Polish (as Dzieci Pireusu) by Maria Koterbska and duo of actors Hanna Śleszyńska & Jacek Wójcicki.  Other appearances  The song was used again in the 2005 movie Munich. James Hill\, a Canadian ukulele player\, recorded a version of the song on ukulele for his album A Flying Leap. Nia Vardalos sang a snippet of the Greek version in her 2009 film My Life in Ruins. Los Umbrellos\, a Danish musical group\, used it as a base for their 1998 signature song\, "No Tengo Dinero". This song was sung on the Muppet Show by Miss Piggy and Greek pigs\, complete with smashing plates.	0
COL title VAL Dark Moon COL performer VAL Chet Atkins and Hank Snow	COL video title VAL Charles Hart - Are You Lonesome Tonight - 1927 (Original) COL channel name VAL ElvisKlan COL description VAL Info and label taken from David Neale's websites: http://www.davidneale.eu/elvis/originals/list1.html#S1133 http://davidneale.eu/elvis/labels/after-loving-you---brown/index.html  The number is probably more associated with Al Jolson than anyone other than Elvis\, but Jolson did not make a recording of it until 1950. Numerous artists recorded AYLT in 1927\, including the composer himself\, Lou Handman\, who played piano backing while his sister Edythe provided the vocals on the Gennett label (27 June)\, and Vaughn DeLeath ("The Radio Girl") who recorded the number twice\, first as a solo on 13 June 1927 and then on the following 1 October\, as vocalist for The Colonial Club Orchestra. Famed tenor Henry Burr released his own version in that same year\, having recorded it (probably) on 5 August. Ned Jakobs is often listed as the first to record the number (he recorded it on 17 May 1927)\, but his recording was not used. At least one recording of the number is reported to have been made on 18 June\, 1926\, the year in which it was copyrighted; this was done by Bob Haring\, leading the Cameo Dance Orchestra\, a sort of studio band brought together to record as much as possible as early as possible -- have a look here.. This number was released on three labels: Cameo 967\, Lincoln 2540 and Romeo 250 (all with the same matrix number). However\, the recording is purely instrumental (at least on Romeo 250\, where the performer is listed as the Dixie Daisies) and writing credits are shown for Turk\, Little\, Britt and not Turk\, Handman. It looks\, therefore\, as if Roy Turk's lyrics were set to music twice: the familiar song as Elvis recorded it and an earlier version\, with music by Little and Britt. Therefore\, the original honour has to go to Charles Hart (see good biography)\, whose 9 May 1927 recording was released as "Are You Lonesome To-night" on Harmony 431. Colonel Parker persuaded Elvis to record this number\, a favourite of Mrs. Parker's! The arrangement used in Elvis's version is based on the 1950 recording of Are You Lonesome Tonight by the Blue Barron Orchestra. The spoken part is loosely based on a speech by Jacques in Shakespeare's "As You Like It"\, Act II Scene VII: "All the world's a stage\, and all men and women merely players: they have their exits and their entrances; And one man in his time plays many parts."

COL title VAL When Day Is Done COL performer VAL Harry Archer and His Orchestra	COL video title VAL Les Elgart And His Orchestra -- When Day Is Done COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Les Elgart (3 de agosto\, 1917\, New Haven\, Connecticut - 29 de julio\, 1995\, Dallas\, Texas) fue un director de orquesta de jazz swing y trompetista.  Lester E. (Les) Elgart comenzó a tocar la trompeta cuando era un adolescente\, y con 20 años de edad había ya realizado conciertos profesionales. En la década de 1940 tocó en las bandas dirigidas por Raymond Scott\, Charlie Spivak\, y Harry James\, y de vez en cuando en  bandas junto con el hermano Larry. Juntos crean la suya propia "Les & Larry Elgart Ensemble" en 1945\, y contratan a Nelson Riddle\, Ralph Flanagan\, y Bill Finegan para  hacer arreglos.  La unión fue efímera\, sin embargo\, debido a la huelga de Músicos de la Unión  y la disminución de la popularidad del jazz de Swing\, se separaron en 1946. En 1952\, el dúo se reunió y publicó un número importante de álbumes en Columbia Records\, muchos de considerable éxito de ventas.  Entre sus canciones más conocidas es "Bandstand Boogie"\, que fue utilizado por Dick Clark como la canción de "American Bandstand. Más tarde\, en la década de 1950 Les alejado de los negocios y la manipulación del grupo puso fin a la banda.  Les siguió trabajando hasta su muerte por insuficiencia cardíaca en Dallas\, Texas en 1995.

(Tom Jones Cover) COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven COL description VAL From ''Something Special For The Kids '' Label: Blood Red Vinyl & Discs ‎– BRCD5006 Format: CD\, Album Country: US Released: 1998  Tracklist 01. Beatles Please Come Back (Gigi Parker & the Lonelies) 02. Fire Brigade (The Move) 03. Don't Ever Leave Me (Connie Francis) 04. Gotta Get A Hold Of Myself (The Zombies) 05.

Love In The City (The Turtles) 11. Tallyman (Jeff Beck) 12. Things I'd Like To Say (New Colony Six) 13. I Don't Know Why (Sons of Thunder) 14. Boys Keep Swinging (David Bowie)  After playing mutant swamp-blues-rockabilly guitar with the Gun Club in the early '80s\, Ward Dotson embarked on a less contrived musical course as guitarist\, main writer and de facto leader of the Pontiac Brothers. Dotson subsequently formed the Liquor Giants. "You're Always Welcome" (1992) (aka "America's #1 Recording Artists" in japan) was a dynamic debut. After "Here" (1994) and "Liquor Giants" (1996)\, The Giants were an actual band on "Every Other Day at a Time". Mark McGroarty (bass and vocals) and Mark McNally (guitar and vocals) joined Dotson and Simon for the best album released under the Liquor Giants name. Around the same time\, (actually two of these covers were featured on "Every Other Day at a Time")\, the Giants issued a covers collection\, "Something Special for the Kids"\, with sparkling renditions of classics by Tom Jones\, the Move\, David Bowie and others.  ------------------------  "What's New Pussycat?" is a song written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David for the movie of the same name\, sung by Tom Jones. Nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1966\, it was Jones' third UK top 30 record\, peaking at number 11.  The original single included a 13-second instrumental introduction\, ending in the sound of shattering glass\, but later issues omitted this introduction.  It has also been performed by: Bobby Darin\, Tony Bennett\, Alvin and the Chipmunks\, Anita Kerr\, The Wailers and The Four Seasons. Barbra Streisand performed several lines in her "Color Me Barbra Medley" from the TV special and album Color Me Barbra. The Czech singer Pavel Novák recorded song in 1966 under the title "Žofie".  Cultural references  In The Simpsons episode "Husbands and Knives"\, the character Milo plays a Korean version of "What's New Pussycat?" In another episode "Marge Gets a Job"\, when Marge worked at the nuclear power plant she requested to have Tom Jones music being played there so they played this song.  In an episode of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\, Carlton sings this song when he comes home the next morning after losing his virginity.  In an episode of That 70's Show\, Bob sings this song on the tape recorder for Eric recording incidents while he is in Africa.  In an episode of Living Single\, Kyle sings a few bars of "What's New\, Pussycat?" at a memorial service of a cat killed while Synclaire was pet-sitting.  Ed Begley\, Jr. sings the song to a group of felines at the zoo in the 1982 movie Cat People.  John Mulaney's stand-up routine "The Salt and Pepper Diner" recounts a story where he and a friend purchased 21 consecutive plays of the song on a diner jukebox. The song became viral after being referenced.  The song also appears in the end credits of the computer animated movie Flushed Away.  The song is used as the end credits' theme of the popular 2001 movie Cats & Dogs.  The song is featured twice in the 1998 film Paulie.  Steve Martin sings a line or two in the 1991 film Father of the Bride.  In Turbo\, the song is played on Turbo's music shell.  In 2004\, the song was used in the movie The Life and Death of Peter Sellers during the movies opening credits.  In ADDITION like MAGIC\, the song played in the Wurlitzer Jukebox because Timmy shocked hands with Cosmo.  In Who Is That Blackface?!\, The ringtone was "Ma-a-a-a-agic" by Yea Man Productions and Timmy knew this song from the radio station Wassup from the radio.  ------------------------  What's New Pussycat? is a 1965 comedy film directed by Clive Donner and starring Peter Sellers\, Peter O'Toole\, Romy Schneider\, Capucine\, Paula Prentiss and Ursula Andress. It was Woody Allen's film debut\, as well as his first produced script. The Academy Award-nominated title song by Burt Bacharach (music) and Hal David (lyrics) was sung by Tom Jones. The movie poster was painted by Frank Frazetta.	0

She was also a judge of a Twist contest held at Hartford Armory in East Hartford. Winners were given autographed singles of this record. This song became a hit for Cliff Richard. I have read that Cathy's was the original\, but wasn't released until the movie was already out. Did not chart nationally\, but it did chart locally in the Top 40 in Springfield\, Massachusetts in March 1962\, the Top 50 in San Francisco\, California and the Top 20 in Syracuse\, New York.  Original Billboard review: Four stars. "Attractive tune from the flick of the same name is handed a solid reading by the lass over strong backing by the ork. Ballad has a teen message and side is worth exposure."   Written by Roy Bennett & Sid Tepper.	0

COL title VAL Goodbye COL performer VAL Charlie Haden Quartet West feat. Diana Krall	COL video title VAL Bert Kaempfert - Someday we'll be together COL channel name VAL Socratess2007 COL description VAL Bert Kaempfert re-arranged many "hit songs" of the sixties and seventies for his orchestra.  When hearing such a piece\, you each time discover that "Bert knew his business as no other".  Not only did he each time "stick to his own style" but he also exactly knew how to accentuate certain parts of a song.  This arrangement eg of the famous Supremes hit "Someday we'll be together" contains all the typical Kaempfert ingredients (the Botho Lucas choir softly humming in the background\, the famous "knack-bass" of Ladi Geisler\, the alternating brass) but the title refrain here is being accentuated by the choir actually singing the words (together with trumpets).  True Kaempfert fans will know that this is rather exceptional in Kaempfert recordings\, but we assume Bert - in this case - found it necessary to "make the music complete".  Obviously he also will have been influenced by the "time spirit" of the seventies where "vocal groups" and choirs were becoming more and more popular.  Maybe this does not belong to Bert's "best" work\, but on the whole these "hits à la Kaempfert" remain "standard good quality music" - even up to this day.  From the 1970 album "The Kaempfert Touch" here are Bert Kaempfert and His Orchestra with their interpretation of "Someday we'll be together".  Enjoy ! (And oh yes : feel free to disagree ;-)  that's what the 'comments board' is there for !!)	0

Lester E. (Les) Elgart comenzó a tocar la trompeta cuando era un adolescente\, y con 20 años de edad había ya realizado conciertos profesionales. En la década de 1940 tocó en las bandas dirigidas por Raymond Scott\, Charlie Spivak\, y Harry James\, y de vez en cuando en  bandas junto con el hermano Larry. Juntos crean la suya propia "Les & Larry Elgart Ensemble" en 1945\, y contratan a Nelson Riddle\, Ralph Flanagan\, y Bill Finegan para  hacer arreglos.  La unión fue efímera\, sin embargo\, debido a la huelga de Músicos de la Unión  y la disminución de la popularidad del jazz de Swing\, se separaron en 1946. En 1952\, el dúo se reunió y publicó un número importante de álbumes en Columbia Records\, muchos de considerable éxito de ventas.  Entre sus canciones más conocidas es "Bandstand Boogie"\, que fue utilizado por Dick Clark como la canción de "American Bandstand. Más tarde\, en la década de 1950 Les alejado de los negocios y la manipulación del grupo puso fin a la banda.  Les siguió trabajando hasta su muerte por insuficiencia cardíaca en Dallas\, Texas en 1995.

(Tom Jones Cover) COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven COL description VAL From ''Something Special For The Kids '' Label: Blood Red Vinyl & Discs ‎– BRCD5006 Format: CD\, Album Country: US Released: 1998  Tracklist 01.

Boys Keep Swinging (David Bowie)  After playing mutant swamp-blues-rockabilly guitar with the Gun Club in the early '80s\, Ward Dotson embarked on a less contrived musical course as guitarist\, main writer and de facto leader of the Pontiac Brothers. Dotson subsequently formed the Liquor Giants. "You're Always Welcome" (1992) (aka "America's #1 Recording Artists" in japan) was a dynamic debut. After "Here" (1994) and "Liquor Giants" (1996)\, The Giants were an actual band on "Every Other Day at a Time". Mark McGroarty (bass and vocals) and Mark McNally (guitar and vocals) joined Dotson and Simon for the best album released under the Liquor Giants name. Around the same time\, (actually two of these covers were featured on "Every Other Day at a Time")\, the Giants issued a covers collection\, "Something Special for the Kids"\, with sparkling renditions of classics by Tom Jones\, the Move\, David Bowie and others.  ------------------------  "What's New Pussycat?" is a song written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David for the movie of the same name\, sung by Tom Jones. Nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1966\, it was Jones' third UK top 30 record\, peaking at number 11.

Lester E. (Les) Elgart comenzó a tocar la trompeta cuando era un adolescente\, y con 20 años de edad había ya realizado conciertos profesionales. En la década de 1940 tocó en las bandas dirigidas por Raymond Scott\, Charlie Spivak\, y Harry James\, y de vez en cuando en  bandas junto con el hermano Larry. Juntos crean la suya propia "Les & Larry Elgart Ensemble" en 1945\, y contratan a Nelson Riddle\, Ralph Flanagan\, y Bill Finegan para  hacer arreglos.  La unión fue efímera\, sin embargo\, debido a la huelga de Músicos de la Unión  y la disminución de la popularidad del jazz de Swing\, se separaron en 1946. En 1952\, el dúo se reunió y publicó un número importante de álbumes en Columbia Records\, muchos de considerable éxito de ventas.  Entre sus canciones más conocidas es "Bandstand Boogie"\, que fue utilizado por Dick Clark como la canción de "American Bandstand. Más tarde\, en la década de 1950 Les alejado de los negocios y la manipulación del grupo puso fin a la banda.  Les siguió trabajando hasta su muerte por insuficiencia cardíaca en Dallas\, Texas en 1995.

COL title VAL And I Think of You COL performer VAL Tanita Tikaram	COL video title VAL Torero Band [Tijuana Christmas] Sound of Brass - The Holly & The Ivy [HQ Audio] COL channel name VAL choccystarfish1 COL description VAL Dance to your favourite Carols with the wonderful 'Sound of Brass' !  Oh the memories this provokes!  Hope some others of you had to endure this in your childhood!  [Sleeve notes]  Christmas is the most joyful festival of the Christian year\, when we celebrate at the same time the turning point of winter and the new hope that was brought to men with the birth of Jesus.  Christmas is a time when we make up for the bleakness of the weather outside with the warmth of our spirits and it is no coincidence that the songs which have become particularly associated with Christmas should be carols\, which have always been the most cheerful and often the most secular of Christian songs.  On this record you will find your favourite carols in an unfamiliar guise - we've called the album 'Tijuana Christmas'\, but you will hear the mariachi sound taking on a richer and more varied flavour as the Torero Band bring out the charms of our most beautiful carol tunes in imaginative brand new arrangements.  'The Holly & the Ivy' sets the pace with a bright\, sparkling beat that even adds to the gaiety of one of our oldest and liveliest carols; 'Silent Night' a much more recent and a more devout carol\, is given quite a contrasting treatment\, slow and tender.  'Hark! The Herald Angels Sing' sets off again at a brisk\, bouncy pace - and if you feel like dancing\, why not?  It may come as a surprise to you that our oldest carols used to be dances and that the word itself described a form of circular dance.  In the preface to the Oxford Book of Carols you will find carols described as songs with a religious impulse that are simple\, popular and modern.  You'll never have heard them sounding more joyful\, popular or modern than they do on this exciting and original LP. (Blase Machin)	0

COL title VAL Alone Together COL performer VAL The Ken Peplowski Quintet	COL video title VAL The Tables - See Emily Play (Pink Floyd Cover) COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven COL description VAL From '' See Emily Play / Arnold Layne '' Label: Two Zero Records ‎-- TZR 002 Format: Vinyl\, 7"\, 45 RPM\, EP Country: Norway Released: 2000   Tracklist A Arnold Layne Guitar -- Reg Trademark Organ -- Mirja B See Emily Play Organ -- Reg Trademark  ------------------------  "See Emily Play" is the second single by English psychedelic rock band Pink Floyd. Written by original frontman Syd Barrett and recorded on 23 May 1967\, it featured "The Scarecrow" as its B-side. Though it was initially released as a non-album single\, the song appeared on the US edition of their debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). It later appeared on the compilations Relics (1971)\, Works (1983)\, Shine On (1992)\, Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd (2001)\, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn 40th Anniversary Edition (2007)\, and most recently on A Foot in the Door -- The Best of Pink Floyd (2011). "See Emily Play" is included in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll list and reached #6 in the UK singles chart.  Background  "See Emily Play" is also known as "Games for May"\, after a free concert in which Syd Barrett's Pink Floyd performed. The slide guitar work on the song was done by Barrett using a plastic ruler. The train depicted on the single's sleeve was drawn by him. The song only stayed in the band's setlist for a few months\, and was last played on 25 November 1967 in Blackpool. It was reportedly about a girl named Emily\, whom Barrett claimed he saw while sleeping in the woods after taking a psychedelic drug. He later stated that the story about sleeping in the woods and seeing a girl before him was made up "...all for publicity." According to A Saucerful of Secrets: The Pink Floyd Odyssey\, by Nicholas Schaffner\, Emily is the Honourable Emily Young\, daughter of Wayland Hilton Young\, 2nd Baron Kennet\, and nicknamed "the psychedelic schoolgirl" at the UFO Club. An article in Mojo magazine called "See the Real Emily" supposedly shows a picture of Barrett's Emily.  Recording and release  The details as to the recording remain shrouded in mystery due to the lack of paperwork in the EMI archive. Engineer Jeff Jarrett recalls that "See Emily Play" was recorded in a much longer form which was then edited down for the single release. It was recorded at Sound Techniques studios on 21 May 1967. There was much trickery involved in the recording with backward tapes\, much use of echo and reverb\, and the first piano bridge between the first chorus and second verse was recorded at a slow pace then sped up for the final master. The four-track master tape was wiped or misplaced. It no longer exists and has never been mixed into true stereo; it was reprocessed for fake stereo on the 1971 Relics compilation. The US single (Tower 356) was released by Tower Records three times between July 1967 and late 1968. Each time it failed to duplicate its UK success.  Television performances  Top of the Pops\, BBCTV\, July 1967  Pink Floyd performed the song three times on BBC TV's Top of the Pops. The first performance was on the 6 July 1967 edition\, hosted by Alan Freeman. They returned for the following week's edition\, 13 July\, hosted by DJ Pete Murray. The last appearance was on 27 July 1967.  Other versions  A cover of "See Emily Play" by Canadian group Three to One (aka Okee Pokey Band) is on the 1967 Yorkville album CTV After Four. This version also appears on the psychedelic compilation album Pebbles\, Volume 14.  David Bowie recorded a version of "See Emily Play" for Pin Ups in 1973.  A cover appears as (one of two) B-sides on a 1991 CD single ("I Am Here") from The Grapes of Wrath\, a Canadian jangle-pop group. The same version is available on the 1994 compilation album Seems Like Fate 1984--1992.  All About Eve played the song live c. 1992 and recorded a demo\, which was not released until 2006 as part of the Keepsakes compilation.  The song was covered by Arjen Anthony Lucassen on his 1997 album Strange Hobby and The Changelings on their 2002 album Astronomica.  Judy Dyble\, the original lead singer of Fairport Convention\, recorded a cover of "See Emily Play" in 2004.  A cover of "See Emily Play"\, appears on the 2006 bluegrass album Pickin' on Pink Floyd: A Bluegrass Tribute.  A cover appears on the 2008 album I Know You're Married But I've Got Feelings Too by Martha Wainwright.  A cover of also appears on the 2008 re-release of the album The End Is Begun by the band 3. This is a heavily modified version\, with an added bridge made by rearranging lyrics from the final verse.	0

If we could talk to the animals\, learn their languages\, Maybe Take an animal degree\, I'd study elephant and eagle\, buffalo and beagle\, Alligator\, guinea pig\, and flea!  I would converse in polar bear and python\, And I would curse in fluent kangaroo\, If people ask me "can you speak rhinoceros?" I'd say "of courserous! Can't you?"  If I conferred with our furry friends\, man to animal\, Think of the amazing repartee If I could walk with the animals\, talk with the animals\, Grunt and squeak and squawk with the animals\, And they could squeak and skwawk and speak and talk to us!  If I consult with the quadrupeds Think what fun wed have\, asking for the crocodiles for tea! Or maybe lunch with three lions\, walruses and sea lions What a lovely place the world would be!  If I spoke slang to orangutans The advantages any fool on earth could plainly see! Discussing Eastern art and dramas With intellectual llamas Thats a big step forward youll agree!  Id learn to speak in antelope and turtle And my Pekinese would be extremely good If I were asked to sing in hippopotamus Id say whynotamous? and I would!  If I could parlay with pachyderms Its a fairy tale worthy of Hans Anderson and Grimm A man who walks with the animals and talks with the animals Grunts and squeaks and squawks with the animals and they could talk to *me*!   Id study every *living* creatures language So I could speak to all of them on site If friends said can he talk in crab or pelican? Youd say *like hell he can and you'll be right!  And if you just stop to think of it there's no doubt of it I would win a place in history If I could walk with the animals Talk with the animals Grunt no word here squeak and squawk with the animals And they could squeak and squawk and speak and talk to me!	0

COL title VAL La malaguena COL performer VAL Los Angeles	COL video title VAL Duran Duran - Watching the detectives COL channel name VAL notoriousgit COL description VAL I do not claim any ownership for the song\, or video used in this video...  Song from the Duran Duran Album - Thank You  Video is from Turner classical movies detectives season  slowed down to fit song length  "Watching the Detectives" is a 1977 single by English singer-songwriter Elvis Costello. It was his first single that credited his backing band\, the Attractions\, and gave him his first UK hit single. The song featured on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time at #354.  The song\, with a lyric about a lover who would rather watch TV\, sung over a simple reggae beat\, was described by Rolling Stone as "a clever but furious burst of cynicism"\, and they also described the song as "indisputably classic". All music's Mark Deming described the song: "a skeletal minor-key melody that slowly but effectively wound itself into a solid knot of fierce emotional tension\, pushing the bitter lyrical atmosphere further into the darkness". Costello described how he wrote the song: "I was in my flat in the suburbs of London before I was a professional musician\, and I'd been up for thirty-six hours. I was actually listening to another inductee's record\, the Clash's first album. When I first put it on\, I thought it was just terrible. Then I played it again and I liked it better. By the end\, I stayed up all night listening to it on headphones\, and I thought it was great. Then I wrote "Watching the Detectives" The song was covered by Duran Duran on their 1995 Thank You album.	0

I don't care if there's powder on my nose  I don't care if my hairdo is in place  I've lost the very meaning of repose  I never put a mud pack on my face   Oh\, who'd have thought that I'd walk in a daze  Now I never go to shows at night but just to matinees  Now I see the show and home I go   Once I laughed when I heard you saying  That I'd be playing solitaire  Uneasy in my easy chair  It never entered my mind   Once you told me I was mistaken  That I'd awaken with the sun  And order orange juice for one  It never entered my mind   You have what I lack myself  And now I even have  To scratch my back myself   Once you warned me that if you scorned me  I'd sing the maiden's prayer again  And wish that you were there again  To get into my hair again\, it never entered my mind	0

COL title VAL Silent Night COL performer VAL Jonathan Jones	COL video title VAL Ferrante & Teicher -- Malagueña (Andalucía) COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Ferrante & Teicher eran un dúo de pianistas americanos\, conocidos por sus arreglos de piezas clásicas\, bandas sonoras de películas\, y todo tipo de ritmos. Arthur Ferrante  (7 de septiembre de 1921\, Nueva York - 19 de septiembre de 2009)\, y Louis Teicher (24 de agosto de 1924\, Wilkes-Barre\, Pennsylvania  - 3 de agosto de 2008) se conocieron mientras estudiaban en la Escuela Juilliard de Música de Nueva York. Niños prodigios de la música\, que comenzaron  a actuar como dúo de piano cuando aún estaban en la escuela.  En 1947\, comenzaron a dedicarse por completo al mundo de la música y rápidamente empiezan a ascender  tocando música clásica con respaldo orquestal. Steven Tyler de Aerosmith relata la historia de que en la década de 1950\, los dos estudiantes ensayaban en la casa de su abuela Constanza Neidhart Tallarico.  Entre 1950 y 1980\, fueron un importante dúo de música  easy listening\, consiguiendo  cuatro grandes EE.UU. golpea:  El tema de  "The Apartment" \, el Tema  de "Exodus  \, "Tonight" y "Cowboy de medianoche". Realizaron actuaciones y grabaciones de forma regular con las orquestas de George Gershwin \, Jerome Kern \, Cole Porter \, Richard Rodgers y otros  El dúo también experimentó con pianos preparados\, agregando papel\, palos de goma\, bloques de madera\, barras de metal\, cadenas\, cristales\, mazos y otros objetos que colocaban en las cuerdas del piano. De esta manera fueron capaces de producir una variedad de sonidos extraños que a veces se parecían a los instrumentos de percusión\, y en otras ocasiones sonaban como si se hubieran sintetizado electrónicamente.  Ferrante y Teicher dejaron de actuar en 1989 y se retiraron  a Longboat Key y Siesta Key \, respectivamente\, ambos cerca uno del otro en la costa oeste de Florida. Seguían tocando juntos\, de vez en cuando\, en una tienda local de pianos . Louis Teicher falleció de un ataque al corazón en agosto de 2008\, tres semanas antes de su cumpleaños número 84. Arthur Ferrante falleció de causas naturales el 19 de septiembre de 2009 a la edad de 88 años.  iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/es/album/hi-fiireworks/id837731730  Síguenos en: Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/vintagem.es Spotify: http://open.spotify.com/user/vintagemusic Web: http://www.vintagemusic.es BoutiqAlia: http://boutiqalia.com/store/vintage/ (compra física de CD) Compra nuestros Cd's en formato físico en estas plataformas: Ebay:  http://stores.ebay.com/VintageMusicFm BoutiqAlia: www.boutiqalia-vintagemusic.com Síguenos en: Spotify: https://goo.gl/raouHQ Facebook: https://goo.gl/L92BHL Instagram: https://goo.gl/3oYDGH Web: http://www.vintagemusic.es   Compra nuestros Cd's en formato físico en estas plataformas: Ebay:  http://stores.ebay.com/VintageMusicFm BoutiqAlia: www.boutiqalia-vintagemusic.com Discogs: https://www.discogs.com/es/seller/vintagemusicfm/profile	0

Lester E. (Les) Elgart comenzó a tocar la trompeta cuando era un adolescente\, y con 20 años de edad había ya realizado conciertos profesionales. En la década de 1940 tocó en las bandas dirigidas por Raymond Scott\, Charlie Spivak\, y Harry James\, y de vez en cuando en  bandas junto con el hermano Larry. Juntos crean la suya propia "Les & Larry Elgart Ensemble" en 1945\, y contratan a Nelson Riddle\, Ralph Flanagan\, y Bill Finegan para  hacer arreglos.  La unión fue efímera\, sin embargo\, debido a la huelga de Músicos de la Unión  y la disminución de la popularidad del jazz de Swing\, se separaron en 1946. En 1952\, el dúo se reunió y publicó un número importante de álbumes en Columbia Records\, muchos de considerable éxito de ventas.  Entre sus canciones más conocidas es "Bandstand Boogie"\, que fue utilizado por Dick Clark como la canción de "American Bandstand. Más tarde\, en la década de 1950 Les alejado de los negocios y la manipulación del grupo puso fin a la banda.  Les siguió trabajando hasta su muerte por insuficiencia cardíaca en Dallas\, Texas en 1995.

COL title VAL L'amour nous rend fou COL performer VAL Ronnie Bird	COL video title VAL Marlene Dietrich ft Victor Young's Orchestra - You Go To My Head (Decca Records 1939) COL channel name VAL RoundMidnightTV COL description VAL "You Go to My Head" is a 1938 popular song composed by J. Fred Coots with lyrics by Haven Gillespie. The song is a unique conjunction of a sophisticated lyric and complex\, lush harmonic structure by two songwriters who were not generally known for such elegance; nevertheless the song is highly regarded by jazz musicians and critics alike. The song was first recorded in 1938 by Teddy Wilson with a vocal by Nan Wynn. The same year it was recorded by Billie Holiday. On 23 April 1961\, Judy Garland performed the song at the "Judy at Carnegie Hall" concert.   Marie Magdalene "Marlene" Dietrich (December 27\, 1901 – May 6\,1992) was a German-American actress and singer. Dietrich maintained popularity throughout her unusually long show business career by continually re-inventing herself\, professionally and characteristically. In 1920s Berlin\, she acted on the stage and in silent films. Her performance as Lola-Lola in The Blue Angel (1930)\, directed by Josef von Sternberg\, brought her international fame resulting in a contract with Paramount Pictures. Dietrich starred in Hollywood films such as Morocco (1930)\, Shanghai Express (1932) and Desire (1936). Dietrich successfully traded on her glamorous persona and "exotic" (to Americans) looks\, cementing her super-stardom and becoming one of the highest-paid actresses of the era. Dietrich became a U.S. citizen in 1939\, and throughout the Second World War she was a high-profile frontline entertainer. Although she still made occasional films after the end of the Second World War\, Dietrich spent most of the 1950s to the 1970s touring the world as a marquee live-show performer. Dietrich was noted for her humanitarian efforts during the War\, housing German and French exiles\, providing financial support\, and even advocating for their US citizenship. For her work improving morale on the front lines in WWII\, she received honors from the US\, France\, Belgium\, and Israel. In 1999\, the American Film Institute named Dietrich the ninth-greatest female star of classic Hollywood cinema.  You go to my head And you linger like a haunting refrain And I find you spinning round in my brain Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne  You go to my head Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew And I find the very mention of you Like the kicker in a julep or two  The thrill of the thought That you might give a thought To my plea\, casts a spell over me Still I say to myself Get a hold of yourself Can't you see that this never can be  You go to my head With a smile that makes my temperature rise Like a summer with a thousand July's You intoxicate my soul with your eyes  Though I'm certain that this heart of mine Hasn't a ghost of a chance In this crazy romance You go to my head  You go to my head With a smile that makes my temperature rise Like a summer with a thousand July's You intoxicate my soul with your eyes  Though I'm certain that this heart of mine Hasn't a ghost of a chance In this crazy romance You go to my head You go to my head	0
COL title VAL In a Mellow Tone COL performer VAL Lera Gehner Band	COL video title VAL "What The World Needs Now Is Love" (1968) The Staple Singers COL channel name VAL Gospel Nostalgia COL description VAL This is track 1 from the 1968 album "What The World Needs Now Is Love". Lead by Mavis Staples Written by Hal David and Burt Bacharach The family began appearing in Chicago-area churches in 1948\, and signed their first professional contract in 1952. During their early career they recorded in an acoustic gospel-folk style with various labels: United Records\, Vee-Jay Records(their "Uncloudy Day" and "Will The Circle Be Unbroken" were best sellers)\, Checker Records\, Riverside Records\, and then Epic Records in 1965. While the family surname is "Staples"\, the group used the singular form for its name\, resulting in the group's name being "The Staple Singers".  It was on Epic that the Staple Singers began moving into mainstream pop markets\, with "Why (Am I Treated So Bad)" and "For What It's Worth" (Stephen Stills) in 1967. In 1968\, the Staple Singers signed to Stax Records and released two albums with Steve Cropper and Booker T & the MG's — Soul Folk in Action and We'll Get Over. By 1970\, Al Bell had become producer\, and with Engineer Terry Manning\, the family began recording at the famed Muscle Shoals Sound Studio\, and Memphis' Ardent Studios\, moving in a more funk and soul direction.  The first Stax hit was "Heavy Makes You Happy (Sha-Na-Boom Boom)". Their 1971 recording of "Respect Yourself"\, written by Luther Ingram and Mack Rice\, peaked at #2 on the R&B charts and was a #12 pop hit as well. The song's theme of self-empowerment had universal appeal\, released in the period immediately following the intense American civil rights movement of the 1960s. In 1972\, the group had a huge #1 hit in the United States with "I'll Take You There". It topped both pop and R&B charts. "If You're Ready (Come Go With Me)" would become another big hit\, reaching #9 pop and #1 on the R&B chart in 1973. Then\, after Stax's bankruptcy in 1975\, they signed to Curtis Mayfield's label\, Curtom Records\, and released "Let's Do It Again"\, produced by Mayfield; the song became their second #1 pop hit in the US and the album also. In 1976\, they collaborated with The Band for their film The Last Waltz\, performing on the song "The Weight" (which The Staple Singers had previously covered on their first Stax album). However\, they were not able to regain their momentum\, releasing only occasional minor hits. Their 1984 album Turning Point featured their final Top 40 hit\, a cover of Talking Heads' "Slippery People" (which also reached the Top 5 on the Dance chart). In 1994\, they again performed the song "The Weight" with Country music artist Marty Stuart for MCA Nashville's Rhythm\, Country and Blues compilation\, somewhat re-establishing an audience. The song "Respect Yourself" was used by Spike Lee in the soundtrack to his movie Crooklyn\, made in 1994.  In 1999\, the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Pops Staples died of complications from a concussion suffered in December 2000. In 2005\, the group was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Mavis Staples has continued to carry on the family tradition and continues to add her vocal talents to both the projects of other artists and her own solo ventures. Cleotha Staples died in Chicago on February 21\, 2013\, after suffering from Alzheimer's disease for over a decade.	0

COL title VAL In Love in Vain COL performer VAL Chris Anderson	COL video title VAL DAVID RUFFIN -"RAINY NIGHT IN GEORGIA" (1971) COL channel name VAL MANNY MORA COL description VAL It's well known that Motown recorded more material than it could release\, but its reasons for shelving material remain a mystery to this day. Ever since the CD reissue boom of the late '80s\, this unreleased material has begun to trickle out of the vaults\, and when it does surface in such forms as the dynamite double-disc set A Cellarful of Motown!\, the music is so good it's hard to believe that it never was released at the time. Knowing this\, it should not come as a complete surprise that former Temptations lead singer David Ruffin had a full\, completed album shelved in 1971\, but hearing Hip-O Select's excavation of that album on the 2004 release David: The Unreleased Album\, it's still a wonder that this record sat in the vaults for over three decades\, with very few of the songs recorded during the sessions appearing on other records and compilations over the years. Far from being unreleasable\, David (titled as such because the album was never given a proper title -- it was given a catalog number and track sequencing\, with David Ruffin penciled in as its name\, but that was used as the title for his 1973 album) finds Ruffin at a solo peak\, not just a singer but in terms of material. He cut the 12 songs that comprised the album\, along with the seven bonus tracks from the same sessions that fill out this CD reissue\, in late 1969 and 1970\, after he had a big solo hit with "My Whole World Ended (The Moment You Left Me)\," with the intent of releasing the album in 1971. There were a pair of covers of recent hits -- an appropriately heartbroken and seductive "Rainy Night in Georgia" and a rather revelatory "I Want You Back\," which added real grit to the Jackson 5's effervescent smash -- but most of this was material written for Ruffin and it played to his strengths. While this music was rooted in Motown's signature sound and performed by the Funk Brothers\, it also looked beyond Detroit\, adding heavy doses of funk\, psychedelia\, and smooth soul\, filled with galvanizing horns\, driving guitars\, down-n-dirty clavinets\, flourishes of electric sitar\, fuzz tones\, and wah-wah guitars\, all grounded by Ruffin's earthy testifying and tied together by top-notch songwriting. All these elements wound up sounding much hipper than much of the music officially released by Motown in the early 1970\, when Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye were just beginning to break free of the studio's formula\, and while David and its accompanying bonus tracks are not a masterpiece along the lines of Talking Book or What's Going On (or even Where I'm Coming From\, for that matter)\, it's vibrant\, exciting music that still sounds fresh -- arguably fresher than full-length Temptations albums of the late '60s -- which qualifies it as a lost classic of sorts. Why was it lost\, consigned to the vaults for nearly three and a half decades? According to the liner notes\, nobody really knows. Ruffin wasn't popular among the executives at Motown in the early '70s\, and he was also going through a number of well-documented personal problems\, so it's possible that Motown simply didn't want to promote him at the time\, but it's also true that the label had a number of great records\, including Marvin's What's Going On\, to release in 1971\, and Ruffin had two LPs out in 1970\, including a duet album with his brother Jimmy\, so the market may have been saturated. We'll likely never know the reason why David was buried\, but fortunately it has been unearthed\, and it's a reason for hardcore soul and Motown fans to celebrate.	0
COL title VAL Sitting on Top of the World COL performer VAL Alex Belhaj's Crescent City Quartet	COL video title VAL Ana Popovic - Sitting on the Top of the World\, Bamberg\, Germany\, 12. Aug. 2011 COL channel name VAL frizzknottek COL description VAL Ana Popovic (Serbia) and Band (Holland); Ronald Jacob Jonker (bass\, vocals)\, Stephane Avellaneda (drums)\, Michele Papadia (keyboard\, piano) (http://www.anapopovic.com/)  The numerous versions of "Sitting Top of the World" recorded since 1930 have been characterized by variations to the original lyrics\, as recorded by the Mississippi Sheiks in 1930.  "Sittin' on Top of the World"\, recorded by Howlin' Wolf in 1957 (and published under his birth-name Chester Burnett)\, is a well-known and widely-used version of this song. This was the version recorded by Cream in 1968. Howlin' Wolf shortened the song to just three verses. The first and third verses are similar to the second and fifth verses of the Mississippi Sheiks' song. The middle verse of Howlin' Wolf's version -- "Worked all the summer\, worked all the fall / Had to take Christmas\, in my overalls" -- was an addition to the 1930 original\, but had previously appeared in a version recorded by Ray Charles in 1949.

In 1945 lyrics were added by Singer-Composer- Lyricist\,  Johnny Mercer\, and was recorded in February of the same year by Woody Herman on the Columbia Records label. The film was based on a 1942 novel written by Vera Caspary\, also titled " LAURA " .  It should be noted that when Johnny Mercer wrote the lyrics to David Raksin's melody\, he had never watched the film that the melody was used in and yet\, his lyrics captured the feeling & tone of the film almost completely.

Well\, if you're a Roy Drusky fan\, probably so. If you asked me if the album works as a whole\, I'd say no. Roy's still at the top of his game in the later stages of his career\, but most of these pop tunes just don't translate well to a country setting (like The Beatles' "Yesterday"\, which DOES NOT work as a country tune so stop trying\, dammit!). This cover of the #4 1964 Gerry And The Pacemakers hit isn't too bad\, so it's worth a listen.	0

Song from the Duran Duran Album - Thank You  Video is from Turner classical movies detectives season  slowed down to fit song length  "Watching the Detectives" is a 1977 single by English singer-songwriter Elvis Costello. It was his first single that credited his backing band\, the Attractions\, and gave him his first UK hit single. The song featured on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time at #354.  The song\, with a lyric about a lover who would rather watch TV\, sung over a simple reggae beat\, was described by Rolling Stone as "a clever but furious burst of cynicism"\, and they also described the song as "indisputably classic". All music's Mark Deming described the song: "a skeletal minor-key melody that slowly but effectively wound itself into a solid knot of fierce emotional tension\, pushing the bitter lyrical atmosphere further into the darkness". Costello described how he wrote the song: "I was in my flat in the suburbs of London before I was a professional musician\, and I'd been up for thirty-six hours. I was actually listening to another inductee's record\, the Clash's first album. When I first put it on\, I thought it was just terrible. Then I played it again and I liked it better. By the end\, I stayed up all night listening to it on headphones\, and I thought it was great. Then I wrote "Watching the Detectives" The song was covered by Duran Duran on their 1995 Thank You album.	0

Randazzo\, a childhood friend of the group\, wrote the song especially for them\, having also supplied the group with their previous Top 20 Hit "I'm on the Outside (Looking In)". Their original version of the song was a Billboard Top 10 Pop hit\, reaching #6 on the Billboard Hot 100\, and #1 in the Canadian RPM-list in 1965. The song peaked at #8 on Cashbox magazine's R&B chart (Billboard was in a chart recess for R&B listings at that time). The Little Anthony & the Imperials original recording is the most commonly known version of the song\, and the definitive version\, although it's since been covered by many other artists.

COL title VAL Hey Jude COL performer VAL King Curtis	COL video title VAL Giant Steps COL channel name VAL Jazzman 2696 COL description VAL "Giant Steps" is a jazz recording by John Coltrane\, on tenor saxophone\, which is the first track on the album of the same name and is 4 minutes and 49 seconds long. The composition is a milestone for jazz musicians' progress\, given the difficulty of improvising its rapid progression of chord changes that progress through three keys (see Coltrane changes) shifted by major thirds\, creating an augmented triad.  The saxophonist had previously used this technique on the LP Blue Train on the tunes Moment's Notice and Lazy Bird. Coltrane continued in this vein on a recording with Cannonball Adderley of the standard "Limehouse Blues\," and on his original "Fifth House." He continued to use this approach on other tunes\, such as "Countdown"\, based on the Miles Davis tune "Tune Up"; "26 2" based on Charlie Parker's "Confirmation"; and a reharmonization of the jazz standard "Body and Soul." Songs such as "Naima" and "Like Sonny" also show some harmonic similarity to "Giant Steps." Coltrane continued to employ similar concepts in his soloing during his more open and modal middle period. A Love Supreme features examples of lines based on "Giant Steps" cycles over modal vamps\, to create a Polytonal effect (see modal jazz).  The progression continues to stimulate harmonic thinking in contemporary jazz. There are a number of different approaches to soloing on the song. While Coltrane favoured arpeggiation over the changes\, other players have used different tricks and patterns to bring out the sound of the changes. The chord progression was later used by Freddie Hubbard as a basis for his composition "Dear John" (on Hubbard's 1991 album Bolivia). Covers have been recorded by such artists as Rahsaan Roland Kirk\, Pat Metheny\, Buddy Rich\, Jaco Pastorius\, Mike Stern\, Greg Howe\, Tommy Flanagan (who played on the original recording)\, McCoy Tyner\, Kenny Werner\, Kenny Garrett\, Woody Herman\, and Taylor Eigsti\, Gary Bartz. The song was recorded by Chaka Khan in 1982 as part of the "Be Bop Medley" from her album "Chaka Khan".  John Coltrane was known for coming into the studio with unrehearsed songs - "Giant Steps" was no exception. On the original recording\, Tommy Flanagan (piano) played a choppy start-stop solo where it sounds like he is struggling to improvise over Coltrane changes without adequate preparation. Flanagan would revisit Giant Steps on several recordings later in his career and mastered the progression. In some of the alternate takes\, Cedar Walton is at the piano\, declining to take a solo and also playing at a slower tempo than the takes with Flanagan.	0

Considerati dei ragazzini prodigio\, iniziarono la loro attività concertistica giovanissimi. Prima ancora di ottenere la laurea iniziarono l'attività in duo che portarono avanti assieme per tutta la loro vita. Nel 1947 intrapresero una carriera concertistica a tempo pieno\, prima nei night club\, poi in esibizioni di musica classica con orchestra al seguito. Tra il 1950 e il 1980 furono tra i principali artisti easy listening d'America e ottennero numerosi successi discografici. Fra i loro maggiori successi si possono citare: "Theme From The Apartment"\, "Exodus"\, "Tonight" e "Midnight Cowboy". Essi realizzarono frequenti registrazioni con le maggiori orchestre pop tra le quali si ricordano quelle dirette da George Gershwin\, Jerome Kern\, Cole Porter\, Richard Rodgers ed altre ancora.   ------------------------------------------------------------ Ferrante & Teicher was een Amerikaans pianoduo . Zij waren vooral bekend om hun arrangement van bekende klassieke en filmmuziek.  Arthur Ferrante (New York City\, 7 september - 1921 - 19 september 2009) en Louis Teicher (Wilkes Barre\, 24 augustus 1924 - 3 augustus 2008) leerden elkaar kennen toen zij studeerden aan de "Juilliard School" voor muziek in New York. Beiden waren muzikaal zeer begaafd en begonnen als pianoduo op te treden\, toen ze nog op school zaten. Na hun afstuderen gingen beiden aan de slag aan de Juilliard-faculteit.  In 1947 begonnen zij een voltijdse concertcarrière. Ze speelden eerst in nachtclubs\, maar schakelden al snel over naar het spelen van klassieke muziek met orkestbegeleiding. Tussen 1950 en 1980 waren zij een der belangrijkste Amerikaanse "easy listening"-groepen en scoorden zij vier grote hits: "Theme From The Apartment" (Pop #10)\, "Exodus" (Pop #2)\, "Tonight" (Pop #8)\, and "Midnight Cowboy" (Pop #10). Zij traden op en namen platen op met nummers van George Gershwin\, Jerome Kern\, Cole Porter en Richard Rodgers. In 1973 speelden zij het openingsnummer van het radiodrama The Zero Hour van Rod Sterling. Het duo deed ook aan "avant garde".	0

COL title VAL Don't You Want Me COL performer VAL Glee Cast	COL video title VAL Seventy Six Trombones - Henry Mancini and His Orchestra COL channel name VAL Lloyd T. COL description VAL Seventy-six Trombones is the signature song from the musical play The Music Man (1957)\, which was written by Meredith Willson. This song also appeared in the film The Music Man (1962)\, and in the made-for-TV movie adaptation in 2003. It is also a piece commonly played by marching and military bands. Seventy-six trombones led the big parade With a hundred and ten cornets close at hand ... In one of Willson's arrangements of the song\, it seamlessly integrates with other popular marches at the time\, such as Stars and Stripes Forever and The Washington Post March by John Philip Sousa (in whose band Willson had played)\, the The National Emblem March by Edwin Eugene Bagley\, the Swedish song Under the Blue and Yellow Flag by Viktor Widqvist\, and the song the Second Regiment\, Connecticut National Guard by D.W. Reeves. In the dramas\, "Professor" Harold Hill uses the song Seventy-six trombones to help the townspeople of the fictional town of River City\, Iowa\, visualize their children playing in a marching band by harkening back to a time when he saw several famous bandleaders' bands in a combined performance. Whereas an average-sized high school marching band might have about 10 musicians playing the trombone\, and a large college marching band seldom has more than 30 trombonists\, the band that Harold describes to the villagers included 76 trombones\, 110 cornets\, "over a thousand reeds"\, double bell euphoniums\, and "fifty mounted cannon" (which were popular in bands of the time). The love ballad Goodnight\, My Someone\, which immediately precedes Seventy-six Trombones in the musicals\, has the same tune but it is played in 3/4 metre - with a much slower tempo. In Willson's hometown of Mason City\, Iowa\, they honor this song (and the rest of the story of The Music Man) in a building called "Music Man Square"\, which is located next to Willson's boyhood home. In one large room\, they have 76 donated trombones hanging from the ceiling.	0

( Famous Blue Raincoat ) COL channel name VAL Sirens Meadow COL description VAL Album  " Hadde månen en søster: Cohen på norsk " \, ( 1993 )  Det er fire om morgenen\, det er sent i desember. Jeg skriver for å spørre deg hvordan du har det. Det er vinter i Oslo\, men for meg er det stedet. Det er musikk fra kaféen i Pilestredet. Jeg har hørt at du flyttet til en øy ute ved kysten. Kan du leve for ingenting nå? Syns du skal føre et slags regnskap.  Og han var her med en lokk av ditt hår. Han sa han fikk den den natten i vår\, da du trodde du skulle gå fri. Har du noen gang gått fri?  Du så mye eldre ut sist gang vi så deg. Du kledde ikke klærne du hadde tatt på deg. Du sto på perrongen -- der hver møtte sin\, men du gikk alltid hjemover uten James Dean. Så tok du min elsker\, du tok ham for gitt. Og da han kom hjem\, var hans liv ikke mitt.  Å\, jeg ser deg der\, med en rose i munnen. Ei sigøynerske gjorde et funn. Vel\, jeg ser han er våken her nå. Han ber meg å hilse.  Hva kan jeg få sagt deg\, min søster\, min morderske? Hva kan jeg si deg med ord? Jeg tror nok jeg savner deg\, tror nok jeg tilgir deg\, glad at du gjorde det du gjorde. Om du kommer tilbake\, om du kommer forbi: Din fiende sover nå\, og mannen hennes er fri.  Og takk for det mørket du tok fra hans blikk. Det har jeg aldri forsøkt. Jeg trodde ikke det gikk.  Og han var her med en lokk av ditt hår. Han sa han fikk den den natten i vår\, da du trodde du skulle gå fri.  Med hilsen din venn  Original : Leonard Cohen  It's four in the morning\, the end of December I'm writing you now just to see if you're better New York is cold\, but I like where I'm living There's music on Clinton Street  all through the evening.  I hear that you're building  your little house deep in the desert You're living for nothing now\,  I hope you're keeping some kind of record.  Yes\, and Jane came by with a lock of your hair She said that you gave it to her That night that you planned to go clear Did you ever go clear?  Ah\, the last time we saw you  you looked so much older Your famous blue raincoat  was torn at the shoulder You'd been to the station  to meet every train And you came home without Lili Marlene  And you treated my woman  to a flake of your life And when she came back  she was nobody's wife.  Well I see you there with  the rose in your teeth One more thin gypsy thief Well I see Jane's awake -- She sends her regards.  And what can I tell you  my brother\, my killer What can I possibly say? I guess that I miss you\,  I guess I forgive you I'm glad you stood in my way.  If you ever come by here\, for Jane or for me Your enemy is sleeping\, and his woman is free.  Yes\, and thanks\, for the trouble  you took from her eyes I thought it was there for good  so I never tried.  And Jane came by with a lock of your hair She said that you gave it to her That night that you planned to go clear  -- Sincerely\, L. Cohen	0

Lester E. (Les) Elgart comenzó a tocar la trompeta cuando era un adolescente\, y con 20 años de edad había ya realizado conciertos profesionales. En la década de 1940 tocó en las bandas dirigidas por Raymond Scott\, Charlie Spivak\, y Harry James\, y de vez en cuando en  bandas junto con el hermano Larry. Juntos crean la suya propia "Les & Larry Elgart Ensemble" en 1945\, y contratan a Nelson Riddle\, Ralph Flanagan\, y Bill Finegan para  hacer arreglos.  La unión fue efímera\, sin embargo\, debido a la huelga de Músicos de la Unión  y la disminución de la popularidad del jazz de Swing\, se separaron en 1946. En 1952\, el dúo se reunió y publicó un número importante de álbumes en Columbia Records\, muchos de considerable éxito de ventas.  Entre sus canciones más conocidas es "Bandstand Boogie"\, que fue utilizado por Dick Clark como la canción de "American Bandstand. Más tarde\, en la década de 1950 Les alejado de los negocios y la manipulación del grupo puso fin a la banda.  Les siguió trabajando hasta su muerte por insuficiencia cardíaca en Dallas\, Texas en 1995.

COL title VAL La paloma (Duvan) COL performer VAL Bertil Boo	COL video title VAL Joan Baez - And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda COL channel name VAL Spadecaller COL description VAL (See Lyrics below.) A song about a young Australian soldier maimed during the Battle of Gallipoli (1915) during the First World War; written by Eric Bogle in 1972. The paintings of Degas\, Sargent\, and the visual arts of Spadecaller\, augment the song's theme.   LYRICS:  Now when I was a young lad I carried me pack And I lived the free life of the rover. From the Murray's green banks\, to the dusty outback While I waltzed my Matilda all over. Then in 1915\, my country said\, 'Son\, It's time you stop ramblin'\, there's work to be done.' So they gave me a tin hat\, and they gave me a gun\, And they marched me away to the war.  And the band played 'Waltzing Matilda\,' As the ship pulled away from the quay\, Amidst the songs and the cheers\, the flag waving\, and tears\, We sailed off for Gallipoli.  And how well I remember that terrible day\, How our blood stained the sand we call Suvla Bay We were butchered like lambs at the slaughter.  The big Turkish shell caught me arse over head\, And when I woke up in my hospital bed And saw what it had done\, well\, I wished I was dead Never knew there was worse things than dying.  So I'll go no more 'Waltzing Matilda\,' or through the green bush bars and wide For to hunt and tent peg a man needs both legs\, No more 'Waltzing Matilda' for me.  They gathered the injured\, the wounded\, the maimed\, And they shipped us all back to Australia. The armless\, the legless\, the blind\, the insane\, Those proud wounded heroes of Suvla.  And as our ship sailed into Circular Quay\, I looked at the place where me legs used to be\, And thanked Christ there was nobody waiting for me\, To mourn\, and to grieve\, and to pity.  And the band played "Waltzing Matilda" As they wheeled us down the gangway. And nobody cheered\, they just stood and stared. And they all turned their faces away.  And the band still plays 'Waltzing Matilda\,' And the young men still answer the call\, But as year follows year\, those old men disappear Someday\, no one will march there at all.   Waltzing Mathilda\, Waltzing Mathilda Who'll come a-waltzing Mathilda with me And their ghosts may be heard as you pass the Billabong Who'll come a-waltzing Mathilda with me ?	0

COL title VAL When You Walk in the Room COL performer VAL Pam Tillis	COL video title VAL Nat King Cole - Wouldn't It Be Loverly COL channel name VAL uschisfly COL description VAL "...I started out to become a jazz pianist; in the meantime I started singing and I sang the way I felt and that's just the way it came out."  Nathaniel Adams Coles (March 17\, 1919 -- February 15\, 1965)\, known professionally as Nat King Cole\, was an American musician who first came to prominence as a leading jazz pianist. He owes most of his popular musical fame to his soft baritone voice\, which he used to perform in big band and jazz genres. He was one of the first black Americans to host a television variety show\, and has maintained worldwide popularity since his death.  Cole was a smoker of Kool menthol cigarettes\, believing that smoking up to three packs a day gave his voice its rich sound (Cole would smoke several cigarettes in rapid succession before a recording). He died from lung cancer on February 15\, 1965\, at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica\, California.  One of the last albums Nat recorded prior to his death was a collection of songs from Lerner & Lowe's "My Fair Lady" as a tribute to the enthusiasm his fans showed whenever he toured England. "Wouldn't It Be Loverly" was recorded on Sep\, 17\, 1963.  Lyrics: All I want is a room somewhere Far away from the cold night air With one enormous chair Oh\, wouldn't it be loverly?  Lots of chocolate for me to eat Lots of coal makin' lots of heat Warm face\, warm hands\, warm feet Oh\, wouldn't it be loverly?  Oh so loverly sittin' abso-bloomin'-lutely still I would never budge till Spring crept over mi window sill  Someone's head restin' on my knee Warm and tender as he can be Who takes good care of me Oh\, wouldn't it be loverly?  Oh so loverly sittin' abso-bloomin'-lutely still I would never budge till Spring crept over mi window sill  Someone's head restin' on my knee Warm and tender as he can be Who takes good care of me Oh\, wouldn't it be loverly?

COL title VAL The Memphis Blues COL performer VAL Lee Wiley with Billy Butterfield and His Orchestra	COL video title VAL W.C.

Recorded by Victor Military Band\, July 15\, 1914.  Hope you all enjoy!  A bit of info:  In 1909 Handy and his band moved to Memphis\, Tennessee\, where they started playing at clubs on Beale Street. The genesis of his "Memphis Blues" was as a campaign tune written for Edward Crump\, a successful Memphis mayoral candidate in 1909. Handy later rewrote the tune and changed its name from "Mr. Crump" to "Memphis Blues."	1
COL title VAL And the Band Played Waltzing Mathilda COL performer VAL Joan Baez	COL video title VAL The Kirby Stone Four (1958) - Baubles\, Bangles And Beads COL channel name VAL NBCRecords COL description VAL Born in New York City on April 27\, 1918\, Kirby (whose real name was Herbert)\, formed Herby Stone And His Pebbles shortly after the end of WWII\, which by 1947 had evolved into The Kirby Stone Quintette (later shortened to Quintet). The line-up consisted of Kirby (trumpet)\, Art Cow Eyes Engler (saxophone)\, Michael Gardner (piano)\, Bernie Doc Mandel (bass) and Gene Thaler (later replaced by Eddie Hall) (drums). Within a few short years\, the group had become a four piece featuring Kirby\, Michael\, Eddie and first rate impressionist Larry Foster. The Quintet had become a Quartet and then simply a Four\, and it was with this line-up that Kirby found his greatest success\, including a Grammy nomination in 1958 for the song Baubles\, Bangles And Beads (taken from Kismet).   Although the group re-recorded the song in 1964\, and again in 1968\, it is the 1958 version\, issued on the Columbia label\, that shows the group at its peak (and is regarded by many as the ultimate version of this Wright & Forrest classic).   As well as recording\, The Kirby Stone Four appeared on television and in nightclubs across the USA (including their own Kirby Stone Fourum club in New York City)\, and toured overseas.  In the latter half of the 1960s\, Larry left the group to once more pursue a solo career as an impressionist\, and he was replaced by Jimmy Hassell. However\, this line-up was fairly short-lived\, and by the end of the decade the Kirby Stone Four had disbanded. Kirby\, however\, continued touring and recording into the 1970s\, with Kirby Stone & The Ethnic Family and The Kirby Stone Company. He passed away on July 13\, 1981\, aged 63.  This clip features a chronological history of Kirby\, the groups he led\, and the recordings he made. Enjoy!	0

Official music video for the remake of "Cool Jerk" (here cleverly retitled "Cool Jerk '90") that was recorded for the Go-Go's 1990 Greatest Hits album (cleverly title 'Greatest').  The track was produced by frequent Prince collaborator David Z. who was fresh off having a U.S. number one hit with the Fine Young Cannibals "She Drives Me Crazy"\, however the producer's signature drum snare loop sound and highly produced style didn't really mesh well with the organic pop/rock sound the Go-Go's were known for and the single tanked upon release in the Fall of 1990.   Today\, the track is often looked at with much disdain by many Go-Go's fans (and most likely) some band members themselves. However\, the video is a treat in many ways...it does have a colorful\, slick feel to it that pops out at you\, and it IS entertaining to see some of the awkward dance moves the poor band members were forced to endure. While singer Belinda Carlisle seems most comfortable with this task\, poor Gina Schock is forced to dance the cool jerk AND bang the drum at the same time..and the result is pure entertainment GOLD.   Fun fact: The video version of this song is actually a 'remix' of the remixed/remade Cool Jerk ('90) that appears on the album 'Greatest'.	0

COL title VAL I Like Chopin COL performer VAL Gazebo	COL video title VAL Autumn In New York By Arthur Prysock COL channel name VAL texpaco COL description VAL This man absolutely owns this song !  Arthur Prysock was an American jazz singer best known for his live shows and his deep soulful baritone voice.  He has often been characterized as a deep-voiced Billy Eckstine\, and his singing style was very similar.  He joined bandleader Buddy Johnson as a vocalist in 1944 and became a mainstay of the live performance circuits.  He sang on several of Johnson's hits including "Jet My Love"\, "I Wonder Where Our Love Has Gone"\, and "Because".  He gained much attention for his tender\, soulful singing on a beer commercial\, "Tonight\, tonight\, let it be Löwenbräu."  He had a surprise disco hit with "When Love Is New" in 1977\, and much of his older recordings regained attention.  He received a Pioneer Award from the Rhythm and Blues Foundation in 1995.  This selection is from his album "Morning\, Noon And Night—The Collection".	0

COL title VAL Ela é Carioca COL performer VAL Quarteto Jobim-Morelenbaum	COL video title VAL gretchen parlato - ela é carioca @ musig-im-ochsen\, muri COL channel name VAL Stephan Diethelm COL description VAL Gretchen Parlato ist der neue Stern am Himmel des weiblichen Vocal-Jazz. Unterstützt durch das Thelonious Monk Institute und begleitet von einem innovativen und erstklassigen Quartett überzeugt sie nicht nur Kritiker und Medien auf ihrem Heimatkontinent\, sondern macht auch international - ausgesprochen gut - von sich reden.   Gretchen's Stimme ist ihr Hauptinstrument. Sie ist sprichwörtlich wie ein Bambusbaum: sehr biegsam\, aber nicht zerbrechlich. Elegant und grazil überschreitet ihre Stimme alle Grenzen\, denn sie hat sich die Musik verschiedener Kulturen zu eigen gemacht. Ihre Stimme ist ein natürliches Instrument\, was sie bereits früh zu nutzen weiß. Dies beweisen einige Clips auf ihrem neuen Album\, die aufgenommen wurden\, als Gretchen gerade einmal zwei Jahre alt war! So wundert es nicht\, dass die amerikanische Jazz-Legende Wayne Shorter Gretchen Parlato als Vokal-Künstlerin vom Format Frank Sinatras beschreibt\, „weil er und sie als Einzige tatsächlich mit dem Instrument Stimme umgehen können."   Das klingt doch sympathisch! Gretchen Parlato gelingt die ideale Balance zwischen Präzision und Improvisation\, sie ist nicht vorhersehbar und verwischt die Grenzen zwischen Sänger und Musiker\, wenn sie beispielsweise eine Textzeile oder wortlose Improvisationen an unbekannte Orte trägt...   Vier Jahre nach Erscheinen ihres Debutalbums begibt sich In a Dream (2009\, Obliqsound/Soulfood) auf eine spannende Reise\, die sowohl zu Parlatos Eigenkompositionen führt\, als auch zurück zu den Helden ihrer Jugend\, wie Stevie Wonder\, Duke Ellington\, Herbie Hancock oder Wayne Shorter. Begleitet wird sie von einer beeindruckenden Zusammenstellung von erstklassigen Musikern: Lionel Loueke an der Gitarre\, Aaron Parks am Klavier\, Derrick Hodge am elektrischen Bass sowie dem Schlagzeuger Kendrick Scott.   Michele Locatelli\, der Produzent des Albums und Mitbegründer von ObliqSound\, bestätigt\, dass Parlatos Wunsch eine großen Bogen musikalischer Einflüsse abzubilden\, ihren wachen Geist und Ihre breite musikalische Sozialisation "verraten" und daher unbedingt unterstützt werden müssen. Er sagt: "Even though her means of expression is jazz-based\, it goes beyond that.

COL title VAL Mother's Little Helper COL performer VAL Mary Coughlan	COL video title VAL Dr. John: Dippermouth Blues (featuring James “12” Andrews) COL channel name VAL Concord Records COL description VAL Amazon: http://smarturl.it/SpiritSatchCD  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee and six-time GRAMMY®-winner Dr. John is New Orleans' most prominent living musical icon. The embodiment of his hometown's freewheeling creative spirit and multiple musical traditions\, he's built a visionary\, idiosyncratic body of work that's deeply rooted in the Crescent City's myriad blues\, R&B\, jazz and rock 'n' roll traditions. So it's fitting that Dr. John's August 19\, 2014 release on Concord Records\, Ske-Dat-De-Dat...The Spirit Of Satch\, pays heartfelt tribute to another larger-than-life New Orleans legend: the seminal trumpeter and vocalist Louis "Satchmo" Armstrong\, whose musical innovations created the template for 20th-century jazz\, and whose playful attitude and life-embracing spirit made him a beloved figure whose worldwide appeal transcended music. "He's the most famous guy that ever came out of my neighborhood\," notes Dr. John. "He became a legend all over\, for his trumpet playin' and everything else\, and he was the United States' ambassador to the world."  Ske-Dat-De-Dat...The Spirit Of Satch honors Armstrong's musical genius as well as his effervescent personality with 13 quintessential numbers drawn from various phases of Armstrong's five-decade career\, with Dr. John joined by a stellar supporting cast that manages to update the material while maintaining the music's timeless emotional appeal. In addition to Dr. John's trademark vocals and piano\, and backup from some of New Orleans' finest musicians\, Ske-Dat-De-Dat…The Spirit Of Satch features a stellar assortment of guest singers and players. Bonnie Raitt shares the spotlight on a swinging reading of "I've Got the World on a String\," Ledisi and the McCrary Sisters lend gospel authority to "Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen\," Anthony Hamilton is featured on a mournful "Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child\," Shemekia Copeland trades verses with Dr. John on a playful reworking on "Sweet Hunk O' Trash\," and the Blind Boys of Alabama lend their powerful voices to "What a Wonderful World" and "Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams."   -uploaded in HD at http://www.TunesToTube.com	0

A vocal version was also released and performed by Melina Mercouri in the film of same name directed by Jules Dassin and starring Mercouri. Written by Hadjidakis\, the song won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1960\, a first for a foreign-language picture. The film score to the movie was first released on October 1\, 1960 by United Artists Records. The song has since been covered by numerous artists\, and has gained various degrees of success throughout the world.  Background  The original Greek version featured lyrics also written by Hadjidakis was performed in the film by Melina Mercouri. The original Greek lyrics (along with the foreign translations in German\, French and Italian) tell the story of the main female character of the film\, Illya (Mercouri). Illya is a jolly woman who enjoys life\, the town and the people of her native Piraeus. Although she earns her money as a prostitute\, she longs to meet a man someday who is just as full of joie de vivre as she is herself.  In 1960\, the song was nominated and won the Academy Award for Best Original Song\, a first for a foreign-language picture since the Academy began to recognize achievements in this category in 1934. An orchestral version recorded by Don Costa reached number 19 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1960\, while it also remained on the chart into 1961. Following the success of the orchestral version as well as the Oscar win\, an English language version of the song was commissioned to be written especially to match the title of the film. The lyrics to the English version of the song were written by Billy Towne. A vocal cover of the song by The Chordettes reached number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1961.  Lale Andersen scored a number one hit in 1960 with the German language version of the song titled "Ein Schiff wird kommen".  In 2010\, a remixed dance version of the song was released by newly formed group Aroma (consisting of Raf Marchesini\, Max B and Ilario Drago) under the title "The Children of Piraeus". English\, Greek\, and French versions of the song were released\, with the English and Greek versions feature vocals by Fame Story 3 contestant Katerina Bourneli\, while the French version features vocals by In-Grid. The song was co-produced by Ego Music Italy and Planetworks Records Greece.  Covers  The song has been covered in a number of languages since its release:  Greek (as Τα Παιδιά του Πειραιά) by Melina Mercouri\, Nana Mouskouri\, Andy Williams\, and Pink Martini. English (as Never on Sunday) by Bing Crosby\, Done Costa\, Lena Horne\, Doris Day\, Andy Williams\, Connie Francis\, Petula Clark\, Lale Andersen\, and The Chordettes.

COL title VAL Time After Time COL performer VAL Miles Davis	COL video title VAL Giant Steps COL channel name VAL Jazzman 2696 COL description VAL "Giant Steps" is a jazz recording by John Coltrane\, on tenor saxophone\, which is the first track on the album of the same name and is 4 minutes and 49 seconds long. The composition is a milestone for jazz musicians' progress\, given the difficulty of improvising its rapid progression of chord changes that progress through three keys (see Coltrane changes) shifted by major thirds\, creating an augmented triad.  The saxophonist had previously used this technique on the LP Blue Train on the tunes Moment's Notice and Lazy Bird. Coltrane continued in this vein on a recording with Cannonball Adderley of the standard "Limehouse Blues\," and on his original "Fifth House." He continued to use this approach on other tunes\, such as "Countdown"\, based on the Miles Davis tune "Tune Up"; "26 2" based on Charlie Parker's "Confirmation"; and a reharmonization of the jazz standard "Body and Soul." Songs such as "Naima" and "Like Sonny" also show some harmonic similarity to "Giant Steps." Coltrane continued to employ similar concepts in his soloing during his more open and modal middle period. A Love Supreme features examples of lines based on "Giant Steps" cycles over modal vamps\, to create a Polytonal effect (see modal jazz).  The progression continues to stimulate harmonic thinking in contemporary jazz. There are a number of different approaches to soloing on the song. While Coltrane favoured arpeggiation over the changes\, other players have used different tricks and patterns to bring out the sound of the changes. The chord progression was later used by Freddie Hubbard as a basis for his composition "Dear John" (on Hubbard's 1991 album Bolivia). Covers have been recorded by such artists as Rahsaan Roland Kirk\, Pat Metheny\, Buddy Rich\, Jaco Pastorius\, Mike Stern\, Greg Howe\, Tommy Flanagan (who played on the original recording)\, McCoy Tyner\, Kenny Werner\, Kenny Garrett\, Woody Herman\, and Taylor Eigsti\, Gary Bartz. The song was recorded by Chaka Khan in 1982 as part of the "Be Bop Medley" from her album "Chaka Khan".  John Coltrane was known for coming into the studio with unrehearsed songs - "Giant Steps" was no exception. On the original recording\, Tommy Flanagan (piano) played a choppy start-stop solo where it sounds like he is struggling to improvise over Coltrane changes without adequate preparation. Flanagan would revisit Giant Steps on several recordings later in his career and mastered the progression. In some of the alternate takes\, Cedar Walton is at the piano\, declining to take a solo and also playing at a slower tempo than the takes with Flanagan.	0

COL title VAL Hopelessly Devoted to You COL performer VAL Less Than Jake	COL video title VAL Les Elgart And His Orchestra -- Night and Day COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Les Elgart (3 de agosto\, 1917\, New Haven\, Connecticut - 29 de julio\, 1995\, Dallas\, Texas) fue un director de orquesta de jazz swing y trompetista.  Lester E. (Les) Elgart comenzó a tocar la trompeta cuando era un adolescente\, y con 20 años de edad había ya realizado conciertos profesionales. En la década de 1940 tocó en las bandas dirigidas por Raymond Scott\, Charlie Spivak\, y Harry James\, y de vez en cuando en  bandas junto con el hermano Larry. Juntos crean la suya propia "Les & Larry Elgart Ensemble" en 1945\, y contratan a Nelson Riddle\, Ralph Flanagan\, y Bill Finegan para  hacer arreglos.  La unión fue efímera\, sin embargo\, debido a la huelga de Músicos de la Unión  y la disminución de la popularidad del jazz de Swing\, se separaron en 1946. En 1952\, el dúo se reunió y publicó un número importante de álbumes en Columbia Records\, muchos de considerable éxito de ventas.  Entre sus canciones más conocidas es "Bandstand Boogie"\, que fue utilizado por Dick Clark como la canción de "American Bandstand. Más tarde\, en la década de 1950 Les alejado de los negocios y la manipulación del grupo puso fin a la banda.  Les siguió trabajando hasta su muerte por insuficiencia cardíaca en Dallas\, Texas en 1995.

COL title VAL Cowboy's Sweetheart COL performer VAL Taylor Ware	COL video title VAL The Bards - Goodtime Charlie's Got The Blues (1969 - Re-recording of their original version) COL channel name VAL ElvisKlan COL description VAL Info and label taken from David Neale websites: http://davidneale.eu/elvis/originals/list3.html#S1218 http://davidneale.eu/elvis/labels/get-back---i-gotta-know/index.html  Composer Danny O'Keefe recorded this number on no less than three separate occasions. He probably recorded the first version in 1967\, either for the Jerden label\, or for Piccadilly\, but it was not released; then came a version on the Cotillion label in 1971; finally O'Keefe recorded his hit version for the Signpost label in 1972. In the meantime\, however\, a relatively unknown group called The Bards\, from Moses Lake\, Washington\, recorded the number and released it in January 1969 on the Jerden label (Jerden 907) and a few months later on the Parrot label (Parrot 45-337). Elvis did not sing the lines "I got my pills to ease the pain\, Can't find a thing to ease my brain." Well\, that's what you read everywhere\, but according to The Bards' guitarist\, Mardi Sheridan\, the lines were\, in fact\, "Got my pills to ease the pain\, Can't find a thing to ease the rain." The Bards own site : bardsmusic.com   I thank Mike of The Bards for allowing me to put the song on Youtube. Here are some informations he sent me :  'Bards' is an old English word meaning musician\, minstrel\, poet\, or entertainer. The story behind our use of The Bards as the name of our '60's band was wanting to emulate the Beatles (of course\, British musicians). Also\, since we were more into writing music than writing lyrics\, we decided to take some classic poetry and put it to rock music. The story of our band is memorialized here: http://bardsmusic.com'   'The picture you refer to of us was taken in 2002. (for Youtube users: it's the last picture in the video) Wow\, 10 years ago already. There was a 4th Bard\, the drummer\, who passed\, but our reunion was inspired by an interesting series of events. Just for kicks\, back around 2001 I Googled The Bards and found a number of links and information\, including a compilation CD that had one of my songs on it. Of course\, I ordered it and later got a call from a producer who specialized in releasing previously un-released music from the 60's and 70's. He somehow knew about an album of material we had that was produced by the highly successful production team of Curt Boetcher and Keith Olson. We were basically high school kids from a small eastern Washing town called Moses Lake. We went to 'Hollywood' with our 'garage band' tapes\, met Keith and Curt in an elevator and long story short\, ended up with an albums worth of music that never got released because the new label they were trying to start didn't get financing. Anyway\, 35 years later we did release it as a result of that Google search. That's what inspired the Moses Lake Recordings\, The Bards Music web site tribute (where all of this is reported) and that reunion where the picture was taken. Anyway\, I still marvel at how the internet managed to 'transcend' space and time\, bringing that music out of obscurity\, as well as rekindling the relationship of the surviving band members'.

More info: http://www.DonnaLoren.com or purchase this song on ITunes.   This is a track from Donna Loren's newest album entitled "Love It Away"\, released in Spring\, 2010. A 53-minute video documentation of the entire album was produced and filmed in Los Angeles and this is one of the selections from that video. This will explain the continuity in wardrobe and staging in this series of videos from the "Love It Away" album on YouTube. The song was written by Bob Dylan from his "John Wesley Harding" album.  Donna Loren was the one-and-only "Dr Pepper Girl" from 1963 to 1968.

COL title VAL My Old Flame COL performer VAL The Platters	COL video title VAL Ferrante & Teicher -- Malagueña (Andalucía) COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Ferrante & Teicher eran un dúo de pianistas americanos\, conocidos por sus arreglos de piezas clásicas\, bandas sonoras de películas\, y todo tipo de ritmos. Arthur Ferrante  (7 de septiembre de 1921\, Nueva York - 19 de septiembre de 2009)\, y Louis Teicher (24 de agosto de 1924\, Wilkes-Barre\, Pennsylvania  - 3 de agosto de 2008) se conocieron mientras estudiaban en la Escuela Juilliard de Música de Nueva York. Niños prodigios de la música\, que comenzaron  a actuar como dúo de piano cuando aún estaban en la escuela.  En 1947\, comenzaron a dedicarse por completo al mundo de la música y rápidamente empiezan a ascender  tocando música clásica con respaldo orquestal. Steven Tyler de Aerosmith relata la historia de que en la década de 1950\, los dos estudiantes ensayaban en la casa de su abuela Constanza Neidhart Tallarico.  Entre 1950 y 1980\, fueron un importante dúo de música  easy listening\, consiguiendo  cuatro grandes EE.UU. golpea:  El tema de  "The Apartment" \, el Tema  de "Exodus  \, "Tonight" y "Cowboy de medianoche". Realizaron actuaciones y grabaciones de forma regular con las orquestas de George Gershwin \, Jerome Kern \, Cole Porter \, Richard Rodgers y otros  El dúo también experimentó con pianos preparados\, agregando papel\, palos de goma\, bloques de madera\, barras de metal\, cadenas\, cristales\, mazos y otros objetos que colocaban en las cuerdas del piano. De esta manera fueron capaces de producir una variedad de sonidos extraños que a veces se parecían a los instrumentos de percusión\, y en otras ocasiones sonaban como si se hubieran sintetizado electrónicamente.  Ferrante y Teicher dejaron de actuar en 1989 y se retiraron  a Longboat Key y Siesta Key \, respectivamente\, ambos cerca uno del otro en la costa oeste de Florida. Seguían tocando juntos\, de vez en cuando\, en una tienda local de pianos . Louis Teicher falleció de un ataque al corazón en agosto de 2008\, tres semanas antes de su cumpleaños número 84. Arthur Ferrante falleció de causas naturales el 19 de septiembre de 2009 a la edad de 88 años.  iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/es/album/hi-fiireworks/id837731730  Síguenos en: Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/vintagem.es Spotify: http://open.spotify.com/user/vintagemusic Web: http://www.vintagemusic.es BoutiqAlia: http://boutiqalia.com/store/vintage/ (compra física de CD) Compra nuestros Cd's en formato físico en estas plataformas: Ebay:  http://stores.ebay.com/VintageMusicFm BoutiqAlia: www.boutiqalia-vintagemusic.com Síguenos en: Spotify: https://goo.gl/raouHQ Facebook: https://goo.gl/L92BHL Instagram: https://goo.gl/3oYDGH Web: http://www.vintagemusic.es   Compra nuestros Cd's en formato físico en estas plataformas: Ebay:  http://stores.ebay.com/VintageMusicFm BoutiqAlia: www.boutiqalia-vintagemusic.com Discogs: https://www.discogs.com/es/seller/vintagemusicfm/profile	0

COL title VAL Gimme Some Lovin' COL performer VAL Lemar	COL video title VAL Ray Stevens - Yakety Yak COL channel name VAL raystevensbigfan COL description VAL "Yakety Yak" is from the album called Gitarzan was Rays' fourth studio album\, released in 1969\, as well as his second for Monument Records. Unlike his previous album\, Even Stevens\, this album is completely in the genres of novelty and comedy.   Although this is a true studio album\, all of the songs are overdubbed with cheering and applauding of an audience to provide the feeling of a live album. Cover versions include three of the Coasters' hits ("Yakety Yak\," "Little Egypt" and "Along Came Jones")\, "Mr. Custer\," and "Alley Oop." The album also contains re-recordings of his two novelty hits\, "Harry the Hairy Ape" and "Ahab the Arab." "Freddie Feelgood (And His Funky Little Five Piece Band)" makes its first appearance on an album but is overdubbed with audience noises for this album.  Aside from "Freddie Feelgood\," two singles were lifted from this album: the title track (which tells a bizarre story about Tarzan and Jane and Cheetah forming a music band) and "Along Came Jones". The album version of the former begins with cheers and applause from an audience while the single version does not.  On July 2\, 1996\, Varèse Sarabande rereleased this album on CD and included three bonus tracks\, all three of which were singles after the release of this album: "The Streak\," "The Moonlight Special\," and "Bridget the Midget (The Queen of the Blues)."	0

Arista pressed 2500 copies of the original LP "for Promotional Use Only."   Eventually some of the songs from this LP found their way onto CD re-releases of Al's albums as "bonus tracks\," and finally the (almost) complete "Blue Album" was released on CD in 2002 by BMG as "Time Passages Live."  Unfortunately\, BMG cut out some of Al's chatter between songs\, including his intro of the band\, so I edited in that part from an MP3 made from the original LP.	0

COL title VAL Back in Black COL performer VAL Damnation of Chaos	COL video title VAL DAVID RUFFIN -"RAINY NIGHT IN GEORGIA" (1971) COL channel name VAL MANNY MORA COL description VAL It's well known that Motown recorded more material than it could release\, but its reasons for shelving material remain a mystery to this day. Ever since the CD reissue boom of the late '80s\, this unreleased material has begun to trickle out of the vaults\, and when it does surface in such forms as the dynamite double-disc set A Cellarful of Motown!\, the music is so good it's hard to believe that it never was released at the time. Knowing this\, it should not come as a complete surprise that former Temptations lead singer David Ruffin had a full\, completed album shelved in 1971\, but hearing Hip-O Select's excavation of that album on the 2004 release David: The Unreleased Album\, it's still a wonder that this record sat in the vaults for over three decades\, with very few of the songs recorded during the sessions appearing on other records and compilations over the years. Far from being unreleasable\, David (titled as such because the album was never given a proper title -- it was given a catalog number and track sequencing\, with David Ruffin penciled in as its name\, but that was used as the title for his 1973 album) finds Ruffin at a solo peak\, not just a singer but in terms of material. He cut the 12 songs that comprised the album\, along with the seven bonus tracks from the same sessions that fill out this CD reissue\, in late 1969 and 1970\, after he had a big solo hit with "My Whole World Ended (The Moment You Left Me)\," with the intent of releasing the album in 1971. There were a pair of covers of recent hits -- an appropriately heartbroken and seductive "Rainy Night in Georgia" and a rather revelatory "I Want You Back\," which added real grit to the Jackson 5's effervescent smash -- but most of this was material written for Ruffin and it played to his strengths. While this music was rooted in Motown's signature sound and performed by the Funk Brothers\, it also looked beyond Detroit\, adding heavy doses of funk\, psychedelia\, and smooth soul\, filled with galvanizing horns\, driving guitars\, down-n-dirty clavinets\, flourishes of electric sitar\, fuzz tones\, and wah-wah guitars\, all grounded by Ruffin's earthy testifying and tied together by top-notch songwriting. All these elements wound up sounding much hipper than much of the music officially released by Motown in the early 1970\, when Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye were just beginning to break free of the studio's formula\, and while David and its accompanying bonus tracks are not a masterpiece along the lines of Talking Book or What's Going On (or even Where I'm Coming From\, for that matter)\, it's vibrant\, exciting music that still sounds fresh -- arguably fresher than full-length Temptations albums of the late '60s -- which qualifies it as a lost classic of sorts. Why was it lost\, consigned to the vaults for nearly three and a half decades? According to the liner notes\, nobody really knows. Ruffin wasn't popular among the executives at Motown in the early '70s\, and he was also going through a number of well-documented personal problems\, so it's possible that Motown simply didn't want to promote him at the time\, but it's also true that the label had a number of great records\, including Marvin's What's Going On\, to release in 1971\, and Ruffin had two LPs out in 1970\, including a duet album with his brother Jimmy\, so the market may have been saturated. We'll likely never know the reason why David was buried\, but fortunately it has been unearthed\, and it's a reason for hardcore soul and Motown fans to celebrate.	0

Pubblicata nel 1938\, la canzone fu inserita nel musical di Broadway "This Way" \,in cui venne  eseguita dal cantante Tamara Drasin\, che aveva qualche anno prima cantato "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes". Il brano è uno standard jazz\, ed è statoinciso da numerosi artisti nel corso degli anni. Il tema musicale ha potere emotivo\, ed è stato molto amato durante la seconda guerra mondiale\, quando divenne un inno per coloro che prestavano servizio all'estero (dai soldati britannici e  americani). La versione più ricordata è quella di Billie Holiday (1944) e altrettanto nota è quella di Bing Crosby dello stesso anno\, dal film omonimo con  Ginger Rogers and Joseph Cotten. Mina la propone nel suo album "12 American Songbook" del 2012.

COL title VAL Break My Mind COL performer VAL Linda Ronstadt	COL video title VAL Dinah Shore -- They Didn't Believe Me COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Dinah Shore  Frances Rose Shore (Winchester\, 1 de marzo de 1917 - Beverly Hills\, 24 de febrero de 1994)\, conocida como Dinah Shore\, fue una cantante estadounidense de jazz y música popular. Fraguada en las big bands de los años treinta\, Dinah se convirtió en los cuarenta en una de las artistas más populares de los Estados Unidos gracias a su interpretación de numerosos éxitos musicales\, como "Buttons and Bows"\, "The Gypsy" y "I´ll Walk Alone"\, y en años sucesivos gracias a su aparición en varios programas televisivos. Nacida en el rural del estado de Tennessee\, Dinah Shore trabajó en la radio de Nashville ya cuando era adolescente. Su carrera profesional se inició más tarde en Nueva York donde cantó con Xavier Cugat. Tras fallidas audiciones para trabajar con Benny Goodman y Tommy Dorsey\, se decidió por convertirse en una cantante individual. Firmó con Bluebird en 1940-1941\, grabó varios éxitos\, entre los que figuran "Yes\, My Darling Daughter"\, "I Hear a Rhapsody" y "Jim". En 1942 vendió un millón de ejemplares del tema "Blues in the Night". Firmó luego con la compañía RCA Victor y obtuvo un nuevo gran éxito con "You´d Be So Nice to Come Home To" y\, sobre todo\, en 1944 con "I´ll Walk Alone". Trabajó también en algunas películas\, como por ejemplo en 1944 en Up in Arms y en 1946 en Till the Clouds Roll By. Entre 1946 y 1949 destacan temas como "The Gypsy"\, "I Love You for Sentimental Reasons"\, "Anniversary Song"\, "I Wish I Didn´t Love You So"\, "Buttons and Bows" y "Dear Hearts and Gentle People". En los cincuenta fue famosa más que por su música por su espectáculo televisivo de variedades The Dinah Shore Chevy Show\, medio en el que trabajaría de forma irregular hasta los años ochenta. Murió de un cáncer.   iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/es/album/a-wonderful-guy/id879697670 Spotify: http://open.spotify.com/album/5mkWSBfR3EWhh6EKdGEGpo Síguenos en: Spotify: https://goo.gl/raouHQ Facebook: https://goo.gl/L92BHL Instagram: https://goo.gl/3oYDGH Web: http://www.vintagemusic.es   Compra nuestros Cd's en formato físico en estas plataformas: Ebay:  http://stores.ebay.com/VintageMusicFm BoutiqAlia: www.boutiqalia-vintagemusic.com Discogs: https://www.discogs.com/es/seller/vintagemusicfm/profile	0

( Famous Blue Raincoat ) COL channel name VAL Sirens Meadow COL description VAL Album  " Hadde månen en søster: Cohen på norsk " \, ( 1993 )  Det er fire om morgenen\, det er sent i desember. Jeg skriver for å spørre deg hvordan du har det. Det er vinter i Oslo\, men for meg er det stedet. Det er musikk fra kaféen i Pilestredet. Jeg har hørt at du flyttet til en øy ute ved kysten. Kan du leve for ingenting nå? Syns du skal føre et slags regnskap.  Og han var her med en lokk av ditt hår. Han sa han fikk den den natten i vår\, da du trodde du skulle gå fri. Har du noen gang gått fri?  Du så mye eldre ut sist gang vi så deg. Du kledde ikke klærne du hadde tatt på deg. Du sto på perrongen -- der hver møtte sin\, men du gikk alltid hjemover uten James Dean. Så tok du min elsker\, du tok ham for gitt. Og da han kom hjem\, var hans liv ikke mitt.  Å\, jeg ser deg der\, med en rose i munnen. Ei sigøynerske gjorde et funn. Vel\, jeg ser han er våken her nå. Han ber meg å hilse.  Hva kan jeg få sagt deg\, min søster\, min morderske? Hva kan jeg si deg med ord? Jeg tror nok jeg savner deg\, tror nok jeg tilgir deg\, glad at du gjorde det du gjorde. Om du kommer tilbake\, om du kommer forbi: Din fiende sover nå\, og mannen hennes er fri.  Og takk for det mørket du tok fra hans blikk. Det har jeg aldri forsøkt. Jeg trodde ikke det gikk.  Og han var her med en lokk av ditt hår. Han sa han fikk den den natten i vår\, da du trodde du skulle gå fri.  Med hilsen din venn  Original : Leonard Cohen  It's four in the morning\, the end of December I'm writing you now just to see if you're better New York is cold\, but I like where I'm living There's music on Clinton Street  all through the evening.  I hear that you're building  your little house deep in the desert You're living for nothing now\,  I hope you're keeping some kind of record.  Yes\, and Jane came by with a lock of your hair She said that you gave it to her That night that you planned to go clear Did you ever go clear?  Ah\, the last time we saw you  you looked so much older Your famous blue raincoat  was torn at the shoulder You'd been to the station  to meet every train And you came home without Lili Marlene  And you treated my woman  to a flake of your life And when she came back  she was nobody's wife.  Well I see you there with  the rose in your teeth One more thin gypsy thief Well I see Jane's awake -- She sends her regards.  And what can I tell you  my brother\, my killer What can I possibly say? I guess that I miss you\,  I guess I forgive you I'm glad you stood in my way.  If you ever come by here\, for Jane or for me Your enemy is sleeping\, and his woman is free.  Yes\, and thanks\, for the trouble  you took from her eyes I thought it was there for good  so I never tried.  And Jane came by with a lock of your hair She said that you gave it to her That night that you planned to go clear  -- Sincerely\, L. Cohen	0

COL title VAL My Funny Valentine COL performer VAL John Nicol	COL video title VAL Michel Legrand Orchestra - My Funny Valentine COL channel name VAL ifcopod COL description VAL Michel Legrand rarely replicates treatment of songs. Richard Rodgers' My Funny Valentine has benefited from myriad interpretations. The first here from 1974 shot through with rapid string interjections featuring jazz harmonica Toots Thielemans.If you dont like this arrangement join a  club~  Your   own club because  some  sad to say   come a cropper on this type of Legrand  Why does he not play the music straight ? Thats the  point    People who have problems with this probably  are not too keen on  the orchestra  in the first place. An  "on your toes"  encapsulation of  Legrand  is his ever alert ever   changing ~   approach ..  The second  styling  from 1962 features alto saxist Phil Woods capped superbly by Bill Costa\, Warren Smith\, Gary Burton (vibes) and a battery of percussion. The mood is cool jazz the arrangement   ~ Legrand. Have you noticed a wholly sneaky thing  happening on U Tube. A  raft of stuff  disappearing from our midst.Point in question. 1963  Reprise  album    Duke Ellingtons Symphonic Ellington    appeared some time ago  leaving Ifcopod  and musical confreres   in a delirious state of expectation. Suddenly   "now you see it now you dont"   all vamoosed  before  the word google might  censoriously  escape  from   pursed parchment  lips  Judge Judy.  .Luckily I had a copy of " la Scala She too pretty"  a delightful highlight  from Symphonic Ellington instinct with typical Ellington  orchestral  nuance nevertheless it would have been handy to have a U Tube copy on standby.  The slaughter  continues apace.  Whole wodges of stuff is getting  similar treatment ". I thought i was away on a hack  mentally storing up all  downloadable prospects. Any  in particular? Now that you ask.  Lady is a Tramp  by your friend and mine George Siravo Orchestra.  but  a slew of U Tube goodies  dangled before   greedy  eyes  suddenly snatched away  what can a  person say?. Let me  asseverate~ this is below the belt.   Now   scramble for  asseveration  in the dictionary  Last time asseveration  was invoked   someone  said surely you  mean assertion. and so our  anecdote totters to a hapless  demise.	1

COL title VAL Creole Love Call COL performer VAL Herbie Mann	COL video title VAL Lawdy Miss Clawdy. The Swinging Blue Jeans COL channel name VAL Dato Karchava COL description VAL "Lawdy Miss Clawdy" is a song by Lloyd Price. It was first recorded by Price at the New Orleans recording studio of Specialty Records in March 1952. It was released under the Specialty label in April and was number one on the Billboard rhythm and blues chart for seven weeks and stayed on the chart for six months. An 8-bar blues with a rollicking piano backup\, with the words written by Price\, but the melody adapted from the older Junker Blues (Champion Jack Dupree\, 1941)\, it became the biggest rhythm and blues hit of the year and sold over one million copies by crossing over to the white record-buying market. It was the first hit from New Orleans to be accepted into rock and roll. The word "lawdy" means Lord.

I wake up craving crisp autumn mornings. It's weather that will make you feel like a strawberry (reference to Lady Salvia). Anyway\, Memphis in June reminds me of that\, too\, despite what an obviously lazy summer song it is\, so here it is. I could only find a video with some dude playing it on guitar\, and he was badass\, but I really dig Hoagy Carmichael's voice and style. Check out "Two Sleepy People." Someone uploaded it to Youtube with a bunch of pictures of little dogs\, haha. Hoagy Carmichael is great in it\, but Ella Logan steals the show.	0

Pubblicata nel 1938\, la canzone fu inserita nel musical di Broadway "This Way" \,in cui venne  eseguita dal cantante Tamara Drasin\, che aveva qualche anno prima cantato "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes". Il brano è uno standard jazz\, ed è statoinciso da numerosi artisti nel corso degli anni. Il tema musicale ha potere emotivo\, ed è stato molto amato durante la seconda guerra mondiale\, quando divenne un inno per coloro che prestavano servizio all'estero (dai soldati britannici e  americani). La versione più ricordata è quella di Billie Holiday (1944) e altrettanto nota è quella di Bing Crosby dello stesso anno\, dal film omonimo con  Ginger Rogers and Joseph Cotten. Mina la propone nel suo album "12 American Songbook" del 2012.

COL title VAL Don't Think Twice\, It's All Right COL performer VAL Merle Haggard and Willie Nelson	COL video title VAL Francesco de gregori   acido seminterrato COL channel name VAL Gabriele Cordovani COL description VAL Acido seminterrato (traduzione italiana di Subterranean homesick blues)  Amore e Furto è un album di traduzioni in italiano di canzoni di Bob Dylan\, che celebra la reverente ammirazione di De Gregori per il cantautore statunitense. Alcuni brani dell'album\, in realtà\, erano già stati tradotti in italiano molti anni prima\, come Non dirle che non è così e Come il giorno.  Si tratta del secondo album completo di traduzioni di canzoni di Dylan pubblicato in Italia\, il primo fu nel 1987 Dylaniato di Tito Schipa Jr.  Gli arrangiamenti tendono a rispettare una certa fedeltà nei confronti delle versioni dell'autore originale. Riguardo agli arrangiamenti\, infatti\, il cantante romano dice che «sono talmente belli che sarebbe stupido andare a cambiare quello che ha fatto gente come Daniel Lanois o Mark Knopfler per quei brani; inoltre\, poiché nella traduzione inevitabilmente si perde qualcosa\, almeno negli arrangiamenti volevo essere più aderente. Tuttavia nelle parole e il ritmo\, la metrica ti impongono qualche cambiamento: c’è una ricerca della fedeltà che è sempre disattesa\, perché non si può tradurre per filo e per segno. Per mantenere la bellezza e la gradevolezza della canzoni qualche cambiamento va fatto per forza». L'armonica non viene mai suonata da De Gregori nel disco\, per non sovrapporre una parte sua a una di Dylan nella canzone originale.	0

Arista pressed 2500 copies of the original LP "for Promotional Use Only."   Eventually some of the songs from this LP found their way onto CD re-releases of Al's albums as "bonus tracks\," and finally the (almost) complete "Blue Album" was released on CD in 2002 by BMG as "Time Passages Live."  Unfortunately\, BMG cut out some of Al's chatter between songs\, including his intro of the band\, so I edited in that part from an MP3 made from the original LP.	0

Considerati dei ragazzini prodigio\, iniziarono la loro attività concertistica giovanissimi. Prima ancora di ottenere la laurea iniziarono l'attività in duo che portarono avanti assieme per tutta la loro vita. Nel 1947 intrapresero una carriera concertistica a tempo pieno\, prima nei night club\, poi in esibizioni di musica classica con orchestra al seguito. Tra il 1950 e il 1980 furono tra i principali artisti easy listening d'America e ottennero numerosi successi discografici. Fra i loro maggiori successi si possono citare: "Theme From The Apartment"\, "Exodus"\, "Tonight" e "Midnight Cowboy". Essi realizzarono frequenti registrazioni con le maggiori orchestre pop tra le quali si ricordano quelle dirette da George Gershwin\, Jerome Kern\, Cole Porter\, Richard Rodgers ed altre ancora.   ------------------------------------------------------------ Ferrante & Teicher was een Amerikaans pianoduo . Zij waren vooral bekend om hun arrangement van bekende klassieke en filmmuziek.  Arthur Ferrante (New York City\, 7 september - 1921 - 19 september 2009) en Louis Teicher (Wilkes Barre\, 24 augustus 1924 - 3 augustus 2008) leerden elkaar kennen toen zij studeerden aan de "Juilliard School" voor muziek in New York. Beiden waren muzikaal zeer begaafd en begonnen als pianoduo op te treden\, toen ze nog op school zaten. Na hun afstuderen gingen beiden aan de slag aan de Juilliard-faculteit.  In 1947 begonnen zij een voltijdse concertcarrière. Ze speelden eerst in nachtclubs\, maar schakelden al snel over naar het spelen van klassieke muziek met orkestbegeleiding. Tussen 1950 en 1980 waren zij een der belangrijkste Amerikaanse "easy listening"-groepen en scoorden zij vier grote hits: "Theme From The Apartment" (Pop #10)\, "Exodus" (Pop #2)\, "Tonight" (Pop #8)\, and "Midnight Cowboy" (Pop #10). Zij traden op en namen platen op met nummers van George Gershwin\, Jerome Kern\, Cole Porter en Richard Rodgers. In 1973 speelden zij het openingsnummer van het radiodrama The Zero Hour van Rod Sterling. Het duo deed ook aan "avant garde".	0

A vocal version was also released and performed by Melina Mercouri in the film of same name directed by Jules Dassin and starring Mercouri. Written by Hadjidakis\, the song won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1960\, a first for a foreign-language picture. The film score to the movie was first released on October 1\, 1960 by United Artists Records. The song has since been covered by numerous artists\, and has gained various degrees of success throughout the world.  Background  The original Greek version featured lyrics also written by Hadjidakis was performed in the film by Melina Mercouri. The original Greek lyrics (along with the foreign translations in German\, French and Italian) tell the story of the main female character of the film\, Illya (Mercouri). Illya is a jolly woman who enjoys life\, the town and the people of her native Piraeus. Although she earns her money as a prostitute\, she longs to meet a man someday who is just as full of joie de vivre as she is herself.  In 1960\, the song was nominated and won the Academy Award for Best Original Song\, a first for a foreign-language picture since the Academy began to recognize achievements in this category in 1934. An orchestral version recorded by Don Costa reached number 19 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1960\, while it also remained on the chart into 1961. Following the success of the orchestral version as well as the Oscar win\, an English language version of the song was commissioned to be written especially to match the title of the film. The lyrics to the English version of the song were written by Billy Towne. A vocal cover of the song by The Chordettes reached number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1961.  Lale Andersen scored a number one hit in 1960 with the German language version of the song titled "Ein Schiff wird kommen".  In 2010\, a remixed dance version of the song was released by newly formed group Aroma (consisting of Raf Marchesini\, Max B and Ilario Drago) under the title "The Children of Piraeus". English\, Greek\, and French versions of the song were released\, with the English and Greek versions feature vocals by Fame Story 3 contestant Katerina Bourneli\, while the French version features vocals by In-Grid. The song was co-produced by Ego Music Italy and Planetworks Records Greece.  Covers  The song has been covered in a number of languages since its release:  Greek (as Τα Παιδιά του Πειραιά) by Melina Mercouri\, Nana Mouskouri\, Andy Williams\, and Pink Martini. English (as Never on Sunday) by Bing Crosby\, Done Costa\, Lena Horne\, Doris Day\, Andy Williams\, Connie Francis\, Petula Clark\, Lale Andersen\, and The Chordettes.

COL title VAL On a Clear Day (You Can See Forever) COL performer VAL Carmen McRae	COL video title VAL Autumn In New York By Arthur Prysock COL channel name VAL texpaco COL description VAL This man absolutely owns this song !  Arthur Prysock was an American jazz singer best known for his live shows and his deep soulful baritone voice.  He has often been characterized as a deep-voiced Billy Eckstine\, and his singing style was very similar.  He joined bandleader Buddy Johnson as a vocalist in 1944 and became a mainstay of the live performance circuits.  He sang on several of Johnson's hits including "Jet My Love"\, "I Wonder Where Our Love Has Gone"\, and "Because".  He gained much attention for his tender\, soulful singing on a beer commercial\, "Tonight\, tonight\, let it be Löwenbräu."  He had a surprise disco hit with "When Love Is New" in 1977\, and much of his older recordings regained attention.  He received a Pioneer Award from the Rhythm and Blues Foundation in 1995.  This selection is from his album "Morning\, Noon And Night—The Collection".	0

COL title VAL Ah-Leu-Cha COL performer VAL Charlie Parker's All Stars	COL video title VAL 'Ah Leu Cha' Tony Purrone\, Eddie Gomez\, Lenny White COL channel name VAL lemmingthought COL description VAL by Charlie Parker  Tony Purrone\, guitar Eddie Gomez\, bass Lenny White\, drums  From the album 'Set 'em Up\,' 8/01/96\, Steeplechase http://www.amazon.com/Set-Em-Up/dp/B002RAZ4IY/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&s=dmusic&qid=1320018143&sr=1-12  From the All Music Guide:       Purrone's high-velocity picking and his solid-body instrument are not exactly the stuff of a jazz guitar traditionalist\, despite the acoustic jazz thrust of this and subsequent recordings. While Purrone displays straight-ahead smarts on "How Deep Is The Ocean" and "Ah Leu Cha\," he's equally able to venture into post-bop territory where few guitarists tread\, at least not in a trio setting. On Wayne Shorter's "Toy Tune" and Herbie Hancock's "Sorceror\," for instance\, Purrone succeeds in conveying the harmonic complexity of the music despite the inherent orchestral limitations of his instrument. What's more\, he makes it sound natural\, not like a struggle. His original compositions are also strong\, especially the waltz "Pequonnock Valley Walk." ~ David R. Adler	1

COL title VAL Tango for to COL performer VAL Raquel Rastenni m. Harry Felberts orkester	COL video title VAL Bert Kaempfert - Someday we'll be together COL channel name VAL Socratess2007 COL description VAL Bert Kaempfert re-arranged many "hit songs" of the sixties and seventies for his orchestra.  When hearing such a piece\, you each time discover that "Bert knew his business as no other".  Not only did he each time "stick to his own style" but he also exactly knew how to accentuate certain parts of a song.  This arrangement eg of the famous Supremes hit "Someday we'll be together" contains all the typical Kaempfert ingredients (the Botho Lucas choir softly humming in the background\, the famous "knack-bass" of Ladi Geisler\, the alternating brass) but the title refrain here is being accentuated by the choir actually singing the words (together with trumpets).  True Kaempfert fans will know that this is rather exceptional in Kaempfert recordings\, but we assume Bert - in this case - found it necessary to "make the music complete".  Obviously he also will have been influenced by the "time spirit" of the seventies where "vocal groups" and choirs were becoming more and more popular.  Maybe this does not belong to Bert's "best" work\, but on the whole these "hits à la Kaempfert" remain "standard good quality music" - even up to this day.  From the 1970 album "The Kaempfert Touch" here are Bert Kaempfert and His Orchestra with their interpretation of "Someday we'll be together".  Enjoy ! (And oh yes : feel free to disagree ;-)  that's what the 'comments board' is there for !!)	0

The  closing theme to 'The Liberace Show' & his on-stage performances.   Note: There is "0"evidence of Liberace being homosexual/gay. He was once engaged to actress Joanne Rio & frequently dated countless other women; not men! He testified (under oath) & denied being homosexual (or ever taken part in homosexual practices) in a 1956 defamation trial against the Daily Mirror. He further won a libel suit (1957) against Confidential Magazine for publishing a malicious article alluding to him being a homosexual. In Liberace's biography 'The Wonderful 'Private' World of Liberace' there is no mention of him being homosexual\, engaging in homosexual practices\, or an affair with Scott Thorson??? Chapter Three does mention his affairs with women. Liberace was not gay!!!	0

COL title VAL Whole Lot-ta Shakin' Goin' On COL performer VAL Jimmy Breedlove	COL video title VAL Torero Band [Tijuana Christmas] Sound of Brass - The Holly & The Ivy [HQ Audio] COL channel name VAL choccystarfish1 COL description VAL Dance to your favourite Carols with the wonderful 'Sound of Brass' !  Oh the memories this provokes!  Hope some others of you had to endure this in your childhood!  [Sleeve notes]  Christmas is the most joyful festival of the Christian year\, when we celebrate at the same time the turning point of winter and the new hope that was brought to men with the birth of Jesus.  Christmas is a time when we make up for the bleakness of the weather outside with the warmth of our spirits and it is no coincidence that the songs which have become particularly associated with Christmas should be carols\, which have always been the most cheerful and often the most secular of Christian songs.  On this record you will find your favourite carols in an unfamiliar guise - we've called the album 'Tijuana Christmas'\, but you will hear the mariachi sound taking on a richer and more varied flavour as the Torero Band bring out the charms of our most beautiful carol tunes in imaginative brand new arrangements.  'The Holly & the Ivy' sets the pace with a bright\, sparkling beat that even adds to the gaiety of one of our oldest and liveliest carols; 'Silent Night' a much more recent and a more devout carol\, is given quite a contrasting treatment\, slow and tender.  'Hark! The Herald Angels Sing' sets off again at a brisk\, bouncy pace - and if you feel like dancing\, why not?  It may come as a surprise to you that our oldest carols used to be dances and that the word itself described a form of circular dance.  In the preface to the Oxford Book of Carols you will find carols described as songs with a religious impulse that are simple\, popular and modern.  You'll never have heard them sounding more joyful\, popular or modern than they do on this exciting and original LP. (Blase Machin)	0

COL title VAL Nobody Knows When You're Down and Out COL performer VAL Sam Cooke	COL video title VAL Lawdy Miss Clawdy. The Swinging Blue Jeans COL channel name VAL Dato Karchava COL description VAL "Lawdy Miss Clawdy" is a song by Lloyd Price. It was first recorded by Price at the New Orleans recording studio of Specialty Records in March 1952. It was released under the Specialty label in April and was number one on the Billboard rhythm and blues chart for seven weeks and stayed on the chart for six months. An 8-bar blues with a rollicking piano backup\, with the words written by Price\, but the melody adapted from the older Junker Blues (Champion Jack Dupree\, 1941)\, it became the biggest rhythm and blues hit of the year and sold over one million copies by crossing over to the white record-buying market. It was the first hit from New Orleans to be accepted into rock and roll. The word "lawdy" means Lord.

COL title VAL The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face COL performer VAL Celine Dion	COL video title VAL Nat King Cole - Wouldn't It Be Loverly COL channel name VAL uschisfly COL description VAL "...I started out to become a jazz pianist; in the meantime I started singing and I sang the way I felt and that's just the way it came out."  Nathaniel Adams Coles (March 17\, 1919 -- February 15\, 1965)\, known professionally as Nat King Cole\, was an American musician who first came to prominence as a leading jazz pianist. He owes most of his popular musical fame to his soft baritone voice\, which he used to perform in big band and jazz genres. He was one of the first black Americans to host a television variety show\, and has maintained worldwide popularity since his death.  Cole was a smoker of Kool menthol cigarettes\, believing that smoking up to three packs a day gave his voice its rich sound (Cole would smoke several cigarettes in rapid succession before a recording). He died from lung cancer on February 15\, 1965\, at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica\, California.  One of the last albums Nat recorded prior to his death was a collection of songs from Lerner & Lowe's "My Fair Lady" as a tribute to the enthusiasm his fans showed whenever he toured England. "Wouldn't It Be Loverly" was recorded on Sep\, 17\, 1963.  Lyrics: All I want is a room somewhere Far away from the cold night air With one enormous chair Oh\, wouldn't it be loverly?  Lots of chocolate for me to eat Lots of coal makin' lots of heat Warm face\, warm hands\, warm feet Oh\, wouldn't it be loverly?  Oh so loverly sittin' abso-bloomin'-lutely still I would never budge till Spring crept over mi window sill  Someone's head restin' on my knee Warm and tender as he can be Who takes good care of me Oh\, wouldn't it be loverly?  Oh so loverly sittin' abso-bloomin'-lutely still I would never budge till Spring crept over mi window sill  Someone's head restin' on my knee Warm and tender as he can be Who takes good care of me Oh\, wouldn't it be loverly?

COL title VAL Someone Like You COL performer VAL Tale of Voices	COL video title VAL Billie Holiday - Georgia On My Mind (OKeh Records 1941) COL channel name VAL RoundMidnightTV COL description VAL "Georgia on My Mind" is a song written in 1930 by Hoagy Carmichael (music) and Stuart Gorrell (lyrics). It is the official state song of the U.S. state of Georgia. Gorrell wrote the lyrics for Hoagy's sister\, Georgia Carmichael. However\, the lyrics of the song are ambiguous enough to refer either to the state or to a woman named "Georgia". Carmichael's 1965 autobiography\, Sometimes I Wonder\, records the origin: a friend\, saxophonist and bandleader Frankie Trumbauer\, suggested: "Why don't you write a song called 'Georgia?' Nobody lost much writing about the South." Thus\, the song is universally believed to have been written about the state. The song was first recorded on September 15\, 1930 in New York by Hoagy Carmichael and His Orchestra with Bix Beiderbecke on muted cornet and Hoagy Carmichael on vocals. The recording was part of Bix Beiderbecke's last recording session. The recording was released as Victor 23013 with "One Night in Havana".  Billie's accompanied by Shad Collins tp; Leslie Johnakins\, Eddie Barefield as; Lester Young ts; Eddie Heywood p; John Collins g; Ted Sturgis b; Kenny Clarke ds.  Recorded in New York City\, March 21\, 1941.

( Famous Blue Raincoat ) COL channel name VAL Sirens Meadow COL description VAL Album  " Hadde månen en søster: Cohen på norsk " \, ( 1993 )  Det er fire om morgenen\, det er sent i desember. Jeg skriver for å spørre deg hvordan du har det. Det er vinter i Oslo\, men for meg er det stedet. Det er musikk fra kaféen i Pilestredet. Jeg har hørt at du flyttet til en øy ute ved kysten. Kan du leve for ingenting nå? Syns du skal føre et slags regnskap.  Og han var her med en lokk av ditt hår. Han sa han fikk den den natten i vår\, da du trodde du skulle gå fri. Har du noen gang gått fri?  Du så mye eldre ut sist gang vi så deg. Du kledde ikke klærne du hadde tatt på deg. Du sto på perrongen -- der hver møtte sin\, men du gikk alltid hjemover uten James Dean. Så tok du min elsker\, du tok ham for gitt. Og da han kom hjem\, var hans liv ikke mitt.  Å\, jeg ser deg der\, med en rose i munnen. Ei sigøynerske gjorde et funn. Vel\, jeg ser han er våken her nå. Han ber meg å hilse.  Hva kan jeg få sagt deg\, min søster\, min morderske? Hva kan jeg si deg med ord? Jeg tror nok jeg savner deg\, tror nok jeg tilgir deg\, glad at du gjorde det du gjorde. Om du kommer tilbake\, om du kommer forbi: Din fiende sover nå\, og mannen hennes er fri.  Og takk for det mørket du tok fra hans blikk. Det har jeg aldri forsøkt. Jeg trodde ikke det gikk.  Og han var her med en lokk av ditt hår. Han sa han fikk den den natten i vår\, da du trodde du skulle gå fri.  Med hilsen din venn  Original : Leonard Cohen  It's four in the morning\, the end of December I'm writing you now just to see if you're better New York is cold\, but I like where I'm living There's music on Clinton Street  all through the evening.  I hear that you're building  your little house deep in the desert You're living for nothing now\,  I hope you're keeping some kind of record.  Yes\, and Jane came by with a lock of your hair She said that you gave it to her That night that you planned to go clear Did you ever go clear?  Ah\, the last time we saw you  you looked so much older Your famous blue raincoat  was torn at the shoulder You'd been to the station  to meet every train And you came home without Lili Marlene  And you treated my woman  to a flake of your life And when she came back  she was nobody's wife.  Well I see you there with  the rose in your teeth One more thin gypsy thief Well I see Jane's awake -- She sends her regards.  And what can I tell you  my brother\, my killer What can I possibly say? I guess that I miss you\,  I guess I forgive you I'm glad you stood in my way.  If you ever come by here\, for Jane or for me Your enemy is sleeping\, and his woman is free.  Yes\, and thanks\, for the trouble  you took from her eyes I thought it was there for good  so I never tried.  And Jane came by with a lock of your hair She said that you gave it to her That night that you planned to go clear  -- Sincerely\, L. Cohen	0

COL title VAL Traces COL performer VAL Bert Kaempfert and His Orchestra	COL video title VAL Dinah Shore -- They Didn't Believe Me COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Dinah Shore  Frances Rose Shore (Winchester\, 1 de marzo de 1917 - Beverly Hills\, 24 de febrero de 1994)\, conocida como Dinah Shore\, fue una cantante estadounidense de jazz y música popular. Fraguada en las big bands de los años treinta\, Dinah se convirtió en los cuarenta en una de las artistas más populares de los Estados Unidos gracias a su interpretación de numerosos éxitos musicales\, como "Buttons and Bows"\, "The Gypsy" y "I´ll Walk Alone"\, y en años sucesivos gracias a su aparición en varios programas televisivos. Nacida en el rural del estado de Tennessee\, Dinah Shore trabajó en la radio de Nashville ya cuando era adolescente. Su carrera profesional se inició más tarde en Nueva York donde cantó con Xavier Cugat. Tras fallidas audiciones para trabajar con Benny Goodman y Tommy Dorsey\, se decidió por convertirse en una cantante individual. Firmó con Bluebird en 1940-1941\, grabó varios éxitos\, entre los que figuran "Yes\, My Darling Daughter"\, "I Hear a Rhapsody" y "Jim". En 1942 vendió un millón de ejemplares del tema "Blues in the Night". Firmó luego con la compañía RCA Victor y obtuvo un nuevo gran éxito con "You´d Be So Nice to Come Home To" y\, sobre todo\, en 1944 con "I´ll Walk Alone". Trabajó también en algunas películas\, como por ejemplo en 1944 en Up in Arms y en 1946 en Till the Clouds Roll By. Entre 1946 y 1949 destacan temas como "The Gypsy"\, "I Love You for Sentimental Reasons"\, "Anniversary Song"\, "I Wish I Didn´t Love You So"\, "Buttons and Bows" y "Dear Hearts and Gentle People". En los cincuenta fue famosa más que por su música por su espectáculo televisivo de variedades The Dinah Shore Chevy Show\, medio en el que trabajaría de forma irregular hasta los años ochenta. Murió de un cáncer.   iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/es/album/a-wonderful-guy/id879697670 Spotify: http://open.spotify.com/album/5mkWSBfR3EWhh6EKdGEGpo Síguenos en: Spotify: https://goo.gl/raouHQ Facebook: https://goo.gl/L92BHL Instagram: https://goo.gl/3oYDGH Web: http://www.vintagemusic.es   Compra nuestros Cd's en formato físico en estas plataformas: Ebay:  http://stores.ebay.com/VintageMusicFm BoutiqAlia: www.boutiqalia-vintagemusic.com Discogs: https://www.discogs.com/es/seller/vintagemusicfm/profile	0

Also\, it's the original Memphis Blues\, Handy's first popular success!  Recorded by Victor Military Band\, July 15\, 1914.  Hope you all enjoy!  A bit of info:  In 1909 Handy and his band moved to Memphis\, Tennessee\, where they started playing at clubs on Beale Street. The genesis of his "Memphis Blues" was as a campaign tune written for Edward Crump\, a successful Memphis mayoral candidate in 1909. Handy later rewrote the tune and changed its name from "Mr. Crump" to "Memphis Blues."	0
COL title VAL What the World Needs Now Is Love COL performer VAL Martin Denny	COL video title VAL Ray Stevens - Yakety Yak COL channel name VAL raystevensbigfan COL description VAL "Yakety Yak" is from the album called Gitarzan was Rays' fourth studio album\, released in 1969\, as well as his second for Monument Records. Unlike his previous album\, Even Stevens\, this album is completely in the genres of novelty and comedy.   Although this is a true studio album\, all of the songs are overdubbed with cheering and applauding of an audience to provide the feeling of a live album. Cover versions include three of the Coasters' hits ("Yakety Yak\," "Little Egypt" and "Along Came Jones")\, "Mr. Custer\," and "Alley Oop." The album also contains re-recordings of his two novelty hits\, "Harry the Hairy Ape" and "Ahab the Arab." "Freddie Feelgood (And His Funky Little Five Piece Band)" makes its first appearance on an album but is overdubbed with audience noises for this album.  Aside from "Freddie Feelgood\," two singles were lifted from this album: the title track (which tells a bizarre story about Tarzan and Jane and Cheetah forming a music band) and "Along Came Jones". The album version of the former begins with cheers and applause from an audience while the single version does not.  On July 2\, 1996\, Varèse Sarabande rereleased this album on CD and included three bonus tracks\, all three of which were singles after the release of this album: "The Streak\," "The Moonlight Special\," and "Bridget the Midget (The Queen of the Blues)."	0

In my opinion\, Spivak\, Harry James\, & Billy Butterfield & a few others\, were probably some of the best "sweet" trumpet players to come out of the "Big Band Era" .  He started out in the early 1920's and by the time he formed his orchestra in 1939\, he had already played with such orchestra's fronted by \, Paul Specht\, Ben Pollack\, The Dorsey Brother's\, Bob Crosby\,  Tommy Dorsey\, & Jack Teagarden.  The Stardusters \, consisting of Glen Gaylon\, Curt Purnell\, & Dick Wylder started out as a trio while still in high school and upon graduation \, they decided to follow their dreams of a vocal career\, instead of attending Yale.  By 1939 and after several guest appearances\, they landed their very own radio program on NBC.  June Hutton \, Ina Ray Hutton's younger sister and once member of The Quintones vocal group\,   joined the original Stardusters in approx. 1940 and the group was complete.  They recorded WHEN I SEE AN ELEPHANT FLY\, AT LAST\, I SURRENDER DEAR\, A WEEKEND IN HAVANA\, THIS IS NO LAUGHING MATTER\, BROTHER BILL\, &  I REMEMBER YOU and a few others with Charlie Spivak's Orchestra. They later recorded with several popular vocalists of the day\, including  Evelyn Knight\, with whom they recorded the 1949 hit \, A LITTLE BIRD TOLD ME.	0
