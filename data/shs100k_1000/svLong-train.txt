COL title VAL Stella by Starlight COL performer VAL Frank Rosolino - Conte Candoli	COL video title VAL Earl Bostic -- Bugle Call Rag (VintageMusic.es) COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL 1913 -- 1965 El saxo alto Earl Bostic fue un auténtico master de su instrumento\, a pesar de ser infravalorado por los aficionados al jazz a causa de sus grabaciones de estilo jump que hiciera durante los años 50s y 60s.  Nacido en Tulsa\, Oklahoma\, Eugene Earl Bostic\, tocó por el territorio del Medio Oeste a principios de los años 30. Estudió en la Xavier University\, e hizo giras con varias bandas antes de trasladarse a New York en 1938. En esa ciudad tocó con Don Redman y Lionel Hampton\, con quien grabó su primer disco en 1939.  A principios de los años 40\, Bostic trabajó como arreglista y músico de sesión y formó su primera banda en 1945\, empezando a grabar regularmente consiguiendo su primer hit en 1948 con la pieza "Temptation". Enseguida firmó con la discográfica King\, la casa de la mayoría de sus éxitos de los jukebox\, que habitualmente se caracterizaba por un fuerte driving y un contagioso ritmo beat\, servido por el potente sonido del alto de Bostic en su faceta más romántica o agresiva y bluesy  En 1951\, Bostic consiguió un numero uno en las listas de éxitos con "Flamingo" al que siguieron varios más\, como "Sleep"\, "You Go to My Head" y "Cherokee". Por los grupos de Bostic desfilaron muchos jóvenes jazzmen tales como John Coltrane\, Blue Mitchell\, Benny Golson\, Stanley Turrentine\, Jaki Byard y otros muchos. Desgraciadamente\, Bostic sufrió un ataque al corazón a finales de los años 50s\, que le apartó de la música durante dos años. Regresó en 1959 pero no grabó tan extensamente y las sesiones de los 60s fueron más de corte Soul Jazz que de R&B.  Bostic murió de un fatal ataque al corazón mientras tocaba en un hotel de Rochester\, New York.

The critical success of the album Shotgun Willie (1973)\, combined with the critical and commercial success of Red Headed Stranger (1975) and Stardust (1978)\, made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music. He was one of the main figures of outlaw country\, a subgenre of country music that developed in the late 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the Nashville sound. Nelson has acted in over 30 films\, co-authored several books\, and has been involved in activism for the use of biofuels and the legalization of marijuana. #WillieNelson #"PleaseComeHomeForChristmas #CountryChristmas #Christmassong #RonjasCountryMusic #RonjaGM	0

Originally a French song by Margueritte Monnot entitled 'Le Goualante du Pauvre Jean' sung by Edith Piaf - roughly translated as 'The Popular Song of Poor John'. The music publisher mis-translated the French title into what we all know it as today - or so the story goes.......

On that very special night\, the Blind Boys invited some of their favorite musicians to join them: Dr. John\, Preservation Hall Jazz Band\, Henry Butler\, Marva Wright... and Susan Tedeschi.  The set list contained new and old favs -- selections from their New Orleans CD\, as well as songs from the Blind Boys' 4 Grammy-winning albums\, including the great soul-stirring classic\, "People Get Ready."  The packed crowd went wild\, and the whole unforgettable\, historic show was preserved forever on the DVD "The Blind Boys of Alabama - Live in New Orleans" -- from which this clip was taken.  I've always loved this song\, and I'd never heard it done this way. Imo\, it's Susan T. who makes this thing fly. That woman plays and sings like.... like the train really is a comin'! She's just a flat-out GREAT MUSICIAN\, in the purest sense.  Note: I made sure that the audio here is as good as it can possibly be. Ok. Enjoy.  (I claim no copyright ownership whatsoever to any of this material.)  Btw... Can you guess when the Blind Boys first sang together as a band? Hmmm. 1939. (Less than 4 score years after the Civil War!) Wow.	1

So let the wonder take you into space And lay you under its loving embrace Feel the thunder as it warms your face you can't hold back.  Just let your love flow like a mountain stream And let your love grow with the smallest of dreams And let your love show and you'll know what I mean\, it's the season	0

The critical success of the album Shotgun Willie (1973)\, combined with the critical and commercial success of Red Headed Stranger (1975) and Stardust (1978)\, made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music. He was one of the main figures of outlaw country\, a subgenre of country music that developed in the late 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the Nashville sound. Nelson has acted in over 30 films\, co-authored several books\, and has been involved in activism for the use of biofuels and the legalization of marijuana. #WillieNelson #"PleaseComeHomeForChristmas #CountryChristmas #Christmassong #RonjasCountryMusic #RonjaGM	0

COL title VAL You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To COL performer VAL Art Pepper	COL video title VAL Woody Herman - A Taste of Honey COL channel name VAL Erlendur Svavarsson COL description VAL On that ghastly afternoon when John F. Kennedy died\, Woody Herman was recording an album for Phillips. The band was playing Bobby Scott's "A Taste of Honey". Everyone had heard the news and there was in that performance a mournfulness that is not in the arrangement\, not in the notes themselves\, but in the attitude in the band\, whose personnel at that period included Nat Pierce\, Sal Nistico\, Phil Wilson\, and Bill Chase. You can hear it in the recording. It is a striking track\, deeply sad\, and it shows how jazz can reflect public events and the consequent more immediately than any other art. Woody finished the take and cancelled the rest of the date.	0

There was a time I would go to my brother I asked my brother\, "Will you help me please?" He turned me down and then I ask my dear mother\, oh I said "Mother!" I said "Mother! I'm down on my knees"   It's been a time that I thought Lord this couldn't last for very long But somehow I thought I was still able to try to carry on It's been a long\, long time coming But I know a change is gonna come Oh\, yes it is  Just like I said\, I went to my little bitty brother\, my littele brother I asked my brother "Brother help me please?" He turned me down and then I go to my little mother\, my dear mother I said "Mother!" I said "Mother!

COL title VAL Gigi COL performer VAL Robert Goulet	COL video title VAL The VelVet Underground Afterhours COL channel name VAL meremyaninays COL description VAL I simply love this song  lyrics  1-2-3  If you close the door\, the night could last forever  Keep the sunshine out and say hello to never  All the people are dancing and they're havin such fun  I wish it could happen to me  But if you close the door\, I'd never have to see the day again.   If you close the door\, the night could last forever\,  Leave the wineglass out and drink a toast to never  Oh\, someday I know someone will look into my eyes  And say hello -- you're my very special one--  But if you close the door\, I'd never have to see the day again.   Dark cloudy bars  Shiny Cadillac cars  And the people on subways and trains  Looking gray in the rain as they stand disarrayed  All the people look well in the dark  And if you close the door\, the night could last forever.  Leave the sunshine out and say hello to never  All the people are dancing and they're having such fun  I wish it could happen to me  'Cause if you close the door\, I'd never have to see the day again.  I'd never have to see the day again.  (once more)  I'd never have to see the day again.	0

COL description VAL Hi-res: http://www.soundliaison.com/   CD: https://carmengomes.bandcamp.com/   http://www.carmengomes.com/ ''Her style is bluesy and intimate with a sexy voice that's sweet as dark tupelo honey\, and her interpretations are unerring. this intimate effort is one of the best and best-sounding jazz vocal albums to come along in many a day.'' "I've seldom heard recordings that were so successful in both performance and sound aspects.'' quotes from Rad Bennett's review in the audiophile SoundStage! Magazine. Check out Carmen's new audiophile Studio Master Download  from the Sound Liaison label'.http://www.soundliaison.com/ Format: 24-bit/96kHz WAW(download) I've been among the prophets saying that high-resolution downloads are the future of audiophile music sales. Surely it will benefit the majors to make high-quality downloads a first choice rather than an MP3 extra\, but I believe that individual artists can benefit as well. Most new-to-the-scene performers have little money for middlemen and disc manufacture\, yet can get things together for the Internet.  Frans de Rond and Peter Bjørnild have taken this approach with Sound Liaison\, producing recordings available only in 24-bit/96kHz downloads that mirror the master recording. And man\, are they ever sweet. I've seldom heard recordings that were so successful in both performance and sound aspects.  De Rond hails from the Netherlands\, where he studied double bass at The Royal Conservatory in The Hague while concurrently studying recording techniques. Bjørnild also studied double bass\, moving to the Netherlands to continue studies at The Hague. Since graduating\, he has played almost every type of music\, from classical to jazz. Together de Rond and Bjørnild bring two pairs of golden ears to their label. Bjørnild claims that\, "a recording should be as realistic and beautiful sounding as possible. As if\, when closing your eyes\, you find yourself in the best seat in the hall."  The partners discovered a fine recording hall (Studio-Eleven\, Hilversum) and set out to record amazing musicians in this great acoustic place in front of live audiences. It's a daring feat; one take and no place to hide\, but the abilities of the musicians involved make it seem easy. I chose to talk about the first album by Carmen Gomes Inc. It was a tough choice because all of the three current albums were worthy of review.  Carmen Gomes has won many awards in the Netherlands and surrounding areas. Like so many new European singers\, she sings in English -- excellent English\, I might add. She's formed a group called Carmen Gomes Inc.\, with Folker Tettero on guitar\, Peter Bjørnild on double bass\, and Marcel van Engelen on drums. Her style is bluesy and intimate with a sexy voice that's sweet as dark tupelo honey\, and her interpretations are unerring. The musicians play to her and to each other\, and the ensemble is so tight that the four musicians breathe and move as one.  There are some standards on the set that knocked me over with their fresh approach. Any singer can misplace a few accents and rhythms and come up with something that's original\, but perhaps also uneasy and a little strange. Not Gomes\, who has taken the songs to their bones and then restructured them to suit her style. Thus "Fever" doesn't sound like a cover of Peggy Lee; it sounds like a brand new take on a familiar song. You emerge from hearing it not thinking it's better or lesser than Lee's version\, but that it's a valid new interpretation that could have come first.  The same approach works on "Angel Eyes\," "You Don't Know What Love Is\," and "I'm on Fire." Most of the rest\, including the title song\, "Oblivion\," "Time Will Tell\," "Gasoa Blue\," and "The Sea\," are Gomes originals that fit right in with the standards. The recording achieves exactly what Bjørnild set out as his goal. It can provide the best seat in your listening room. Go to the Sound Liaison site\, listen to a few samples\, download an album\, and see if you don't agree that this intimate effort is one of the best and best-sounding jazz vocal albums to come along in many a day. By the way\, the small audience applauds enthusiastically enough after the last chords of a song die away\, but the attendees never interrupt or make themselves known while a song is going on. No doubt they were completely mesmerized into silence\, as was I.  Be sure to listen to: On "Dock of the Bay\," Gomes creates a languid\, bluesy version that is a little bit reminiscent of Bobbie Gentry while still coming across as quite original. It'll cast a spell over you.  . . . Rad Bennett radb@soundstagenetwork.comradb@soundstagenetwork.com	0

COL title VAL La estrella azul COL performer VAL Paty Cantú	COL video title VAL Gustav Winckler - Når du ser et stjerneskud (When You Wish Upon a Star) COL channel name VAL stigekalder COL description VAL ★★★ My playlist with Gustav Winckler Christmas songs: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFD92160049A76D3B  Gustav Winckler (1925 - 1979): NÅR DU SER ET STJERNESKUD  This is the Danish version of "When You Wish Upon a Star"\, which was written by Ned Washington and Leigh Harline and introduced in the 1940 Walt Disney movie Pinocchio\, where it is sung by Cliff Edwards.   In Denmark (as in the other Nordic countries + Japan)\, the song has become a Christmas song\, often referring to the Star of Bethlehem. The Danish title roughly translates as "When you see a shooting star". The song is played on television every Christmas Eve's day in the traditional Disney one-hour Christmas cabaret\, and the gathering of the entire family for the watching of this\, is considered a Nordic tradition.  Når du ser et stjerneskud lad dit ønske flyve ud\, da vil alle stjerners herre  høre dig. Bare du af hjertet tror\, da er ingen bøn for stor når et stjerneskud\, der falder  på din vej.  Skæbnen selv er da din lykkes smed\, den blinker til dig ned fra himlens stjerner.  Når du ser et stjerneskud\, da er det et himlens bud om at du skal vinde\, hvad du ønsker dig.  (Danish version by Mogens Dam)  Gustav Winckler was a popular Danish singer\, composer and music publisher. He is widely considered the best Danish crooner ever\, and was often compared to Bing Crosby. In 1957 after qualifying in "Dansk Melodi Grand Prix" to represent Denmark at the Eurovision Song Contest\, he participated in Eurovision Song Contest 1957 where he sung "Skibet skal sejle i nat" ("The ship is leaving tonight") with Birthe Wilke. They ranked number 3\, and stunned television audiences with a 13-second long kiss at the end of their performance. Winckler died in a car accident in 1979.

"I've seldom heard recordings that were so successful in both performance and sound aspects.'' quotes from Rad Bennett's review in the audiophile SoundStage! Magazine. Check out Carmen's new audiophile Studio Master Download  from the Sound Liaison label'.http://www.soundliaison.com/ Format: 24-bit/96kHz WAW(download) I've been among the prophets saying that high-resolution downloads are the future of audiophile music sales. Surely it will benefit the majors to make high-quality downloads a first choice rather than an MP3 extra\, but I believe that individual artists can benefit as well. Most new-to-the-scene performers have little money for middlemen and disc manufacture\, yet can get things together for the Internet.  Frans de Rond and Peter Bjørnild have taken this approach with Sound Liaison\, producing recordings available only in 24-bit/96kHz downloads that mirror the master recording. And man\, are they ever sweet. I've seldom heard recordings that were so successful in both performance and sound aspects.  De Rond hails from the Netherlands\, where he studied double bass at The Royal Conservatory in The Hague while concurrently studying recording techniques. Bjørnild also studied double bass\, moving to the Netherlands to continue studies at The Hague. Since graduating\, he has played almost every type of music\, from classical to jazz. Together de Rond and Bjørnild bring two pairs of golden ears to their label. Bjørnild claims that\, "a recording should be as realistic and beautiful sounding as possible. As if\, when closing your eyes\, you find yourself in the best seat in the hall."  The partners discovered a fine recording hall (Studio-Eleven\, Hilversum) and set out to record amazing musicians in this great acoustic place in front of live audiences. It's a daring feat; one take and no place to hide\, but the abilities of the musicians involved make it seem easy. I chose to talk about the first album by Carmen Gomes Inc. It was a tough choice because all of the three current albums were worthy of review.  Carmen Gomes has won many awards in the Netherlands and surrounding areas. Like so many new European singers\, she sings in English -- excellent English\, I might add. She's formed a group called Carmen Gomes Inc.\, with Folker Tettero on guitar\, Peter Bjørnild on double bass\, and Marcel van Engelen on drums. Her style is bluesy and intimate with a sexy voice that's sweet as dark tupelo honey\, and her interpretations are unerring. The musicians play to her and to each other\, and the ensemble is so tight that the four musicians breathe and move as one.  There are some standards on the set that knocked me over with their fresh approach. Any singer can misplace a few accents and rhythms and come up with something that's original\, but perhaps also uneasy and a little strange. Not Gomes\, who has taken the songs to their bones and then restructured them to suit her style. Thus "Fever" doesn't sound like a cover of Peggy Lee; it sounds like a brand new take on a familiar song. You emerge from hearing it not thinking it's better or lesser than Lee's version\, but that it's a valid new interpretation that could have come first.  The same approach works on "Angel Eyes\," "You Don't Know What Love Is\," and "I'm on Fire." Most of the rest\, including the title song\, "Oblivion\," "Time Will Tell\," "Gasoa Blue\," and "The Sea\," are Gomes originals that fit right in with the standards. The recording achieves exactly what Bjørnild set out as his goal. It can provide the best seat in your listening room. Go to the Sound Liaison site\, listen to a few samples\, download an album\, and see if you don't agree that this intimate effort is one of the best and best-sounding jazz vocal albums to come along in many a day. By the way\, the small audience applauds enthusiastically enough after the last chords of a song die away\, but the attendees never interrupt or make themselves known while a song is going on. No doubt they were completely mesmerized into silence\, as was I.  Be sure to listen to: On "Dock of the Bay\," Gomes creates a languid\, bluesy version that is a little bit reminiscent of Bobbie Gentry while still coming across as quite original. It'll cast a spell over you.  . . . Rad Bennett radb@soundstagenetwork.comradb@soundstagenetwork.com	0

It is an arrangement of (and an "answer song" to) Bo Diddley's "I'm a Man" (which in turn was inspired by Waters' and Willie Dixon's "Hoochie Coochie Man"). "Mannish Boy" features a repeating stop-time figure on one chord throughout the song and is credited to Waters\, Mel London\, and Bo Diddley.  Muddy Waters versions  The original version of "Mannish Boy" was recorded in Chicago on May 24\, 1955\, under the title "Manish Boy." Accompanying Muddy Waters on vocals and guitar were Jimmy Rogers on guitar\, Junior Wells on harmonica\, Fred Below on drums\, and an un-identified female chorus. The original version was the only recording done by Muddy Waters between January 1953 and June 1957 that did not feature Little Walter on harmonica and was one of few studio recordings with Junior Wells.  Muddy Waters recorded several versions of "Mannish Boy" during his career. In 1968\, he recorded it for the Electric Mud album in Marshall Chess' attempt to attract the rock market. After he left Chess\, he recorded it for the 1977 Hard Again album which was produced by Johnny Winter. The song also was included on the live album Muddy "Mississippi" Waters - Live (1979).  Charts and accolades  The song reached #5 during a stay of six weeks in the Billboard R&B chart. The song was Muddy Waters only chart appearance on the UK Singles Chart peaking at #51.  In 1986\, Muddy Waters' original "Mannish Boy" was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame "Classics of Blues Recordings" category. It was also included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's list of the "500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll". "Mannish Boy" is ranked #229 in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the "500 Greatest Songs of All Time".  Cover versions  A cover by Jimi Hendrix appears on the compilation album Blues.  Paul Butterfield covered the song in 1986 on his album The Legendary Paul Butterfield Rides Again.  It was covered by Hindu Love Gods in their album of the same name.  The song also appears on The Bocephus Box\, a three-CD box set by Hank Williams\, Jr.\, released in 2000.  Elliott Murphy covered it in 2005 on Murphy gets Muddy.  The Rolling Stones have often incorporated this song\, among other blues standards\, into their live set\, and it can be heard on the albums Love You Live and Rarities 1971-2003.  Wolfmother did a cover of the song for their special edition version of Cosmic Egg.  Black Stone Cherry performed a heavier version along with Hoochie Coochie Man in October 2009 at Rockaplast in Germany.  It was further rearranged in the 2003 Martin Scorsese documentary film series titled The Blues. In the fifth film\, titled Godfathers and Sons and directed by Marc Levin\, Mannish Boy was redone by The ElectriK Mud Kats (a.k.a. The Electric Mud Band\, Muddy Waters' backing group from his album Electric Mud) with vocals by hip hop artists Chuck D\, Common & Kyle Jason.  Roger Daltrey performed a cover of the song on Jools Holland's New Years show on December 31\, 2010.  A version of the song recorded by Erykah Badu was featured in an H&M TV advert in spring 2011.  Aerosmith performed the song on The Howard Stern Show on January 13\, 1995.	0

COL title VAL Naima COL performer VAL Massimo Urbani	COL video title VAL Gerry Gibbs - 2015 - Live In Studio - 10 Cast Your Fate To The Wind COL channel name VAL JazzTube COL description VAL Personnel Kenny Barron: piano Ron Carter: acoustic bass Gerry Gibbs: drums  Composers Vince Guaraldi  Drummer Gerry Gibbs has been living a recurring dream with slight variations for the past few years. In December of 2012\, he laid down tracks with two of his idols—the legendary Ron Carter and the estimable Kenny Barron—and dubbed their group the Thrasher Dream Trio. The eponymous debut from that band\, featuring fifteen tracks recorded at those sessions\, was\, not surprisingly\, a strong and classy affair filled with standards\, some originals\, and other jazz-friendly fare\, such as Stevie Wonder's "Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing" and Burt Bacharach's "Promises\, Promises."   At the time of that album's release\, those last-mentioned tracks could simply be viewed as part of the well-rounded program. But looking back now\, it actually seems like they were dropped as hints of what was to come. About a year-and-a-half after that first Thrasher Dream Trio album was recorded\, Gibbs brought the band together again to lay things down for We're Back (Whaling City Sound\, 2014)\, a jazz-does-R&B project with A-list guests—vibraphonist Warren Wolf\, saxophonist Steve Wilson\, and organist Larry Goldings. That album offered multiple helpings of Wonder and Earth\, Wind & Fire along with single servings of Bacharach\, Marvin Gaye\, Miles Davis\, and the Average White Band. As on the trio's first album\, the sparks were flying. The playing field\, however\, had changed a bit.   For this\, the third go-around for this group\, Gibbs does it again\, tweaking the formula without altering the essence of the trio. This time he turned the focus toward pop-ish material from the '50s and '60s—the work of Bacharach\, Henry Mancini\, Michel Legrand\, and others of that ilk—and put an audience in front of the band\, recording live at Systems Two Recording Studio. Guests are part of the package again—now it's trumpeter Roy Hargrove and vocalist Cassandra Wilson\, each appearing on a few tracks—and they help to add another wrinkle or two to the project without drawing focus away from the trio.   The album opens on a fluid "Wives And Lovers" that allows Barron's lyricism to shine through\, gives Carter a chance to step into the spotlight\, and puts Gibbs' brushwork at center stage. From there\, the trio moves on with an unusually upbeat take on "The Summer Knows\," a Wilson-enhanced version of "The Look Of Love" that moves from bossa nova to swing\, and a variety of other familiar hits of yesteryear. Hargrove joins in for "On A Clear Day\," quoting Ellington at one point and playfully trading solos with Gibbs; Vince Guaraldi's cheerfulness shines through on a perky trio performance of his "Cast Your Fate To The Wind"; "More" is transformed from a stale confection into an enjoyable swinger; and "Watch What Happens" happens twice—first as a cheerful\, Brazilian-based instrumental\, then as a swing-centered feature for Wilson.   Along the way there are plenty of other bright spots—an appropriately noir-ish "What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life?" with Hargrove on flugelhorn\, a leisurely stroll through "Girl Talk"—and plenty of moments that serve as simple reminders as to why Barron and Carter are loved\, respected\, and emulated the world over. Their time and taste are impeccable\, and when married to Gibbs' in-the-tradition drumming\, you know the music is going to go in the right direction every time.

It takes a great singer to really do justice to Dylan\, yet KT goes well beyond that and makes this her own. She's just that good live.  I work nights in a television studio and used to come home in the morning to find absolutely nothing interesting to watch on television. The last thing I wanted to see was more commercials. And I'm not really interested in watching talk shows and soap operas.  Then I discovered the commercial free music channel RAVE. HD quality video and pretty much perfect 5.1 sound. A few times a week they run "Later With Jools Holland" in the morning. Jools has great taste in music and each show runs the gamut from pop\, rock\, folk\, Celtic\, African\, to Joanna Newsome. Something for everyone. Suffice to say I love this show.  Uploaded as a high quality 640 x 480 MPEG4 file using Pinnacle Studio.

Alden and Raymond B. Egan Music by Ange Lorenzo and Richard Whiting Performed by The Manhattan Dance Makers Recorded November 11\, 1925 Harmony H-63  The Manhattan Dance Makers was a Ben Selvin group that recorded for the Harmony and Columbia labels between 1925 and 1929. The group\, at times\, included Earl Oliver\, Hymie Faberman\, Nathan Glantz\, Bennie Krueger\, Harry Reser\, Joe Tarto\, George Hamilton Green.   In 1923 an amateur songwriter\, Joseph Alden\, showed band director\, Ange Lorenzo some lyrics he had written with the title "Sleepy Time Girl."  Lorenzo sat down at the piano\, and in a short time composed the music to go with it.  Even though it was an immediate hit it remained unpublished until composer Richard Whiting and lyricist Ray Egan heard the song and recognized its potential.  They polished it up a little then renamed it "Sleepy Time Gal" and had it published in 1925.  "Sleep Time Gal" has enjoyed many years of popularity through the years. Among the many performers include: The Three Suns\, Herb Alpert\, Tony Bennett\, Pery Como\, Dean Martin\, Dinah Shore\, Les Elgart\, Harry James\, Jerry Vale\, Liberace\, Guy Lombardo\, Norman Luboff\, Mills Brothers\, and Oscar Peterson.  Ange Lorenzo died in 1971\, at the age of 77.  At the funeral\, his long-time friend\, musician Bill Kempf\, played a sang a final tribute to Lorenzo\, "Sleepy Time Gal."  = = = = = = =  (verse 1) Wouldn't it be a change for you and me to stay at home once in a while? We cabaret until the break of day\, I'll bet we've danced many a mile. I'd like to see a movie once more\, They don't keep people stayin' up until four. Wouldn't it be a pleasant novelty to tumble in early once more?  (chorus) Sleepy time gal\, you're turning night into day\, Sleepy time gal\, you've danced the ev'ning away\, Before each silvery star fades out of sight\, Please give me one little kiss\, then let us whisper "goodnight\," It's gettin' late and dear your pillow's waitin'; Sleepy time gal\, when all your dancin' is thru\, Sleepy time gal\, I'll find a cottage for you\, You'll learn to cook and to sew\, What's more you'll love it\, I know\, When you're a stay-at-home\, play-at-home\, Eight o'clock sleepy time gal.  (verse 2) Wouldn't it be a pleasant sight to see a kitchenette only for you? Wouldn't it be a pleasant sight to see\, a table set only for two? I'll get a big Victrola and then\, We'll start in dancing ev'ry new dance again\, Then it will be a pleasant novelty to tumble in just about ten.  (chorus)	0

Seals and Croft released the original in 1970\, the single reaching a respectable number 6 in the charts.

COL title VAL Hør min sang\, Violetta COL performer VAL Per Müller	COL video title VAL The Beatles - A Taste Of Honey COL channel name VAL DeutschMatheLehrer COL description VAL The Beatles - A Taste Of Honey (Copyright 1963 EMI Records)  "A Taste of Honey" is a pop standard written by Bobby Scott and Ric Marlow. It was originally an instrumental track (or recurring theme) written for the 1960 Broadway version of the 1958 British play A Taste of Honey (which was also made into a film with the same name in 1961). Both the original and a cover by Herb Alpert in 1965 earned the song Grammy Awards. A vocal version of the song\, first recorded by Lenny Welch\, became popular when it was recorded by The Beatles in 1963.  The original recorded versions of the song ("A Taste of Honey"\, "A Taste of Honey (refrain)" and "A Taste of Honey (closing theme)" appeared on Bobby Scott's 1960 album\, also titled A Taste of Honey\, on Atlantic Records (Atlantic 1355). After being used in the film\, the composition won Best Instrumental Theme at the Grammy Awards of 1962.  Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass recorded the most popular instrumental version of this song with a cover on their 1965 album\, Whipped Cream & Other Delights. This recording spent five weeks at #1 on the adult contemporary chart\, reached #7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart\, and won three awards including Record of the Year at the Grammy Awards of 1966.  Martin Denny and The Victor Feldman Quartet each scored minor hits in 1962 with their covers.  Acker Bilk released a version in the UK in January 1963\, reaching #16 in the UK Singles Chart.  Paul Desmond recorded it on his album Glad to be Unhappy in 1963.  Lenny Welch recorded the first vocal version. It was released as a single in September 1962 on the Cadence label and included on his 1963 album Since I Fell for You. This version also credits Lee Morris as a writer but it is not known if it was he who provided the lyrics. This credit does not appear on any covers of the song\, with only Marlow/Scott credited.  Allan Sherman recorded a parody version called "A Waste of Money".   In other news\, I have added the lyrics to this song so you can sing along\, or perhaps learn the song! This is how I learned my first Beatles song! Enjoy! :)  Album: Introducing The Beatles Recorded: February 11\, 1963	0

COL title VAL What Is This Thing Called Love? COL performer VAL Michel Legrand & His Orchestra	COL video title VAL BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band COL channel name VAL JohnMcEuenMusic COL description VAL Music and lyrics by Jimmy Driftwood:   Jimmy Driftwood was a high school principal and history teacher who loved to sing\, play instruments and write songs. Mr. Driftwood wrote many songs\, all for the sole purpose of helping his students learn about this battle and other historical events. But this song turned out to be so popular that it won the 1959 Grammy Award for Song Of The Year (awarded in 1960 for musical accomplishments in 1959). Johnny Horton also won the 1959 Grammy Award for Best Country And Western Performance for his recording of this song. "The Battle of New Orleans\," is about a battle in the War of 1812\, and it became one of the biggest selling hits of 1959.   After the Battle of New Orleans\, which Andrew Jackson won on January the 8th eighteen and fifteen\, the boys played the fiddle again that night\, only they changed the name of it from the battle of a place in Ireland to the Eighth of January. Years passed and in about nineteen and forty-five an Arkansas school teacher slowed the tune down and put words to it and that song is The Battle Of New Orleans and I will try to sing it for you.   Well\, in eighteen and fourteen we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississip. We took a little bacon and we took a little beans\, And we caught the bloody British near the town of New Orleans.  We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin. There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago. We fired once more and they began to runnin' down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.  Well\, I see'd Mars Jackson walkin down the street talkin' to a pirate by the name of Jean Lafitte [pronounced La-feet] He gave Jean a drink that he brung from Tennessee and the pirate said he'd help us drive the British in the sea.  The French said Andrew\, you'd better run\, for Packingham's a comin' with a bullet in his gun. Old Hickory said he didn't give a dang\, he's gonna whip the britches off of Colonel Packingham.  We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin. There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago. We fired once more and they began to runnin' down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.  Well\, we looked down the river and we see'd the British come\, and there must have been a hundred of 'em beatin' on the drum. They stepped so high and they made their bugles ring while we stood by our cotton bales and didn't say a thing.  Old Hickory said we could take 'em by surprise if we didn't fire a musket til we looked 'em in the eyes. We held our fire til we see'd their faces well\, then we opened up with squirrel guns and really gave a yell.  We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin. There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago. We fired once more and they began to runnin' down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.  Well\, we fired our cannon til the barrel melted down\, so we grabbed an alligator and we fought another round. We filled his head with cannon balls and powdered his behind\, and when they tetched the powder off\, the gator lost his mind.  We'll march back home but we'll never be content till we make Old Hickory the people's President. And every time we think about the bacon and the beans\, we'll think about the fun we had way down in New Orleans.  We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin\, But there wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago. We fired once more and they began to runnin' down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.  Well\, they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go. They ran so fast the hounds couldn't catch 'em down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.  We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin. But there wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago. We fired once more and they began to runnin' down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.	0

COL title VAL How Deep Is the Ocean? COL performer VAL Bill Evans Trio	COL video title VAL ELIO PACE - You Never Can Tell (from the album 'Come And Get It' 2002) 4 of 16 COL channel name VAL rosarecordsonline COL description VAL 'You Never Can Tell' was written and originally recorded by Chuck Berry.  _________________________  A message from Elio...  The original concept behind 'Come And Get It'\, was to produce a high quality demo for me and my band to use as promotion with a view to attracting bigger and better corporate work as a 'covers band'. It was never intended for commercial release. Proving this point\, the original two-thousand CDs pressed in February 2002\, had no barcode on the artwork.  In fact\, the idea (going into the first day of recording) was to record only segments of 10 or 12 songs and to create a five-minute showreel. It was only just as recording was about to commence that Darren Loveday (one of two guitarists in the band at the time and my co-producer on the project) suggested that for the time it took to decide which segment of each song should be recorded\, we may as well play the whole song from start to finish\, especially as we all knew the songs so well\, having played them so many times. It was only when listening back the following day to the 13-tracks we'd recorded\, that Darren and I decided to create a full album of the material.  It was also decided that along with the 13 'new' songs\, we should make use of the 74-minutes available on CD (at the time) and include; a previous demo we'd made in 1998 of Billy Joel's 'My Life'; a live stereo recording (off MiniDisc\, with a few overdubs) of Jerry Lee Lewis' 'Great Balls Of Fire' from August 2000; and demos of three original songs I'd written (Addicted To The Phone\, Got The Bug Back and Katy Likes House) which would eventually be re-recorded and released on my 2009 'debut' album\, 'A Seat At My Table.  The last item that we decided to include on this original 19-track album was a 1998 demo we had recorded of Delbert McClinton's 'Two More Bottles Of Wine'. Ironically\, it was THIS little track (with just myself on piano\, Darren on guitar and the both of us doing the backing vocals and hand-claps) that realised the original concept for this album and opened a huge door for me in my career. Sir Terry Wogan and the late Paul Walters\, working together on BBC Radio 2's 'Wake Up To Wogan'\, played my version of 'Two More Bottles Of Wine' on their show\, once a week for six-months\, from August 2003. It was the first time that one of my recordings had been played on national radio in the UK. I really wasn't prepared for it as I didn't even have a website at the time.  I eventually got my act together and although casually stocked in a hand-full of small record shops\, 'Come And Get It' (on my own label\, Rosa Records) became available to buy in 2005 on CD via my website and then released to the general public as a download in 2007. This digital release and the subsequent CD pressings does not include the three demos of my songs... for obvious reasons. Now discontinued\, you would have to hunt down one of the original batch of those two-thousand CDs pressed in February 2002.  By the way\, the billing as 'The Elio Pace Band' was purely to guarantee that prospective clients knew that they were not booking just an individual at a piano and to differentiate between my two 'hats' as a performer; a) playing 'dance party' covers and b) playing my own material\, for which I would simply be known as Elio Pace. Interestingly\, Terry Wogan never once announced my record as 'The Elio Pace Band'. Instead he always referred to me as "Elio Pace and his band". 'Come And Get It' was the first and only album that will have 'The Elio Pace Band' as the artist name although I fully expect to record another album of covers sometime in the future.  _________________________  Track listing:  1.

Quand il me prend dans ses bras\, Qu'il me parle tout bas\, Je vois la vie en rose; Il me dit des mots d'amour\, Des mots de tous les jours\, Et ça m' fait quelque chose. Il est entré dans mon coeur\, Une part de bonheur Dont je connais la cause\, C'est lui pour moi\, moi pour lui dans la vie; Il me l'a dit\, l'a juré pour la vie; Et dès que je l'aperçois\, Alors je sens en moi Mon coeur qui bat.  Des nuits d'amour à plus finir\, Un grand bonheur qui prend sa place\, Les ennuis\, les chagrins trépassent... Heureux\, heureux à en mourir!	0

If you close the door\, the night could last forever\,  Leave the wineglass out and drink a toast to never  Oh\, someday I know someone will look into my eyes  And say hello -- you're my very special one--  But if you close the door\, I'd never have to see the day again.   Dark cloudy bars  Shiny Cadillac cars  And the people on subways and trains  Looking gray in the rain as they stand disarrayed  All the people look well in the dark  And if you close the door\, the night could last forever.  Leave the sunshine out and say hello to never  All the people are dancing and they're having such fun  I wish it could happen to me  'Cause if you close the door\, I'd never have to see the day again.  I'd never have to see the day again.  (once more)  I'd never have to see the day again.	0

As a second line of attack he decamped to his home with a pile of recording equipment and a few friends to record a series of tongue in cheek cover version.  Randy Stonehill introduces the songs in the style of an OTT egotistical West Coast DJ\, The Surf Duke\, and frankly this has some hysterically funny moments!  Their acoustic version of Norman Greenbaum's "Spirit In The Sky" is absolutely hilarious!  Larry's imitation of Mick Jagger on the Stones' "Shine A Light" is outrageous and the segue of "Bridge Over Troubled Water"\, "Let It Be" and "My Sweet Lord" is suitably respectful . until we get to the disco break in the latter song and Larry again adopting Mick Jagger mode starts singing\, "I'm So Bored".  Call me iconoclastic but these songs deserve to be ripped apart!  After the Clapton rumors of conversion which surface every five years or so\, "Presence Of The Lord" is given a straight rendition although it's worth bearing in mind Larry reports that Clapton wrote it to express escaping from the police who wanted to bust him for drugs!  This CD release closes with two bonus tracks which did not appear on the original vinyl release.  This time they're introduced by Larry's Big Bomber DJ alter-ego on Radio K.R.A.P. and include another great Mick Jagger impersonation on "I Am Waiting".  Mischievous yet making an important contribution cataloguing counterfeit "Christian" culture.  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Larry's Site: http://www.larrynorman.com/ ----------------------------------------------------------------	1

Volare \, Never On Sunday\, Old Cape Cod COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Richard "Billy Vaughn" (el 12 de abril de 1919 - el 26 de septiembre de 1991) era un cantante\, multiinstrumentista\, y líder de orquesta. Él nació en Glasgow\, Kentucky\, donde su padre era un barbero que amó la música e inspiró a Billy y le enseñó  tocar la mandolina a la edad de 3 años cuando padecía  un caso de la sarampión. Él continuó aprendiendo varios otros instrumentos.  En 1941 Vaughn se afilió a la Guardia Nacional de los Estados Unidos para lo que había sido preparado como una cesión de un año\, pero cuando la Segunda Guerra Mundial estalló\, le enviaron al extranjero hasta el final la guerra  en 1945.  Él decidió hacer de la música su carrera cuando él fue licenciado del ejército al final de guerra\, y asistió al Colegio de Estado de Kentucky Occidental\, ahora conocido como la Universidad de Kentucky Occidental.  Mientras él estaba un estudiante allí\, otros tres compañeros\, Jimmy Sacca\, Donald McGuire\, y Seymour Spiegelman\, que habían formado un trío vocal\, el Hilltoppers\, reclutaron a Vaughn para tocar el piano con ellos. Él pronto añadió su voz \, convirtiendo el trío en un cuarteto. Como  miembro del grupo\, él también escribió su primera canción \, Tentativa\, que charted en 1952.  En 1954 dejó el grupo para afiliarse a Archivos de Punto en Gallatin\, Tennessee como el director de música. Posteriormente formó su propia orquesta\, y tuvo un gran éxito en aquel mismo año "con la Melodía del Amor." Continuó cosechando éxitos  durante la próxima década y media. Vaughn murió del cáncer en Palomar\, California el 26 de septiembre\, { El 26 de septiembre} 1991.

COL title VAL Heart and Soul COL performer VAL The Spaniels	COL video title VAL California Ramblers Wally Edwards Orch. - Peanut Vendor 1930 El Manisero COL channel name VAL warholsoup100 COL description VAL Peanut vendor 12-2-1930. 1930 California Ramblers. Columbia 2351 Columbia DC104. First recording of this song by a U.S. group. Yes\, it's the Ramblers\, not the usual sound you might think. The California Ramblers were a popular and prolific jazz group from the 1920s\, that recorded hundreds of songs under many different record labels throughout the 1920s. Three of the members of the band\, Red Nichols\, Jimmy Dorsey\, and Tommy Dorsey\, would go on to front big bands in later decades. The original bandmembers were from Ohio\, but chose the name California Ramblers because they thought people would be less inclined to listen to a jazz band from the Midwest. The Peanut Vendor (original title: El Manisero) is a Cuban song based on a street-seller's cry\, and known as a pregón. It is possibly the most famous piece of music created by a Cuban musician. The Peanut Vendor has been recorded more than 160 times\, sold over a million copies of the sheet music\, and was the first million-selling 78rpm of Cuban music.	0

COL title VAL A Taste of Honey COL performer VAL Quincy Jones	COL video title VAL Woody Herman - A Taste of Honey COL channel name VAL Erlendur Svavarsson COL description VAL On that ghastly afternoon when John F. Kennedy died\, Woody Herman was recording an album for Phillips. The band was playing Bobby Scott's "A Taste of Honey". Everyone had heard the news and there was in that performance a mournfulness that is not in the arrangement\, not in the notes themselves\, but in the attitude in the band\, whose personnel at that period included Nat Pierce\, Sal Nistico\, Phil Wilson\, and Bill Chase. You can hear it in the recording. It is a striking track\, deeply sad\, and it shows how jazz can reflect public events and the consequent more immediately than any other art. Woody finished the take and cancelled the rest of the date.	1

COL title VAL Dock of the Bay COL performer VAL David Allan Coe	COL video title VAL Michel Legrand Orchestra - What is this Thing Called Love - El Choclo - Perfidia (Stereo) COL channel name VAL ifcopod COL description VAL Perfidia  that imperishable song  we all whistle daily  enjoyed a vogue  recently . Many \,mainly rock music poseurs  touting versions ~   Of course  if Perfidia is given special treatment why not Stairway to the Stars or some such delightful marginalised  standard. Can you think of others  I can. Out of this World.for one.  There's a good Mantovani 1949 version before the famous cascading strings. In fact we could put  infinity to the test lining up whole catalogues of  meritorious songs and some  not quite so. .    This  Perfidia is buried somewhere on the 18 minutes track but all the music  is worth a listen. Interestingly when  Legrand recorded his Cole Porter  double album in 1957 a fullyfledged orchestral version of  What is this thing called love was omitted. 1962s Strings on Fire made amends with  my favourite version of the song and   a stylish reading affording  space for the legrand strings to shine. Depending on where the punctuation is the title reads What is this Thing Called? -- Love? or said in frustration What is this Thing Called Love?  In 1956  Legrand recorded  the album Castles in Spain which included a dapper take on El Choclo complete with a sprightly concertante piano part. This version from Strings on Fire is even better and  eloquent evidence that when he approaches songs afresh  for a  different slant on the melody he has few rivals among the arranger brigade.  There's a mono version of Perfidia by Michel Legrand doing the rounds on YouTube for headphone listening the stereo pressing makes a big difference. The selection of Orchestras typical of  1950s 1960s  music Bert Kaemfert Billy Vaughan ~ did you know Billy Vaughan was a massive seller in the 1950s  my favourite Billy Vaughan  is still Friendly Persuasion  with Pat Boone  you cant really beat that quality of melody written by  respected hero  Dimitri Tiomkin  among the most melodically   gifted of all film composers. Check  his Unforgiven   music from  Burt Lancaster 1960 movie and  from the same time Sundowners  .Both extremely attractive difficult to call it between them. . Strings on Fire.  has a stylish elegance  and classical sweep  that put It above  American orchestral albums of similar vintage but always keep   a flag flying for strings maestro  Percy Faith.	0

COL title VAL Avalon COL performer VAL Art Hickman & His Orchestra	COL video title VAL François Glorieux plays The Beatles - 11 - In My Life (Debussy) COL channel name VAL François Miet COL description VAL Improvisation on "In my life" in the style of Claude Debussy. La plus grande originalité de cet étonnant LP réside sans doute dans le fait que chaque pièce a été entièrement improvisée. En d'autres termes : jouée spontanément sans préparation\, ni partition. Si François Glorieux est le seul pianiste de notre XXè siècle à s'être aventuré aussi loin dans le domaine de l'improvisation\, il ne révèle ici qu'UN des des multiples aspects de ce "grand art" qu'il pratique comme personne : l'improvisation de style. Et cela tient du miracle! Loin de se contenter d'un "pastiche à la manière de ..."\, il nous démontre comment les noms illustres de l'histoire de la musique auraient pu traiter les admirables mélodies des Beatles. Certains thèmes ont été reproduits intégralement\, d'autres ont été légèrement modifiés ou adaptés à l'image même du compositeur! Et on chercherait en vain un défaut de style ou de construction\, une faute de goût\, une lacune. Comme le disait si bien un critique musical allemand : " François Glorieux est en quelque sorte le faux-monnayeur de l'improvisation\, car c'est si parfait\, si réussi\, qu'on ne sait s'il joue le vrai ou le faux."	0

COL title VAL I've Never Been to Me COL performer VAL The Temptations	COL video title VAL Los Hang Tens - Till The End Of The Day (The Kinks) COL channel name VAL Heduardo COL description VAL Antes que nada debo agradecer a Elmo Lesto http://youtu.be/LIwhRq4RrI0\, ya que fue el primero en subir a Youtube un tema de Los Hang Tens. Es que desde hace mucho tiempo solo teníamos de este grupo una pequeña foto borrosa y una reseña en inglés que subió George Bonilla al sitio http://www.incarock.com. Yo nunca los había escuchado.  En 1964\, Diego García Sayán\, los hermanos José y Freddy Rizo Patrón\, Ramón Orbegoso y Felipe Larrabure\, formaron Los Hang Tens (1964-1968). Ellos eran compañeros de estudios del colegio Santa María en el distrito San Isidro. "Una banda que se formó sin la pretensión de convertirse en grupo profesional\, pues el principal propósito era reunirse para disfrutar de la música y entretener a sus amigos en fiestas y funciones escolares"\, dice Bonilla. Según esta misma referencia\, ellos (como ya muchos en el mundo) habían caído bajo el influjo de la llamada "invasión británica": Beatles\, Rolling Stones\, Kinks\, Yarbirds\, Dave Clark Five\, Animals\, Herman Hermits\, etc. También participaron en el grupo Manuel Sanguinetti\, Juan de Aliaga\, Jaime Sabal y Guillermo Pérez Argüello\, remplazando o alternándose con los fundadores. La popularidad del grupo atrajo la atención del sello Odeon\, que les propuso grabar un 45 rpm\, que ahora se ha convertido en pieza de colección: "Till the end of the day" (del grupo The Kinks) en el lado A y "These boots were made for walking" (que popularizara Nancy Sinatra) en el lado B. El disco salió en 1966. En 1967\, los hermanos Rizo Patrón y Manuel Sanguinetti ya planeaban crear un grupo de mayores proyecciones: Traffic Sound. Pero esa ya es otra historia (y qué historia).	0

COL title VAL Love Potion #9 COL performer VAL Rinder & Lewis	COL video title VAL Ella Fitzgerald - How Deep Is The Ocean COL channel name VAL arqags79 COL description VAL How Deep Is The Ocean  foi composta em  1932\, sendo Ella Fitzgerald uma das várias interpretes a cantá-la.  Irving Berlin é provavelmente o nome mais conhecido do cancioneiro popular norte-americano. Suas composições também se caracterizam por ser completas\, isto é\, letra e música. Foi um dos mais prolíficos compositores\, tendo escrito quase 900 músicas.  How Deep Is The Ocean (How High Is The Sky)  How much do I love you? I'll tell you no lie How deep is the ocean? How high is the sky? How many times in a day Do I think of you? How many roses are Sprinkled with dew?  How far would I travel Just to be where you are? How far is the journey From here to a star? And if I ever lost you How much would I cry? How deep is the ocean? How high is the sky?  Tradução  Quão Profundo É o Oceano (Quão Alto É o Céu)  quanto eu te amo? eu lhe direi a verdade quão profundo é o oceano? quão alto é o céu? quantas vezes\, em um dia\, eu penso em você? quantas rosas são salpicadas de orvalho?  a que distância eu viajaria só para estar onde você estivesse? qual é a distância de uma viagem daqui até as estrelas? e se eu lhe perdesse para sempre? quanto eu choraria? quão profundo é o oceano? quão alto é o céu?	0

COL title VAL Never My Love / Ask the Lonely COL performer VAL Eivets Rednow	COL video title VAL KT Tunstall "Tangled Up In Blue" Jools Holland RAVE HD COL channel name VAL HiHo44 COL description VAL This is KT Tunstall covering the Bob Dylan tune "Tangled Up In Blue" on "Later With Jools Holland". It takes a great singer to really do justice to Dylan\, yet KT goes well beyond that and makes this her own. She's just that good live.  I work nights in a television studio and used to come home in the morning to find absolutely nothing interesting to watch on television. The last thing I wanted to see was more commercials. And I'm not really interested in watching talk shows and soap operas.  Then I discovered the commercial free music channel RAVE. HD quality video and pretty much perfect 5.1 sound. A few times a week they run "Later With Jools Holland" in the morning. Jools has great taste in music and each show runs the gamut from pop\, rock\, folk\, Celtic\, African\, to Joanna Newsome. Something for everyone. Suffice to say I love this show.  Uploaded as a high quality 640 x 480 MPEG4 file using Pinnacle Studio.

As a second line of attack he decamped to his home with a pile of recording equipment and a few friends to record a series of tongue in cheek cover version.  Randy Stonehill introduces the songs in the style of an OTT egotistical West Coast DJ\, The Surf Duke\, and frankly this has some hysterically funny moments!  Their acoustic version of Norman Greenbaum's "Spirit In The Sky" is absolutely hilarious!  Larry's imitation of Mick Jagger on the Stones' "Shine A Light" is outrageous and the segue of "Bridge Over Troubled Water"\, "Let It Be" and "My Sweet Lord" is suitably respectful . until we get to the disco break in the latter song and Larry again adopting Mick Jagger mode starts singing\, "I'm So Bored".  Call me iconoclastic but these songs deserve to be ripped apart!  After the Clapton rumors of conversion which surface every five years or so\, "Presence Of The Lord" is given a straight rendition although it's worth bearing in mind Larry reports that Clapton wrote it to express escaping from the police who wanted to bust him for drugs!  This CD release closes with two bonus tracks which did not appear on the original vinyl release.  This time they're introduced by Larry's Big Bomber DJ alter-ego on Radio K.R.A.P. and include another great Mick Jagger impersonation on "I Am Waiting".  Mischievous yet making an important contribution cataloguing counterfeit "Christian" culture.  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Larry's Site: http://www.larrynorman.com/ ----------------------------------------------------------------	1

Their first release\, the April 1959 single "Rockin' Blues" b/w "Midnight Party"\, came out under the name The Del-Tones\, but the group changed their name soon afterward in a nod to the Bomarc missile. Their breakthrough hit was "Clap Your Hands"\, which hit #1 in Canada and Australia\,[1] and peaked at #45 on the US Billboard pop charts[2] and #40 on Cashbox.[3] The tune was also released in French as "Frappe Tes Mains". Their debut\, ten-track full-length came out in 1960; they appeared on American Bandstand and at a charity concert at Carnegie Hall soon afterward. Two more albums followed before the group broke up in 1963; a 1968 reunion saw "Clap Your Hands" get a re-release.	1

The critical success of the album Shotgun Willie (1973)\, combined with the critical and commercial success of Red Headed Stranger (1975) and Stardust (1978)\, made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music. He was one of the main figures of outlaw country\, a subgenre of country music that developed in the late 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the Nashville sound. Nelson has acted in over 30 films\, co-authored several books\, and has been involved in activism for the use of biofuels and the legalization of marijuana. #WillieNelson #"PleaseComeHomeForChristmas #CountryChristmas #Christmassong #RonjasCountryMusic #RonjaGM	0

COL title VAL I Ain't Got Nobody COL performer VAL The Four Knights	COL video title VAL Vera Lynn - We'll Meet Again (1939 Novachord Version) COL channel name VAL Travis Bickle COL description VAL Thanks to Kim Damien Eriksen for pointing out (in his very informative comment) that in fact this is a '39 version of the song\, and thanks to Aidan The Lover Boy O'Dwyer too for reminding me to check the comments. "We'll Meet Again" is song made famous by British singer Vera Lynn with music and lyrics written by Ross Parker and Hughie Charles (born Charles Hugh Owen Ferry\, 24 Jul 1907 in Reddish\, Stockport\, Cheshire). The song is one of the most famous songs of the Second World War era\, and resonated with soldiers going off to fight and their families and sweethearts. The assertion that "we'll meet again" is optimistic\, as many soldiers did not survive to see their loved ones again. Indeed\, the meeting place at some unspecified time in the future would have been seen by many who lost loved ones to be heaven.	0

COL title VAL Who Do You Love COL performer VAL The Druids of Stonehenge	COL video title VAL Michel Legrand Orchestra - What is this Thing Called Love - El Choclo - Perfidia (Stereo) COL channel name VAL ifcopod COL description VAL Perfidia  that imperishable song  we all whistle daily  enjoyed a vogue  recently . Many \,mainly rock music poseurs  touting versions ~   Of course  if Perfidia is given special treatment why not Stairway to the Stars or some such delightful marginalised  standard. Can you think of others  I can. Out of this World.for one.  There's a good Mantovani 1949 version before the famous cascading strings. In fact we could put  infinity to the test lining up whole catalogues of  meritorious songs and some  not quite so. .    This  Perfidia is buried somewhere on the 18 minutes track but all the music  is worth a listen. Interestingly when  Legrand recorded his Cole Porter  double album in 1957 a fullyfledged orchestral version of  What is this thing called love was omitted. 1962s Strings on Fire made amends with  my favourite version of the song and   a stylish reading affording  space for the legrand strings to shine. Depending on where the punctuation is the title reads What is this Thing Called? -- Love? or said in frustration What is this Thing Called Love?  In 1956  Legrand recorded  the album Castles in Spain which included a dapper take on El Choclo complete with a sprightly concertante piano part. This version from Strings on Fire is even better and  eloquent evidence that when he approaches songs afresh  for a  different slant on the melody he has few rivals among the arranger brigade.  There's a mono version of Perfidia by Michel Legrand doing the rounds on YouTube for headphone listening the stereo pressing makes a big difference. The selection of Orchestras typical of  1950s 1960s  music Bert Kaemfert Billy Vaughan ~ did you know Billy Vaughan was a massive seller in the 1950s  my favourite Billy Vaughan  is still Friendly Persuasion  with Pat Boone  you cant really beat that quality of melody written by  respected hero  Dimitri Tiomkin  among the most melodically   gifted of all film composers. Check  his Unforgiven   music from  Burt Lancaster 1960 movie and  from the same time Sundowners  .Both extremely attractive difficult to call it between them. . Strings on Fire.  has a stylish elegance  and classical sweep  that put It above  American orchestral albums of similar vintage but always keep   a flag flying for strings maestro  Percy Faith.	0

As a second line of attack he decamped to his home with a pile of recording equipment and a few friends to record a series of tongue in cheek cover version.  Randy Stonehill introduces the songs in the style of an OTT egotistical West Coast DJ\, The Surf Duke\, and frankly this has some hysterically funny moments!  Their acoustic version of Norman Greenbaum's "Spirit In The Sky" is absolutely hilarious!  Larry's imitation of Mick Jagger on the Stones' "Shine A Light" is outrageous and the segue of "Bridge Over Troubled Water"\, "Let It Be" and "My Sweet Lord" is suitably respectful . until we get to the disco break in the latter song and Larry again adopting Mick Jagger mode starts singing\, "I'm So Bored".  Call me iconoclastic but these songs deserve to be ripped apart!  After the Clapton rumors of conversion which surface every five years or so\, "Presence Of The Lord" is given a straight rendition although it's worth bearing in mind Larry reports that Clapton wrote it to express escaping from the police who wanted to bust him for drugs!  This CD release closes with two bonus tracks which did not appear on the original vinyl release.  This time they're introduced by Larry's Big Bomber DJ alter-ego on Radio K.R.A.P. and include another great Mick Jagger impersonation on "I Am Waiting".  Mischievous yet making an important contribution cataloguing counterfeit "Christian" culture.  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Larry's Site: http://www.larrynorman.com/ ----------------------------------------------------------------	0

Brunswick Records LA1730 8250\, 1938.  From the movie Thanks for the Memories.  Here we are\, don;t we look a mess~lipstick on your collar\, wrinkles in my dress Two sleepy people who've known very well\, they're too much in love to break the spell Here we are\, crazy in the head\, gee your eyes are gorgeous\, even when they're red Two sleepy people by dawn's early light and too much in love to say goodnight Do you remember when we went dancing at the Palomar? When it was over why naturally we cuddled in the car. So you ran out of gas and I was green as grass Here we are keeping up the pace Letting each tomorrow slap us in the face Two sleepy people by dawn's early light And too much in love to say goodnight.	0

COL title VAL Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This) COL performer VAL Eurythmics	COL video title VAL Earl Bostic -- Bugle Call Rag (VintageMusic.es) COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL 1913 -- 1965 El saxo alto Earl Bostic fue un auténtico master de su instrumento\, a pesar de ser infravalorado por los aficionados al jazz a causa de sus grabaciones de estilo jump que hiciera durante los años 50s y 60s.  Nacido en Tulsa\, Oklahoma\, Eugene Earl Bostic\, tocó por el territorio del Medio Oeste a principios de los años 30. Estudió en la Xavier University\, e hizo giras con varias bandas antes de trasladarse a New York en 1938. En esa ciudad tocó con Don Redman y Lionel Hampton\, con quien grabó su primer disco en 1939.  A principios de los años 40\, Bostic trabajó como arreglista y músico de sesión y formó su primera banda en 1945\, empezando a grabar regularmente consiguiendo su primer hit en 1948 con la pieza "Temptation". Enseguida firmó con la discográfica King\, la casa de la mayoría de sus éxitos de los jukebox\, que habitualmente se caracterizaba por un fuerte driving y un contagioso ritmo beat\, servido por el potente sonido del alto de Bostic en su faceta más romántica o agresiva y bluesy  En 1951\, Bostic consiguió un numero uno en las listas de éxitos con "Flamingo" al que siguieron varios más\, como "Sleep"\, "You Go to My Head" y "Cherokee". Por los grupos de Bostic desfilaron muchos jóvenes jazzmen tales como John Coltrane\, Blue Mitchell\, Benny Golson\, Stanley Turrentine\, Jaki Byard y otros muchos. Desgraciadamente\, Bostic sufrió un ataque al corazón a finales de los años 50s\, que le apartó de la música durante dos años. Regresó en 1959 pero no grabó tan extensamente y las sesiones de los 60s fueron más de corte Soul Jazz que de R&B.  Bostic murió de un fatal ataque al corazón mientras tocaba en un hotel de Rochester\, New York.

COL title VAL Soul Serenade/Rasta Man Chant COL performer VAL The Derek Trucks Band	COL video title VAL The Carpenters - Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas (A&M Records 1978) COL channel name VAL ChristmasTimeTV COL description VAL "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" is a song introduced by Judy Garland in the 1944 MGM musical Meet Me in St. Louis. Frank Sinatra later recorded a version with modified lyrics\, which has become more common than the original. The song was written by Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane.  When presented with the original draft lyric\, Garland\, her co-star Tom Drake and director Vincente Minnelli criticized the song as depressing\, and asked Martin to change the lyrics. Though he initially resisted\, Martin made several changes to make the song more upbeat. For example\, the lines "It may be your last / Next year we may all be living in the past" became "Let your heart be light / Next year all our troubles will be out of sight". Garland's version of the song\, which was also released as a single by Decca Records\, became popular among United States troops serving in World War II; her performance at the Hollywood Canteen brought many soldiers to tears.  In 1957\, Frank Sinatra asked Martin to revise the line "Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow". He told Martin\, "The name of my album is A Jolly Christmas. Do you think you could jolly up that line for me?" Martin's new line was "Hang a shining star upon the highest bough". Martin made several other alterations\, changing the song's focus to a celebration of present happiness\, rather than anticipation of a better future. On The Judy Garland Show Christmas Special\, Judy sings the song to her children Joey and Lorna Luft with Sinatra's alternate lyrics.  Have yourself a merry little Christmas  Let your heart be light  From now on  our troubles will be out of sight  Have yourself a merry little Christmas  Make the Yule-tide gay  From now on  our troubles will be miles away   Here were are as in olden days  happy golden days of yore  Faithful friends who are dear to us  gather near to us once more   Through the years we all will be together  If the Fates allow  Hang a shining star upon the highest bough  And have yourself a merry little Christmas now	0

Why should our magical moments of madness Be leaving me with such a feeling of sadness? I know I am playing a forbidden game For the girl that I love is not sharing my name.  There isn't anything special about her But try as I may\, life means nothing without her Perhaps I'm a fool to be hoping in vain But I know that I'm playing a forbidden game.  No one can tell me how long love will last If the future will bring me much more than the past Should I show her I worry? I don't think I dare When my happiness lies in each moment we share.  I'll go on loving her\, just as before For she's all that I want\, and I ask nothing more And if things should go wrong\, I must take all the blame For you're bound to get hurt playing forbidden games.	0

Long may his legacy live through his movies\, his many recordings\, videos on YouTube and through other media outlets. His voice may never be equaled.  This music was first published as a waltz called "Sobre las olas" ("Over the Waves") in 1888 written by Juventino P. Rosas.

Making the transition from B/W to full colour to coincide with Bogle's words "We started all over again\," I wanted to show how war is part of our past\, present and (unfortunately) future.

Mildred Bailey (February 27\, 1907 -- December 12\, 1951) was a popular and influential American jazz singer during the 1930s\, known as "The Rockin' Chair Lady" and "Mrs. Swing". Her number one hits were "Please Be Kind"\, "Darn That Dream"\, "Rockin' Chair" and "Says My Heart". In the mid 1930s\, she recorded with her third husband Red Norvo. A dynamic couple\, they earned the nicknames "Mr. and Mrs. Swing". During this period (1936--1939) Norvo recorded for Brunswick (with Bailey as primary vocalist) and Bailey recorded her own set of recordings for Vocalion\, often with Norvo's band. Some of her recordings instead featured members of Count Basie's band. Despite her divorce from Norvo\, she and Red would continue to record together until 1945. Suffering from diabetes and depression (during her adult life Bailey was overweight)\, she only made a few recordings following World War II.  Mildred Bailey died December 12\, 1951\, in Poughkeepsie\, New York\, of heart failure\, aged 44\, chiefly due to her diabetes. Her ashes were scattered. Red Norvo outlived Bailey by nearly half a century\, dying in April 1999\, a week after his 91st birthday. "I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You" is a 1932 song composed by Victor Young\, with lyrics written by Ned Washington and Bing Crosby\, recorded on October 14\, 1932 by Bing Crosby in New York. In 1939\, Mildred Bailey fronted a six-side\, mostly blues session as "Mildred Bailey and her Oxford Greys" for Vocalion\, which featured a small mixed-race combo of Mary Lou Williams (piano)\, Floyd Smith (electric guitar)\, John Williams (bass) and Eddie Dougherty (drums).	0

As a second line of attack he decamped to his home with a pile of recording equipment and a few friends to record a series of tongue in cheek cover version.  Randy Stonehill introduces the songs in the style of an OTT egotistical West Coast DJ\, The Surf Duke\, and frankly this has some hysterically funny moments!  Their acoustic version of Norman Greenbaum's "Spirit In The Sky" is absolutely hilarious!  Larry's imitation of Mick Jagger on the Stones' "Shine A Light" is outrageous and the segue of "Bridge Over Troubled Water"\, "Let It Be" and "My Sweet Lord" is suitably respectful . until we get to the disco break in the latter song and Larry again adopting Mick Jagger mode starts singing\, "I'm So Bored".  Call me iconoclastic but these songs deserve to be ripped apart!  After the Clapton rumors of conversion which surface every five years or so\, "Presence Of The Lord" is given a straight rendition although it's worth bearing in mind Larry reports that Clapton wrote it to express escaping from the police who wanted to bust him for drugs!  This CD release closes with two bonus tracks which did not appear on the original vinyl release.  This time they're introduced by Larry's Big Bomber DJ alter-ego on Radio K.R.A.P. and include another great Mick Jagger impersonation on "I Am Waiting".  Mischievous yet making an important contribution cataloguing counterfeit "Christian" culture.  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Larry's Site: http://www.larrynorman.com/ ----------------------------------------------------------------	0

The music was written by Vincent Rose\, the lyrics by [John L. Rooney]. It was recorded six times in 1940. Victor Records released the recording by the Sammy Kaye Orchestra with vocals by Tommy Ryan on May 31\, 1940 (catalog #26643\, with the flip side "Maybe"; matrix #51050). Gene Krupa's version was issued on the Okeh label (#5672) on June 3. Other 1940 recordings were by: Glenn Miller on Bluebird (10768)\, Kay Kyser\, Russ Morgan\, Gene Autry (also in the 1941 film The Singing Hill)\, Connee Boswell\, and Jimmy Dorsey. The largest 1940 hit was by Glenn Miller.  Louis Armstrong's 1949 recording charted in the Billboard Top 40. It was an international hit in 1956 for Fats Domino\, and has become a rock and roll standard. It reached number two\, for three weeks on the Billboard Top 40 charts\, becoming his biggest pop hit\, and spent eight non-consecutive weeks at number one on the R&B Best Sellers chart. The version by Fats Domino was also ranked #81 in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. The song was Domino's greatest hit and remains the song most associated with him.

(the first line of Domino's 1950s version of "Blueberry Hill") in reference to pretty girls he dated or wanted to date.  It is one of the songs that the time traveling James Cole enjoys in the film\, Twelve Monkeys\, and the song is later sung by the scientists upon his return to the future.  The song is purportedly named after a "make-out" spot in Taos\, New Mexico.  Joe Edwards' restaurant on the Delmar Loop in St. Louis\, Missouri\, where Chuck Berry frequently plays\, is named after the song.  The Far Side\, a comic written by Gary Larson\, features a comic parodying the lyrics of this song. A man is talking in a phone booth on top of a hill named "Blueberry Hill." He says into the phone "Norm? This is Mitch. ... You were right--I found my drill." The parody is of the line "found my thrill on Blueberry Hill."  Prime Minister of Russia Vladimir Putin made a cover performance of the song on December 10\, 2010 before an audience of international film and television celebrities\, in support of a charity for ill children. Videos of his performance quickly went viral worldwide.	1

COL title VAL Call Me COL performer VAL Alexander Stewart	COL video title VAL Sarah Vaughan - How High The Moon (Live @ Mister Kelly's Chicago) 1957 COL channel name VAL RoundMidnightTV COL description VAL "How High the Moon" is a jazz standard with lyrics by Nancy Hamilton and music by Morgan Lewis. It was first featured in the 1940 Broadway revue Two for the Show\, where it was sung by Alfred Drake and Frances Comstock.  In "Two for the Show"\, this was a rare serious moment in an otherwise humorous revue. The song was sung\, in a slow fox trot tempo\, by a group of evening-dressed people walking along a London street. At the end\, they all looked at the sky\, and cowered\, obviously terrified: quick curtain. It was 1940\, and the time of the London blitz: a clear night meant "bomber's moon".  The earliest recorded hit version was by Benny Goodman & His Orchestra. It was recorded February 7\, 1940 and released by Columbia Records as catalog number 35391\, with the flip side "Fable of the Rose". The Les Paul Trio recorded a version released as V-Disc 540B with a spoken introduction which was issued in November\, 1945 by the U.S. War Department. In 1948\, bandleader Stan Kenton enjoyed some success with his version of the tune. The recording\, with a vocal by June Christy\, was released by Capitol Records as catalog number 911 (with the flip side "Willow\, Weep for Me") and 15117(with the flip side "Interlude"). It reached the Billboard magazine Best Seller chart on July 9\, 1948\, its only week on the chart\, at #27.  The best-known recording of the song is by Les Paul and Mary Ford\, made on January 4\, 1951. The record was released by Capitol Records as catalog number 1451\, with the flip side "Walkin' and Whistlin' Blues"\, and spent 25 weeks (beginning on March 23\, 1951) on the Billboard chart\, 9 weeks at #1. The record was subsequently re-released by Capitol as catalog number 1675\, with "Josephine" on the B-side.  The song was sung in various recordings by Ella Fitzgerald\, becoming (with the Gershwin's "Oh\, Lady Be Good!") Ella's signature tune. She first performed the song at Carnegie Hall on September 29\, 1947. Her first recording\, backed by the Daydreamers\, was recorded December 20\, 1947 and released by Decca Records as catalog number 24387\, with the flip side "You Turned the Tables on Me". Her most celebrated recording of "How High the Moon" is on her 1960 album Ella in Berlin\, and her version was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2002\, which is a special Grammy award established in 1973 to honor recordings that are at least twenty-five years old\, and that have "qualitative or historical significance."  "At Mister Kelly's" is a 1957 live album by American jazz singer Sarah Vaughan\, recorded at Mister Kelly's jazz club in Chicago. The Allmusic review by John Bush awarded the album four and a half stars and said that At Mister Kelly's captures Vaughan at her "best and most relaxed"\, stating that "her unerring sense of rhythm carries her through every song on this set\, whether the occasion calls for playfulness and wit ("Thou Swell\," "Honeysuckle Rose") or a world-wise melancholia ("Willow Weep for Me")".

GET HERE Music and Lyrics\, Brenda Russell  You can reach me by railway\, you can reach me by trailway You can reach me on an airplane\, you can reach me with your mind You can reach me by caravan\, cross the desert like an Arab man I don't care how you get here\, just- get here if you can  You can reach me by sailboat\, climb a tree and swing rope to rope Take a sled and slide down slow\, into these arms of mine You can jump on a speedy colt\, cross the border in a blaze of hope I don't care how you get here\, just- get here if you can  There are hills and mountains between us Always something to get over If I had my way\, then surely you would be closer I need you closer  You can windsurf into my life\, take me up on a carpet ride You can make it in a big balloon\, but you better make it soon You can reach me by caravan\, cross the desert like an Arab man I don't care how you get here\, just- get here if you can  I don't care\, I dont care\, I need you right here right now I need you right here\, right now\, right by my side I don't care how you get here\, just- get here if you can.  "Get Here" is a pop ballad written by American singer/songwriter Brenda Russell which became an international hit via a 1990 recording by Oleta Adams\, reaching #4 in the UK and #5 (#8 R&B) in the US.  Brenda Russell had written the song while staying at a penthouse in Stockholm: the tune came to her as she viewed some hot air balloons floating over the city\, a sight Russell recalls set her "really tripping on how many ways you can get to a person" (the eventual song's lyrics include the line: "You can make it in a big balloon but you'd better make it soon"). Although Russell did not pursue the musical ideas that came to her as her current record label saw her as a dance artist and she thought would not be interested in a song such as the one which became "Get Here"\, the song was still in the singer's mind when she woke up the next day: "I don't read or write music [therefore] it's extraordinary if a song is still in my head that I haven't jotted down or recorded. So if it's still in my head overnight\, I think that's something extra special\, it's like somebody trying to tell me something." Russell recorded the song as the title cut of her 1988 album from which it was issued as a single - the album's third - reaching the Top 40 on the Billboard R&B charts.  It was while Oleta Adams was visiting Stockholm that she heard the original Brenda Russell version of "Get Here" playing in a record store and was sufficiently impressed with the song to record it for her 1990 debut album Circle of One. Adams' "Get Here" was issued as a single - after two previous tracks from Circle of One had been released to scant notice - in November 1990; world events at this time gave the song a resonance as an anthem for the US troops in the Gulf War - underscored by the lyrics: "You can reach me by caravan|Cross the desert like an Arab man" - which impelled Adams' single into the Top Ten of the Billboard Hot 100 in the spring of 1991 .  A signature number of Justin Guarini during season #1 of American Idol and included on the Justin Guarini album\, "Get Here" has also been recorded by Vanessa Amorosi\, Paul Anka\, David Archuleta\, Alexia Gardner\, Barbara Mandrell\, Omar Chakil (who wrote French lyrics for his version: "Tu m'as tout donné ")\, Q featuring Tracey Ackerman\, Jennifer Rush\, Livingston Taylor and Jonalyn Viray. A humorous cover\, which featured comedy sound effects after each method of transport mentioned\, was performed by fictional singer Michelle Coffee in the Peter Kay series Phoenix Nights.  The Beautiful South's album Gaze included a song with the same title and\, partially\, similar lyrics - but reversed the theme\, with Paul Heaton protesting his unwillingness to travel any distance at all for his lover. (Sample lyric: "You can get here by helicopter"/"I can barely make Blackpool sands").

COL title VAL The Wreck of the Old 97 COL performer VAL New River Express	COL video title VAL The Kingston Trio - MTA COL channel name VAL John1948SevenE COL description VAL The Kingston Trio's place in the sun was etched in stone virtually from the get-go. The band formed in 1957 and by the following year had a very successful single called "Tom Dooley" resting atop the pop charts. The trio\, though certainly more commercially viable than some of the more authentic folkies of the late '50s\, had a lot to do with the success of the folk revival in that era; folk music rang out from college campuses everywhere in the late '50s and '60s as the genre's left-leaning stylists were part of the evolving changing social atmosphere in America. Whether or not they knew their music was paving the way for artists more deeply involved in these changes (Bob Dylan\, Joan Baez)\, it did sell plenty of records. And the folk revival of this era mirrored the Depression-era folk music of Woody Guthrie\, Leadbelly\, Josh White and others. The '60s genre took on the Vietnam War to rail against. The Kingston Trio began in San Francisco with Bob Shane (b. 1934)\, Nick Reynolds (b. 1933) and Dave Guard (1934-1991) joining forces. Their first album\, THE KINGSTON TRIO\, included "Tom Dooley" and it was played so much by DJs that Capitol released it as a single that eventually sold nearly 3 million records. The song as written by Guard was taken from a 19th century mountain ballad about Tom Dula\, who was hanged for murdering his sweetheart. Several albums ensued for the trio\, all doing well commercially but\, while it had 10 singles charted by 1963\, only "Reverend Mr. Black" got into the Top 10. However\, the Kingston Trio is remembered for other tuneslike "M.T.A.\," "The Tijuana Jail\," "A Worried Man" and "Greenback Dollar." Meanwhile\, Guard opted for a solo career in 1961\, his replacement being John Stewart (b. 1939)\, who stayed until 1967\, when he embarked on a solo career that in 1979 put three singles in the charts with his "Gold" reaching No. 5. As the more intensive folk-rock grew\, making folkies like the Kingston Trio old-fashioned\, the trio\, now Roger Gamble\, George Grove and Shane\, broke up in 1968. A TV reunion in 1981 had all six members together for the first time. In 1987\, the Trio was put back together with Shane\, Grove and Bob Haworth recreating it all for nostalgia audiences.

COL title VAL Keep On Running COL performer VAL The Spencer Davis Group	COL video title VAL Ladi Geisler - Java COL channel name VAL Socratess2007 COL description VAL It was a huge instrumental hit for trumpet player Al Hirt back in 1964\, this Allen Toussaint's "Java".  Toussaint wrote the tune in 1958 for an album that would be released by RCA and Toussaint's studio recording did quite well in the easy listening charts.  But Al Hirt's trumpet version did even better : it was on the no1 position (easy listening) for several weeks.  Hirt also won a Grammy Award in the category "Best instrumentalist or orchestra".  Here Bert Kaempfert's "knack bass specialist" Ladi Geisler brings us his guitar version and\, even if  the arrangement stays quite close to the original one\, the mere fact of using a guitar to play the lead theme works remarkably refreshing. From his 2002 album "Those were the days" here is Ladi Geisler with "Java".  Enjoy !	0

In Denmark (as in the other Nordic countries + Japan)\, the song has become a Christmas song\, often referring to the Star of Bethlehem. The Danish title roughly translates as "When you see a shooting star". The song is played on television every Christmas Eve's day in the traditional Disney one-hour Christmas cabaret\, and the gathering of the entire family for the watching of this\, is considered a Nordic tradition.  Når du ser et stjerneskud lad dit ønske flyve ud\, da vil alle stjerners herre  høre dig. Bare du af hjertet tror\, da er ingen bøn for stor når et stjerneskud\, der falder  på din vej.  Skæbnen selv er da din lykkes smed\, den blinker til dig ned fra himlens stjerner.  Når du ser et stjerneskud\, da er det et himlens bud om at du skal vinde\, hvad du ønsker dig.  (Danish version by Mogens Dam)  Gustav Winckler was a popular Danish singer\, composer and music publisher. He is widely considered the best Danish crooner ever\, and was often compared to Bing Crosby. In 1957 after qualifying in "Dansk Melodi Grand Prix" to represent Denmark at the Eurovision Song Contest\, he participated in Eurovision Song Contest 1957 where he sung "Skibet skal sejle i nat" ("The ship is leaving tonight") with Birthe Wilke. They ranked number 3\, and stunned television audiences with a 13-second long kiss at the end of their performance. Winckler died in a car accident in 1979.

In 1923\, Fain appeared with Artie Dunn in a short film directed by Lee De Forest filmed in DeForest's Phonofilm sound-on-film process. In 1925\, Fain left the Fain-Dunn act to devote himself to music. Fain was a self-taught pianist who played by ear. He began working as a staff pianist and composer for music publisher Jack Mills.  Fain also composed music for more than 30 films in the 1930s\, 40s and 50s. He was nominated for the best Original Song Oscar nine times\, winning twice\, with "Secret Love" from Calamity Jane in 1954 and with "Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing" from the movie of the same title in 1955. He co-wrote both songs with Paul Francis Webster\, another long-time collaborator. Fain wrote the second theme to the TV series Wagon Train in 1958\, which was called "(Roll Along) Wagon Train". He also contributed to the song scores for the Walt Disney animated films Alice in Wonderland\, Peter Pan\, and The Rescuers.  In 1963\, he collaborated with Harold Adamson in writing songs for the movie The Incredible Mr. Limpet\, which came out in 1964\, and such songs as "I Wish I Were a Fish"\, "Be Careful How You Wish" and "Deep Rapture" enhanced his fame.  Fain died in 1989 in Los Angeles\, California\, and is interred at Cedar Park Cemetery\, in Emerson\, New Jersey.  "Love Me or Leave Me" was written by Walter Donaldson and the lyrics by Gus Kahn. The song was introduced in the Broadway play\, Whoopee!\, which opened in December 1928 and closed n November 1929. Ruth Etting's performance of the song was so popular that she was also given the song to sing in the play Simple Simon\, which opened in February 1930.  The song was not included in the MGM film version of Whoopee! which was released in 1930.	0

I Can't Make You Love Me has music and lyrics by Mike Reid and Allen Shamblin. Performed by Leslie Henstock. Band: Andrew Byrne (piano/musical director)\, Micah Burgess (guitar)\, Ray Cetta (bass)\, and Tim Lykins (drums). Co-producer: David Alan Thornton. Videographer: Karen Marshall.  People You May Know Cabaret Series This concept was born of our shared desires to explore and celebrate new composing artists\, sing both new and familiar music\, and explore the degrees of separation (or lack thereof) in this business. The evening combines the songs of our featured 3 writers along with the familiar songs and composers that have been influential to their work. By including traditional influences that have shaped the musical theatre genre along with today's most exciting music\, we hope to broaden the concept of the "Great American Songbook".  The process works like this: we chose 3 contemporary theatre writers who excite us\, and explore their repertoire for songs that we would like to sing. Simultaneously\, we contact those writers to learn from them their musical\, lyrical\, and stylistic influences. And also get approval for songs of theirs we want to sing\, see if there is something specific they want us to feature\, etc. Once we have all of these songs collected\, we try to put these myriad musical ideas together in a way that is innovative and fun. We may do some mash-ups\, a medley or two\, or something completely different!	0

It takes a great singer to really do justice to Dylan\, yet KT goes well beyond that and makes this her own. She's just that good live.  I work nights in a television studio and used to come home in the morning to find absolutely nothing interesting to watch on television. The last thing I wanted to see was more commercials. And I'm not really interested in watching talk shows and soap operas.  Then I discovered the commercial free music channel RAVE. HD quality video and pretty much perfect 5.1 sound. A few times a week they run "Later With Jools Holland" in the morning. Jools has great taste in music and each show runs the gamut from pop\, rock\, folk\, Celtic\, African\, to Joanna Newsome. Something for everyone. Suffice to say I love this show.  Uploaded as a high quality 640 x 480 MPEG4 file using Pinnacle Studio.

COL title VAL Feel Like Making Love COL performer VAL Ely Bruna feat. Frankie Lovecchio	COL video title VAL Glen Campbell - The Christmas Song (Merry Christmas To You) Capitol Records 1968 COL channel name VAL ChristmasTimeTV COL description VAL "The Christmas Song" (commonly subtitled "Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire" or\, as it was originally subtitled\, "Merry Christmas to You") is a classic Christmas song written in 1944 by musician\, composer\, and vocalist Mel Tormé and Bob Wells. According to Tormé\, the song was written during a blistering hot summer. In an effort to "stay cool by thinking cool\," the most-performed (according to BMI) Christmas song was born. The Nat King Cole Trio first recorded the song early in 1946. At Cole's behest — and over the objections of his label\, Capitol Records — a second recording was made the same year utilizing a small string section\, this version becoming a massive hit on both the pop and R&B charts. Cole again recorded the song in 1953\, using the same arrangement with a full orchestra arranged and conducted by Nelson Riddle\, and once more in 1961\, in a stereophonic version with orchestra conducted by Ralph Carmichael. Nat King Cole's 1961 version is generally regarded as definitive\, and in 2004 was the most loved seasonal song with women aged 30--49\, while Cole's original 1946 recording was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1974.   Chestnuts roasting on an open fire  Jack Frost nipping at your nose  Yuletide carols being sung by a choir  And folks dressed up like Eskimos   Everybody knows a turkey and some  Mistletoe help to make the season bright  Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow  Will find it hard to sleep tonight   They know that Santa's on his way  He's loaded lots of toys and goodies  On his sleigh  And every mother's  Child is gonna spy to see if  Reindeer really know how to fly   And so\, I'm offering this  Simple phrase to kids from  One to ninety-two  Altho' it's been said many times  Many ways  "Merry Christmas to you"	0

COL title VAL Corpo e alma COL performer VAL Kleiton & Kledir	COL video title VAL Larry Norman - Bridge Over Troubled Water - [Paul Simon Cover] COL channel name VAL Larry Norman COL description VAL Visit My Site: http://larrynormanlyrics.com ----------------------------------------------------------- Larry Norman - Bridge Over Troubled Water ~ (Cover) ~ Track 3 (Words and Music: Paul Simon)  From the Album "Streams Of White Light Into Darkened Corners" ~ (Solid Rock Records 1977) ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Personnel: • Larry Norman: Vocals\, Guitar\, Percussion\, and Piano • Randy Stonehill: Introduces each song as a West Coast DJ\, The Surf Duke\, Guitar\, backing vocals • Charles Norman: Guitars ---------------------------------------------------------------------- In the early 70's\, frustrated by the music industry's intention to dilute the impact of Jesus rock through the many religious songs that mainstream artists chose to record and the fallacious rumors that celebrities like Clapton had been saved\, Larry Norman wrote various hard hitting features that magazines and papers wouldn't print.  As a second line of attack he decamped to his home with a pile of recording equipment and a few friends to record a series of tongue in cheek cover version.  Randy Stonehill introduces the songs in the style of an OTT egotistical West Coast DJ\, The Surf Duke\, and frankly this has some hysterically funny moments!  Their acoustic version of Norman Greenbaum's "Spirit In The Sky" is absolutely hilarious!  Larry's imitation of Mick Jagger on the Stones' "Shine A Light" is outrageous and the segue of "Bridge Over Troubled Water"\, "Let It Be" and "My Sweet Lord" is suitably respectful . until we get to the disco break in the latter song and Larry again adopting Mick Jagger mode starts singing\, "I'm So Bored".  Call me iconoclastic but these songs deserve to be ripped apart!  After the Clapton rumors of conversion which surface every five years or so\, "Presence Of The Lord" is given a straight rendition although it's worth bearing in mind Larry reports that Clapton wrote it to express escaping from the police who wanted to bust him for drugs!  This CD release closes with two bonus tracks which did not appear on the original vinyl release.  This time they're introduced by Larry's Big Bomber DJ alter-ego on Radio K.R.A.P. and include another great Mick Jagger impersonation on "I Am Waiting".  Mischievous yet making an important contribution cataloguing counterfeit "Christian" culture.  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Larry's Site: http://www.larrynorman.com/ ----------------------------------------------------------------	1

If ever the devil's plan\, was made to torment man\, It was you\, Jezebel\, it was you.  'Twould be better I had I never known\, Ever had I never known\, A lover such as you. Forsaking dreams and all\, For the siren call of your arms.  Like a demon\, love possessed me\, You obsessed me constantly. What evil star is mine\, That my fate's design\, Should be Jezebel?  If ever a pair of eyes\, Promised paradise. Deceiving me\, grieving me\, Leavin' me blue. Jezebel\, it was you.  If ever the devil's plan\, was made to torment man\, It was you\, Night an' day\, every way. Oh\, Jezebel\, Jezebel\, Jezebel. Jezebel.	1

Their breakthrough hit was "Clap Your Hands"\, which hit #1 in Canada and Australia\,[1] and peaked at #45 on the US Billboard pop charts[2] and #40 on Cashbox.[3] The tune was also released in French as "Frappe Tes Mains". Their debut\, ten-track full-length came out in 1960; they appeared on American Bandstand and at a charity concert at Carnegie Hall soon afterward. Two more albums followed before the group broke up in 1963; a 1968 reunion saw "Clap Your Hands" get a re-release.	1

COL title VAL If I Should Lose You COL performer VAL Nina Simone	COL video title VAL BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band COL channel name VAL JohnMcEuenMusic COL description VAL Music and lyrics by Jimmy Driftwood:   Jimmy Driftwood was a high school principal and history teacher who loved to sing\, play instruments and write songs. Mr. Driftwood wrote many songs\, all for the sole purpose of helping his students learn about this battle and other historical events. But this song turned out to be so popular that it won the 1959 Grammy Award for Song Of The Year (awarded in 1960 for musical accomplishments in 1959). Johnny Horton also won the 1959 Grammy Award for Best Country And Western Performance for his recording of this song. "The Battle of New Orleans\," is about a battle in the War of 1812\, and it became one of the biggest selling hits of 1959.   After the Battle of New Orleans\, which Andrew Jackson won on January the 8th eighteen and fifteen\, the boys played the fiddle again that night\, only they changed the name of it from the battle of a place in Ireland to the Eighth of January. Years passed and in about nineteen and forty-five an Arkansas school teacher slowed the tune down and put words to it and that song is The Battle Of New Orleans and I will try to sing it for you.   Well\, in eighteen and fourteen we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississip. We took a little bacon and we took a little beans\, And we caught the bloody British near the town of New Orleans.  We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin. There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago. We fired once more and they began to runnin' down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.  Well\, I see'd Mars Jackson walkin down the street talkin' to a pirate by the name of Jean Lafitte [pronounced La-feet] He gave Jean a drink that he brung from Tennessee and the pirate said he'd help us drive the British in the sea.  The French said Andrew\, you'd better run\, for Packingham's a comin' with a bullet in his gun. Old Hickory said he didn't give a dang\, he's gonna whip the britches off of Colonel Packingham.  We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin. There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago. We fired once more and they began to runnin' down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.  Well\, we looked down the river and we see'd the British come\, and there must have been a hundred of 'em beatin' on the drum. They stepped so high and they made their bugles ring while we stood by our cotton bales and didn't say a thing.  Old Hickory said we could take 'em by surprise if we didn't fire a musket til we looked 'em in the eyes. We held our fire til we see'd their faces well\, then we opened up with squirrel guns and really gave a yell.  We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin. There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago. We fired once more and they began to runnin' down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.  Well\, we fired our cannon til the barrel melted down\, so we grabbed an alligator and we fought another round. We filled his head with cannon balls and powdered his behind\, and when they tetched the powder off\, the gator lost his mind.  We'll march back home but we'll never be content till we make Old Hickory the people's President. And every time we think about the bacon and the beans\, we'll think about the fun we had way down in New Orleans.  We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin\, But there wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago. We fired once more and they began to runnin' down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.  Well\, they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go. They ran so fast the hounds couldn't catch 'em down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.  We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin. But there wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago. We fired once more and they began to runnin' down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.	0

It takes a great singer to really do justice to Dylan\, yet KT goes well beyond that and makes this her own. She's just that good live.  I work nights in a television studio and used to come home in the morning to find absolutely nothing interesting to watch on television. The last thing I wanted to see was more commercials. And I'm not really interested in watching talk shows and soap operas.  Then I discovered the commercial free music channel RAVE. HD quality video and pretty much perfect 5.1 sound. A few times a week they run "Later With Jools Holland" in the morning. Jools has great taste in music and each show runs the gamut from pop\, rock\, folk\, Celtic\, African\, to Joanna Newsome. Something for everyone. Suffice to say I love this show.  Uploaded as a high quality 640 x 480 MPEG4 file using Pinnacle Studio.

It is an arrangement of (and an "answer song" to) Bo Diddley's "I'm a Man" (which in turn was inspired by Waters' and Willie Dixon's "Hoochie Coochie Man"). "Mannish Boy" features a repeating stop-time figure on one chord throughout the song and is credited to Waters\, Mel London\, and Bo Diddley.  Muddy Waters versions  The original version of "Mannish Boy" was recorded in Chicago on May 24\, 1955\, under the title "Manish Boy." Accompanying Muddy Waters on vocals and guitar were Jimmy Rogers on guitar\, Junior Wells on harmonica\, Fred Below on drums\, and an un-identified female chorus. The original version was the only recording done by Muddy Waters between January 1953 and June 1957 that did not feature Little Walter on harmonica and was one of few studio recordings with Junior Wells.  Muddy Waters recorded several versions of "Mannish Boy" during his career. In 1968\, he recorded it for the Electric Mud album in Marshall Chess' attempt to attract the rock market. After he left Chess\, he recorded it for the 1977 Hard Again album which was produced by Johnny Winter. The song also was included on the live album Muddy "Mississippi" Waters - Live (1979).  Charts and accolades  The song reached #5 during a stay of six weeks in the Billboard R&B chart. The song was Muddy Waters only chart appearance on the UK Singles Chart peaking at #51.  In 1986\, Muddy Waters' original "Mannish Boy" was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame "Classics of Blues Recordings" category. It was also included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's list of the "500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll". "Mannish Boy" is ranked #229 in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the "500 Greatest Songs of All Time".  Cover versions  A cover by Jimi Hendrix appears on the compilation album Blues.  Paul Butterfield covered the song in 1986 on his album The Legendary Paul Butterfield Rides Again.  It was covered by Hindu Love Gods in their album of the same name.  The song also appears on The Bocephus Box\, a three-CD box set by Hank Williams\, Jr.\, released in 2000.  Elliott Murphy covered it in 2005 on Murphy gets Muddy.  The Rolling Stones have often incorporated this song\, among other blues standards\, into their live set\, and it can be heard on the albums Love You Live and Rarities 1971-2003.  Wolfmother did a cover of the song for their special edition version of Cosmic Egg.  Black Stone Cherry performed a heavier version along with Hoochie Coochie Man in October 2009 at Rockaplast in Germany.  It was further rearranged in the 2003 Martin Scorsese documentary film series titled The Blues. In the fifth film\, titled Godfathers and Sons and directed by Marc Levin\, Mannish Boy was redone by The ElectriK Mud Kats (a.k.a. The Electric Mud Band\, Muddy Waters' backing group from his album Electric Mud) with vocals by hip hop artists Chuck D\, Common & Kyle Jason.  Roger Daltrey performed a cover of the song on Jools Holland's New Years show on December 31\, 2010.  A version of the song recorded by Erykah Badu was featured in an H&M TV advert in spring 2011.  Aerosmith performed the song on The Howard Stern Show on January 13\, 1995.	0

COL title VAL That's All COL performer VAL Jimmy Bruno	COL video title VAL That's All By Mel Torme COL channel name VAL texpaco COL description VAL Mel Tormé was an American musician and singer best known for his classic jazz vocals.  He was also a jazz composer and arranger\, a drummer\, an actor in radio\, film\, and television\, and the author of five books.  He co-wrote the classic holiday song "The Christmas Song" ("Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire") with Bob Wells.  In 1944 he formed the vocal quintet "Mel Tormé and His Mel-Tones"\, modeled on Frank Sinatra and The Pied Pipers.  His appearance in the 1947 film musical "Good News" made him a teen idol for several years.  His 1949 composition "California Suite" became Capitol Records' first 12-inch LP album.  His recording of "Careless Hands" was his only #1 hit\, although "Again" and "Blue Moon" became his signature tunes.  His singing at New York's Copacabana led a local disc jockey to give him the nickname "The Velvet Fog".  His last hit was the 1962 R&B song "Comin' Home\, Baby" which reached #36 on the pop chart.  In February 1999\, Tormé was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.  This selection is the title song from his album "That's All" released in 1965.	1

COL title VAL Moonlight in Vermont COL performer VAL André Previn	COL video title VAL Ella Fitzgerald ft Ralph Carmichael & Orchestra - It Came Upon A Midnight Clear (Capitol Rec 1967) COL channel name VAL ChristmasTimeTV COL description VAL "It Came Upon a Midnight Clear" (sometimes rendered as "It Came Upon a Midnight Clear") is a poem and Christmas carol written by Edmund Sears\, pastor of the Unitarian Church in Lancaster\, Massachusetts. Sears' lyrics are most commonly set to one of two melodies: "Carol\," composed by Richard Storrs Willis\, or "Noel\," adapted from an English melody.  Ella's accompanied by Ralph Carmichael & Orchestra.  (Capitol Records)  It came upon the midnight clear\,  That glorious song of old\,  From angels bending near the earth  To touch their harps of gold! Peace on the earth\, good will to men\,  From heaven's all gracious King!  The world in solemn stillness lay  To hear the angels sing.   Still through the cloven skies they come  With peaceful wings unfurled  And still their heavenly music floats  O'er all the weary world;  Above its sad and lowly plains  They bend on hovering wing.  And ever o'er its Babel sounds  The blessed angels sing.  Yet with te woes of sin and strife  The world hath suffered long;  Beneath the angel-strain have rolled  Two thousand years of wrong;  And man\, at war with man\, hears not  The love song which they bring:  O hush the noise\, ye men of strife\,  And hear the angels sing.   For lo! the days are hastening on\,  By prophet bards foretold\,  When\, with the ever-circling years\,  Shall come the Age of Gold;  When peace shall over all the earth  Its ancient splendors fling\,  And all the world give back the song  Which now the angels sing.	0

Known as "Rompin' Ronnie" Hawkins or "The Hawk\," he was a key player in the 1960s rock scene in Toronto and for the next 40 years\, performed all over North America\, recording more than twenty-five albums. His best-known hits are "Forty Days" and "Mary Lou" (about the song narrator's experiences with a golddigging woman)\, both were major hits for him in 1959.  At the age of nine\, his family moved to nearby Fayetteville. After graduating from high school\, he studied physical education at the University of Arkansas where he formed his first band\, The Hawks\, touring with them throughout Arkansas\, Oklahoma and Missouri. Hawkins also owned and operated the Rockwood Club in Fayetteville where some of Rock music's earliest pioneers came to play including Jerry Lee Lewis\, Carl Perkins\, Roy Orbison and Conway Twitty.  Ronnie Hawkins came to Canada in 1958. His first gig was at the Golden Rail in Hamilton\, Ontario where he became an overnight success. It was a result of Hawkins success in Hamilton that he decided to move to Canada permanently. His career spans over five decades and 25 records. His hits include\, "Forty Days"\, "Mary Lou"\, and "Hey Bo Diddley".   In 1958\, he moved to Canada with the Hawks and made Peterborough\, Ontario his permanent home. Gradually the members of the Hawks\, except for Levon Helm\, were replaced with talented Canadians Robbie Robertson\, Rick Danko\, Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson. This was the line-up that was to later become The Band.  In 1975 Bob Dylan cast him as 'Bob Dylan' in the movie Renaldo and Clara.  His 1984 LP\, 'Making It Again'\, garnered him a Juno Award as Canada's best Country Male Vocalist. Playing with The Band\, Hawkins helped tear down the Berlin Wall in 1989 and performed at President Bill Clinton's 1992 inaugural party. In addition to his music\, he has also become an accomplished actor\, hosting his own television show "Honky Tonk" in the early 1980s and appearing in such films as Heaven's Gate with his friend Kris Kristofferson and Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II.  October 4\, 2002 was declared "Ronnie Hawkins Day" by the city of Toronto when Hawkins was inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame in recognition of his lifetime contribution to music and his generous support of the Schizophrenia Society of Ontario and other charitable organizations. Ronnie Hawkins was inducted into the Canadian Music Industry Hall of Fame at the Canadian Music Industry Awards on March 4\, 2004. His pioneering contribution to the genre has also been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame.  In recent years\, Ronnie Hawkins had reportedly been battling pancreatic cancer. His allegedly miraculous recovery\, attributed to everything from psychic healers to native herbal medicine\, is featured in the film Ronnie Hawkins: Still Alive and Kicking.  In 2005\, he was awarded an honorary degree from Laurentian University.  Also Ronnie recently has reissued most of his albums on CD through Unidisc Music Inc.	0

In one of the most simple\, but very jazz interpretation of the song "Tea For Two" from her 1997 CD entitle"When the Wind Was Cool".  ESPAÑOL PARA LOS QUE NO ENTIENDEN: Una actuación muy especial por uno de mis bajistas europeo favoritos\, Ira Coleman y la voz única de una extraordinario cantante de Nueva Inglaterra de nombre Dominique Eade. En una de la interpretación más simple\, pero muy jazziada de la canción "Tea For Two"\, de su CD "cuando el viento era fresco"." When The Wind Was Cool".  MORE ABOUT DOMINIQUE EADE: http://www.dominiqueeade.com/biography.html  MORE ABOUT IRA COLEMAN: World Musician Ira Coleman was born in Stockholm\, Sweden. Raised in Southern France\, Ira thereafter lived in Germany for fourteen years. While in Germany\, Ira Coleman studied double bass at Cologne's "Hochschule für Musik" and subsequently came a move to the US to attend Berklee College of Music in Boston. "I have very strong ties to Europe\," says Ira who is fluent in French and German. "My mother was Swedish and a famous silversmith and designer\, and my father was a painter and graphic artist from Baltimore. The place to go was Paris. My parents met many expatriate artists\, writers and musicians." Among visitors to Ira's childhood home were Louis Armstrong\, Billie Holiday\, Ray Charles\, Charlie Mingus and Chester Himes. Ira got his inspiration at an early age\, though he didn't actually pick up a bass until he was 19 years old. "The bass fits my character\," says Ira\, who graduated from Berklee College of Music in 1985. "In most musical genres the bass is the pivotal center piece\, the instrument which provides a discrete and clear foundation\, and I enjoy the many challenges its function poses." Ira's resumé tells the story. Over the years\, Ira has worked with such well-known figures as Cab Calloway\, Freddie Hubbard\, Betty Carter\, Branford Marsalis\, Herbie Hancock\, Wayne Shorter\, Jessye Norman and Sting. He was musical director for vocalist Dee Dee Bridgewater and toured with her internationally from 2002 until 2009. One night he's on the stage at Carnegie Hall playing in a tribute to African-American culture. The next morning he is on a plane to Europe to collaborate on a recording or heading to Japan for a jazz festival. As comfortable playing Jamaican rhythms as he is accompanying a gospel choir or performing in a Jazz trio\, this professional bass player has built an international reputation for versatility.	0

COL title VAL Mama\, Talk to Your Daughter COL performer VAL John Mayall's Bluesbreakers	COL video title VAL Ladi Geisler - Java COL channel name VAL Socratess2007 COL description VAL It was a huge instrumental hit for trumpet player Al Hirt back in 1964\, this Allen Toussaint's "Java".  Toussaint wrote the tune in 1958 for an album that would be released by RCA and Toussaint's studio recording did quite well in the easy listening charts.  But Al Hirt's trumpet version did even better : it was on the no1 position (easy listening) for several weeks.  Hirt also won a Grammy Award in the category "Best instrumentalist or orchestra".  Here Bert Kaempfert's "knack bass specialist" Ladi Geisler brings us his guitar version and\, even if  the arrangement stays quite close to the original one\, the mere fact of using a guitar to play the lead theme works remarkably refreshing. From his 2002 album "Those were the days" here is Ladi Geisler with "Java".  Enjoy !	0

Quand il me prend dans ses bras\, Qu'il me parle tout bas\, Je vois la vie en rose; Il me dit des mots d'amour\, Des mots de tous les jours\, Et ça m' fait quelque chose. Il est entré dans mon coeur\, Une part de bonheur Dont je connais la cause\, C'est lui pour moi\, moi pour lui dans la vie; Il me l'a dit\, l'a juré pour la vie; Et dès que je l'aperçois\, Alors je sens en moi Mon coeur qui bat.  Des nuits d'amour à plus finir\, Un grand bonheur qui prend sa place\, Les ennuis\, les chagrins trépassent... Heureux\, heureux à en mourir!	0

COL title VAL Call Me COL performer VAL Brenda Lee	COL video title VAL The Kingston Trio - MTA COL channel name VAL John1948SevenE COL description VAL The Kingston Trio's place in the sun was etched in stone virtually from the get-go. The band formed in 1957 and by the following year had a very successful single called "Tom Dooley" resting atop the pop charts. The trio\, though certainly more commercially viable than some of the more authentic folkies of the late '50s\, had a lot to do with the success of the folk revival in that era; folk music rang out from college campuses everywhere in the late '50s and '60s as the genre's left-leaning stylists were part of the evolving changing social atmosphere in America. Whether or not they knew their music was paving the way for artists more deeply involved in these changes (Bob Dylan\, Joan Baez)\, it did sell plenty of records. And the folk revival of this era mirrored the Depression-era folk music of Woody Guthrie\, Leadbelly\, Josh White and others. The '60s genre took on the Vietnam War to rail against. The Kingston Trio began in San Francisco with Bob Shane (b. 1934)\, Nick Reynolds (b. 1933) and Dave Guard (1934-1991) joining forces. Their first album\, THE KINGSTON TRIO\, included "Tom Dooley" and it was played so much by DJs that Capitol released it as a single that eventually sold nearly 3 million records. The song as written by Guard was taken from a 19th century mountain ballad about Tom Dula\, who was hanged for murdering his sweetheart. Several albums ensued for the trio\, all doing well commercially but\, while it had 10 singles charted by 1963\, only "Reverend Mr. Black" got into the Top 10. However\, the Kingston Trio is remembered for other tuneslike "M.T.A.\," "The Tijuana Jail\," "A Worried Man" and "Greenback Dollar." Meanwhile\, Guard opted for a solo career in 1961\, his replacement being John Stewart (b. 1939)\, who stayed until 1967\, when he embarked on a solo career that in 1979 put three singles in the charts with his "Gold" reaching No. 5. As the more intensive folk-rock grew\, making folkies like the Kingston Trio old-fashioned\, the trio\, now Roger Gamble\, George Grove and Shane\, broke up in 1968. A TV reunion in 1981 had all six members together for the first time. In 1987\, the Trio was put back together with Shane\, Grove and Bob Haworth recreating it all for nostalgia audiences.

COL title VAL Hallelujah COL performer VAL Natalia & Gabriel Rios	COL video title VAL Edda Magnasson - Trubbel COL channel name VAL Emilia Arroyo COL description VAL Nu lyser ängarna av sommarns alla blommor. Nu surrar bin\, och fåglar sjunger överallt. Nu stryker vinden genom trädens höga kronor men i min trädgård är det visset\, mörkt och kallt. Här är det risigt och förvuxet\, fult och snårigt och lika hopplöst grått och trist som i mitt bröst. Därute doftar det av sommarns alla dofter. Där är det sommar\, men här inne är det höst.  Jag levde lycklig här med dig och mina katter ett liv i synd och utan omsorg att bli frälst. Försonad med min karaktär\, för jag har aldrig förmott att säga nej till någonting som helst. Och aldrig nekat mig det ena eller andra\, och levat livet\, tills jag krossades en dag. Det börja med att du bedrog mig med en annan\, en som du sa var mycket finare än jag.  Vårt gräl tog veckor\, ropen blandades med gråten och jag blev grundligt jämförd med din fina vän Tills du bekände att hon givit dig på båten Då blev det dödstyst här i trädgården igen! Ifrån den stunden var den kvinnan dubbelt hatad Hon hade lekt med dig\, med oss ett litet slag Och ja jag kände det som även jag var ratad Jag ville slåss\, och gick mot mitt livs nederlag  Jag kom med hammaren beredd under min kappa När hon kom ut i sidenpumps och sa: God dag! Kom in och slå dig ner en stund så får vi prata! Jag bara stammade\, nu minns jag inte vad... Och jag blev bjuden på likör och cigarriller och kunde inte få mig till att säga nej! Och när vi skiljdes var vi bästisar och bundis och jag tog saker som du glömt med hem till dig!  Jag går omkring i mitt pompej\, i bland ruiner och jag traskar runt i resterna utav vårt liv Men du skall aldrig ge mig pikar om sekiner och aldrig skall du bli en annans tidsfördriv! Nej\, åt det gamla skall vi binda vackra kransar och ta vårt liv och mina katter som de är. Och trots all kärleksbrist och trasighet och fransar Dig skall jag älska livet ut\, dig har jag kär!	0

As a second line of attack he decamped to his home with a pile of recording equipment and a few friends to record a series of tongue in cheek cover version.  Randy Stonehill introduces the songs in the style of an OTT egotistical West Coast DJ\, The Surf Duke\, and frankly this has some hysterically funny moments!  Their acoustic version of Norman Greenbaum's "Spirit In The Sky" is absolutely hilarious!  Larry's imitation of Mick Jagger on the Stones' "Shine A Light" is outrageous and the segue of "Bridge Over Troubled Water"\, "Let It Be" and "My Sweet Lord" is suitably respectful . until we get to the disco break in the latter song and Larry again adopting Mick Jagger mode starts singing\, "I'm So Bored".  Call me iconoclastic but these songs deserve to be ripped apart!  After the Clapton rumors of conversion which surface every five years or so\, "Presence Of The Lord" is given a straight rendition although it's worth bearing in mind Larry reports that Clapton wrote it to express escaping from the police who wanted to bust him for drugs!  This CD release closes with two bonus tracks which did not appear on the original vinyl release.  This time they're introduced by Larry's Big Bomber DJ alter-ego on Radio K.R.A.P. and include another great Mick Jagger impersonation on "I Am Waiting".  Mischievous yet making an important contribution cataloguing counterfeit "Christian" culture.  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Larry's Site: http://www.larrynorman.com/ ----------------------------------------------------------------	0

COL title VAL Java Boy COL performer VAL Peggy Peters	COL video title VAL Ladi Geisler - Java COL channel name VAL Socratess2007 COL description VAL It was a huge instrumental hit for trumpet player Al Hirt back in 1964\, this Allen Toussaint's "Java".  Toussaint wrote the tune in 1958 for an album that would be released by RCA and Toussaint's studio recording did quite well in the easy listening charts.  But Al Hirt's trumpet version did even better : it was on the no1 position (easy listening) for several weeks.  Hirt also won a Grammy Award in the category "Best instrumentalist or orchestra".  Here Bert Kaempfert's "knack bass specialist" Ladi Geisler brings us his guitar version and\, even if  the arrangement stays quite close to the original one\, the mere fact of using a guitar to play the lead theme works remarkably refreshing. From his 2002 album "Those were the days" here is Ladi Geisler with "Java".  Enjoy !	1

Lainie Kazan (born Lainie Levine in 1940 in New York City) is an American actress and singer. Born to an Ashkenazic Jewish father and a Sephardic Jewish mother\, Kazan began her Broadway career as understudy to Barbra Streisand in "Funny Girl"\, finally getting to go on eighteen months into the run when the star was felled by a serious throat problem. Coincidentally\, both had attended the same high school\, Erasmus High School in Brooklyn\, New York. Kazan's mother alerted the press and\, encouraged by rave reviews for her performance\, she quit the show and set out to establish herself in a singing career. She appeared in numerous supper clubs across the country\, and guested on Dean Martin's variety series twenty-six times. Other television work includes recurring roles on the sitcom "The Nanny" and on "Veronica's Closet"\, and guest shots on "St. Elsewhere" (resulting in an Emmy nomination)\, "The Paper Chase"\, "Touched by an Angel" (with Della Reese)\, and "Will & Grace".  Kazan returned to Broadway to recreate her film role for the musical adaptation of "My Favorite Year"\, earning a Tony Award nomination for her performance. She has also appeared in regional productions of "A Little Night Music"\, "Man of La Mancha"\, "Gypsy"\, "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"\, "Hello Dolly!"\, and "Fiddler on the Roof"\, among others. Kazan's feature films include Francis Ford Coppola's "One from the Heart"\, "My Favorite Year" (both in 1982)\, "Lust in the Dust" (1985)\, "Harry and the Hendersons" (1987)\, "Beaches" (1988)\, "The Cemetery Club" (1993)\, "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" (2002)\, "Gigli" (2003)\, "Red Riding Hood" (2004)\, "Whiskey School" (2005). In recent years\, Kazan has kept busy performing on concert stages and in Las Vegas and Atlantic City showrooms. Kazan posed for a spread in Playboy magazine that appeared in the October\, 1970\, issue\, an interesting departure from the magazine's usual norm of ultra-slender women. Kazan's Playboy spread inspired Jack Kirby to create the DC Comics superheroine Big Barda. Listen to Lainie's big and sunny voice and enjoy!	0

Erma’s career for Shout! Records resulted in several single releases in 1967 including Big Boss Man  This recording was made when Erma took the stage at the Carousel Ballroom in San Francisco for three nights in April from the 19th to the 21st in 1968. Backing her was Mike Bloomfield’s Electric Flag\, a blues rock group. Much of the research done in identifying the date\, venue and personnel was by Dave M of the westcoastacidandpsychedelia Yahoo group. Says Dave: “The week before at the Carousel (April 14\, 1968)\, there had been an unscheduled Sunday show and jam session featuring Quicksilver Messenger Service and numerous other musicians. The tape circulates\, and since Gary Duncan jokes about Easter Sunday\, it makes it easy to reliably date the show. All this points to another Sunday jam session\, so if I had to guess I would pick Sunday\, April 21 for the date of this show. Anyway\, that’s my story and I’m sticking to it.”	0

Faith" (New Order cover version) and "Alone Again Or" (Love cover version) were originally recorded for a Peel session on the 7th April 1991.  ------------------------  "Alone Again Or" is a song originally recorded in 1967 by rock group Love. It was written by band member Bryan MacLean. It was the opening track on the album Forever Changes\, and was also released as a single in the USA\, UK\, Australia\, France and Holland.  Versions have subsequently been recorded by an eclectic variety of bands and singers including The Damned (1986)\, The Oblivians (1993)\, UFO (1977)\, Sarah Brightman (1990)\, The Boo Radleys (1991)\, Chris Pérez Band (1999)\, Calexico (2004)\, Matthew Sweet and Susanna Hoffs (2006)\, Les Fradkin (2007). Two demo versions by MacLean himself were released in 1997 on his album Ifyoubelievein.  Original recording by Love  Bryan MacLean originally wrote the song\, then called simply "Alone Again"\, in 1965 for Love's debut album. However\, he did not complete it until the recording of Forever Changes in summer 1967. The song was inspired by his memory of waiting for a girlfriend\, and the melody drew on Prokofiev's Lieutenant Kije Suite. The essence of the song is the contrast between the positivity of the tune and the bleakness of the lyrics\, with the chorus "And I will be alone again tonight\, my dear."  For the recording session\, arranger David Angel worked with MacLean\, and they added a string section and a horn part for a mariachi band whom co-producer Bruce Botnick had recently used on a Tijuana Brass album. MacLean later said "That was the happiest I ever was with anything we ever did as a band - the orchestral arrangement of that song." However\, Botnick\, with co-producer and band leader Arthur Lee\, remixed the track to bring Lee's own unison vocal to the forefront of the song\, at least partly on the grounds that MacLean's own vocal lead was too weak. Lee also added to the mystery of the song by changing the title to "Alone Again Or".  Released as a single at the beginning of 1968\, "Alone Again Or" reached #99 on the US Billboard pop charts. Over the years it has become regarded as a classic of the era\, being ranked #436 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.  The song has been featured in several motion pictures\, most notably two in 1996: Bottle Rocket and Sleepers. It also appeared at the close of the 2009 British comedy movie Bunny and the Bull\, playing as the lead character finally breaks free of his obsessions.  Single by The Damned  "Alone Again Or" was a single released by The Damned in 1987. They recorded it as an acknowledgement of one of their influences\, Love. Boosted by multi-format releases (including the band's first CD single\, which included the first release of their version of "Eloise" on this format) and a surreal video helmed by Gerard de Thame\, the single peaked at #27 - The Damned's final Top 40 hit to date. The UK B-side "In Dulce Decorum" was recorded live at the Hammersmith Odeon on November 12\, 1986.  MCA also issued the single in the USA\, their first single to be issued in the territory since "Dr Jekyll & Mr Hyde" in 1981. This release added the studio version of "In Dulce Decorum" in place of the live version on the UK release.	0

COL title VAL De nære ting COL performer VAL Anny Fyhn	COL video title VAL Ladi Geisler - Java COL channel name VAL Socratess2007 COL description VAL It was a huge instrumental hit for trumpet player Al Hirt back in 1964\, this Allen Toussaint's "Java".  Toussaint wrote the tune in 1958 for an album that would be released by RCA and Toussaint's studio recording did quite well in the easy listening charts.  But Al Hirt's trumpet version did even better : it was on the no1 position (easy listening) for several weeks.  Hirt also won a Grammy Award in the category "Best instrumentalist or orchestra".  Here Bert Kaempfert's "knack bass specialist" Ladi Geisler brings us his guitar version and\, even if  the arrangement stays quite close to the original one\, the mere fact of using a guitar to play the lead theme works remarkably refreshing. From his 2002 album "Those were the days" here is Ladi Geisler with "Java".  Enjoy !	0

COL title VAL Summertime COL performer VAL Charles Mingus with Hampton Hawes & Danny Richmond	COL video title VAL Burl Ives ft Owen Bradley & Orchestra - A Holly Jolly Christmas (MCA Records 1965) COL channel name VAL ChristmasTimeTV COL description VAL "A Holly Jolly Christmas" is a popular song written by Johnny Marks.  Although he was Jewish\, he specialized in Christmas songs and wrote many standards including "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\," "I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day\," "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\, and "Run Rudolph Run."  This song was first recorded by the Quinto Sisters and later by Burl Ives.  The guitarist is Harold Ray Bradley\, the brother of the musical director Owen Bradley.  Burl Icle Ivanhoe Ives (June 14\, 1909 – April 14\, 1995) was an American singer and actor of stage\, screen\, radio and television.  He began as an itinerant singer and banjoist\, and launched his own radio show\, The Wayfaring Stranger\, which popularized traditional folk songs. In 1942 he appeared in Irving Berlin's This Is the Army\, and then became a major star of CBS radio. In the 1960s he successfully crossed over into country music\, recording hits such as "A Little Bitty Tear" and "Funny Way of Laughing". A popular film actor through the late 1940s and 1950s\, Ives's best-known roles in that medium included parts in So Dear to My Heart and Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\, as well as Rufus Hannassey in The Big Country\, for which he won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.  Ives is often remembered for his starring role in the 1964 Christmas stop-motion television special Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\, which continues to air on CBS every Christmas season\, as the voice of "Sam the Snowman"\, the special's host and narrator.  Have a holly\, jolly Christmas;  It's the best time of the year  I don't know if there'll be snow  but have a cup of cheer  Have a holly\, jolly Christmas;  And when you walk down the street  Say Hello to friends you know  and everyone you meet   Oh ho  the mistletoe  hung where you can see;  Somebody waits for you;  Kiss her once for me  Have a holly jolly Christmas  and in case you didn't hear  Oh by golly  have a holly  jolly Christmas this year	0

Why should our magical moments of madness Be leaving me with such a feeling of sadness? I know I am playing a forbidden game For the girl that I love is not sharing my name.  There isn't anything special about her But try as I may\, life means nothing without her Perhaps I'm a fool to be hoping in vain But I know that I'm playing a forbidden game.  No one can tell me how long love will last If the future will bring me much more than the past Should I show her I worry? I don't think I dare When my happiness lies in each moment we share.  I'll go on loving her\, just as before For she's all that I want\, and I ask nothing more And if things should go wrong\, I must take all the blame For you're bound to get hurt playing forbidden games.	0

The music was written by Vincent Rose\, the lyrics by [John L. Rooney]. It was recorded six times in 1940. Victor Records released the recording by the Sammy Kaye Orchestra with vocals by Tommy Ryan on May 31\, 1940 (catalog #26643\, with the flip side "Maybe"; matrix #51050). Gene Krupa's version was issued on the Okeh label (#5672) on June 3. Other 1940 recordings were by: Glenn Miller on Bluebird (10768)\, Kay Kyser\, Russ Morgan\, Gene Autry (also in the 1941 film The Singing Hill)\, Connee Boswell\, and Jimmy Dorsey. The largest 1940 hit was by Glenn Miller.  Louis Armstrong's 1949 recording charted in the Billboard Top 40. It was an international hit in 1956 for Fats Domino\, and has become a rock and roll standard. It reached number two\, for three weeks on the Billboard Top 40 charts\, becoming his biggest pop hit\, and spent eight non-consecutive weeks at number one on the R&B Best Sellers chart. The version by Fats Domino was also ranked #81 in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. The song was Domino's greatest hit and remains the song most associated with him.

(the first line of Domino's 1950s version of "Blueberry Hill") in reference to pretty girls he dated or wanted to date.  It is one of the songs that the time traveling James Cole enjoys in the film\, Twelve Monkeys\, and the song is later sung by the scientists upon his return to the future.  The song is purportedly named after a "make-out" spot in Taos\, New Mexico.  Joe Edwards' restaurant on the Delmar Loop in St. Louis\, Missouri\, where Chuck Berry frequently plays\, is named after the song.  The Far Side\, a comic written by Gary Larson\, features a comic parodying the lyrics of this song. A man is talking in a phone booth on top of a hill named "Blueberry Hill." He says into the phone "Norm? This is Mitch. ... You were right--I found my drill." The parody is of the line "found my thrill on Blueberry Hill."  Prime Minister of Russia Vladimir Putin made a cover performance of the song on December 10\, 2010 before an audience of international film and television celebrities\, in support of a charity for ill children. Videos of his performance quickly went viral worldwide.	0

Seals and Croft released the original in 1970\, the single reaching a respectable number 6 in the charts.

COL title VAL You Stepped out of a Dream COL performer VAL Doris Day	COL video title VAL Perez Prado - Guaglione (1958) COL channel name VAL Moraito COL description VAL Perez Prado (1958) Guaglione is a Neapolitan song with music by Giuseppe Fanciulli and words by Nicola "Nisa" Salerno. It was the winning song at the IV Napoli Song Festival broadcast by radio in 1956. The song's title means simply "boy" in Neapolitan language but as slang translates to "street bum"\, "urchin"\, "back street boy"\, "corner boy" or "street tough". The word guaglione has appeared as "wallyo" in New York immigrant slang. The song has been covered by various artists\, including Italian bandleader Renzo Arbore\, and Italian singers Claudio Villa\, Aurelio Fierro and Renato Carosone. Under the title "The Man Who Plays the Mandolino"\, with a lyric in English\, Dean Martin sang it in 1956 after Fred Raphael of Walt Disney Music Company obtained for Disney the U.S. publishing rights. The best known version of "Guaglione" was recorded by the Cuban bandleader Perez Prado in 1958 as an uptempo mambo tune. As a mambo\, the track rose to fame in 1995 after it was used for the Guinness advert "Anticipation". It has since been featured as the intro music for the 1996 video game Kingdom O' Magic\, and more recently as the opening music for the television showJimmy's Farm. The song is one of Disney's biggest profit makers. Written by G. Fanciulli &\, Nisa and produced by Herman Diaz\, Jr. All music or related performances remain the sole property of their respective copyright holders.

COL title VAL Roll with It COL performer VAL Steve Winwood	COL video title VAL BILLY VAUGHN CD Vintage Dance Orchestra. Volare \, Never On Sunday\, Old Cape Cod COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Richard "Billy Vaughn" (el 12 de abril de 1919 - el 26 de septiembre de 1991) era un cantante\, multiinstrumentista\, y líder de orquesta. Él nació en Glasgow\, Kentucky\, donde su padre era un barbero que amó la música e inspiró a Billy y le enseñó  tocar la mandolina a la edad de 3 años cuando padecía  un caso de la sarampión. Él continuó aprendiendo varios otros instrumentos.  En 1941 Vaughn se afilió a la Guardia Nacional de los Estados Unidos para lo que había sido preparado como una cesión de un año\, pero cuando la Segunda Guerra Mundial estalló\, le enviaron al extranjero hasta el final la guerra  en 1945.  Él decidió hacer de la música su carrera cuando él fue licenciado del ejército al final de guerra\, y asistió al Colegio de Estado de Kentucky Occidental\, ahora conocido como la Universidad de Kentucky Occidental.  Mientras él estaba un estudiante allí\, otros tres compañeros\, Jimmy Sacca\, Donald McGuire\, y Seymour Spiegelman\, que habían formado un trío vocal\, el Hilltoppers\, reclutaron a Vaughn para tocar el piano con ellos. Él pronto añadió su voz \, convirtiendo el trío en un cuarteto. Como  miembro del grupo\, él también escribió su primera canción \, Tentativa\, que charted en 1952.  En 1954 dejó el grupo para afiliarse a Archivos de Punto en Gallatin\, Tennessee como el director de música. Posteriormente formó su propia orquesta\, y tuvo un gran éxito en aquel mismo año "con la Melodía del Amor." Continuó cosechando éxitos  durante la próxima década y media. Vaughn murió del cáncer en Palomar\, California el 26 de septiembre\, { El 26 de septiembre} 1991.

Naturally\, they were required to run through as many takes of each song as was necessary to satisfy the exacting demands of their mentors. Luckily for us\, many of these alternate takes have survived. Mono was the standard recording format until the late 1960s\, but many of the big selling artists also recorded alternate versions specifically for the stereo market\, which was targeted to the discerning adult listener.     Disc One features all the alternate stereo versions of Coasters songs that were issued at the time on album and subsequently on CD. Disc Two takes you deep into the heart of Coasters sessions with composite tracks which combine studio chatter together with the finest moments from various different takes. This disc contains several outtakes which have until now been unavailable anywhere and gives an invaluable insight into the genesis of many well-loved tracks and also into the character and working practice of the Coasters and of their producers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller.     The accompanying 24-page booklet includes many rare photos and an exhaustive session discography by Claus Röhnisch. A collection for Coasters and early rock 'n' roll aficionados!	0

COL title VAL The Three Bells COL performer VAL Roy Orbison	COL video title VAL Lainie Kazan Tribute COL channel name VAL johnxxx20000 COL description VAL Here is a great song by a great lady of show business. Lainie Kazan (born Lainie Levine in 1940 in New York City) is an American actress and singer. Born to an Ashkenazic Jewish father and a Sephardic Jewish mother\, Kazan began her Broadway career as understudy to Barbra Streisand in "Funny Girl"\, finally getting to go on eighteen months into the run when the star was felled by a serious throat problem. Coincidentally\, both had attended the same high school\, Erasmus High School in Brooklyn\, New York. Kazan's mother alerted the press and\, encouraged by rave reviews for her performance\, she quit the show and set out to establish herself in a singing career. She appeared in numerous supper clubs across the country\, and guested on Dean Martin's variety series twenty-six times. Other television work includes recurring roles on the sitcom "The Nanny" and on "Veronica's Closet"\, and guest shots on "St. Elsewhere" (resulting in an Emmy nomination)\, "The Paper Chase"\, "Touched by an Angel" (with Della Reese)\, and "Will & Grace".  Kazan returned to Broadway to recreate her film role for the musical adaptation of "My Favorite Year"\, earning a Tony Award nomination for her performance. She has also appeared in regional productions of "A Little Night Music"\, "Man of La Mancha"\, "Gypsy"\, "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"\, "Hello Dolly!"\, and "Fiddler on the Roof"\, among others. Kazan's feature films include Francis Ford Coppola's "One from the Heart"\, "My Favorite Year" (both in 1982)\, "Lust in the Dust" (1985)\, "Harry and the Hendersons" (1987)\, "Beaches" (1988)\, "The Cemetery Club" (1993)\, "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" (2002)\, "Gigli" (2003)\, "Red Riding Hood" (2004)\, "Whiskey School" (2005). In recent years\, Kazan has kept busy performing on concert stages and in Las Vegas and Atlantic City showrooms. Kazan posed for a spread in Playboy magazine that appeared in the October\, 1970\, issue\, an interesting departure from the magazine's usual norm of ultra-slender women. Kazan's Playboy spread inspired Jack Kirby to create the DC Comics superheroine Big Barda. Listen to Lainie's big and sunny voice and enjoy!	0

The album seems to have fallen off a cliff but critically is among Legrand's finest achievements with 1970s electronics putting in an appearance on some tracks. David Rose recorded a memorable if somewhat 1950s time warped Stormy Weather but aided by Stamm's deliciously poised trumpet Legrand's gives the song a contemporary  slant.	0

I first thought that it must be because of some contractual conflict but when I discovered that wasn't the case\, I became downright stunned. By just about anyone's account\, Ms. Wilson's Blue Skies album is considered a masterpiece. Every tune from it is well played by the musicians and what Cass does with the lyrics to songs that have been sung by virtually all of the great jazz singers is something of a revelation. She manages to make all of the tunes seem brand new and never before heard. I think one of the best examples of that is this masterful handling of Rodgers and Hart's "I Didn't Know What Time It Was". While Terri Lyne Carrington keeps a steady fire beneath her\, Cass swings the tune\, beginning and ending some sung phrases with delightful little scats. She then breaks into a fully improvised scat right before Mulgrew Miller scorches us with his highly inventive solo. Special mention should also be made of rock-steady Lonnie Plaxico's bass work throughout\, always vibrant and swinging. I could have chosen any tune from the album to provide as an example of the album's fineness so don't settle on hearing just this tune. If you love jazz\, you've got to cop Cassandra Wilson's "Blue Skies".   Lineup:  Cassandra Wilson - vocals Mulgrew Miller - piano Lonnie Plaxico - bass Terri Lyne Carrington - drums	0

COL title VAL Sound of Silence COL performer VAL Regine [1]	COL video title VAL Ferrante & Teicher - The Sound of Silence (10/12) COL channel name VAL MultiUriahheep COL description VAL Ferrante & Teicher were a duo of American piano players\, known for their light arrangements of familiar classical pieces\, movie soundtracks\, and show tunes.  The Sound of Silence Paul Simon (BMI)  United Artists 6725 (1969)  Arthur Ferrante (September 7\, 1921\, New York City -- September 19\, 2009)\, and Louis Teicher (August 24\, 1924\, Wilkes-Barre\, Pennsylvania -- August 3\, 2008) met while studying at the Juilliard School of Music in New York. Musical prodigies\, they began performing as a piano duo while still in school. After graduating\, they both joined the Juilliard faculty.  Steven Tyler of Aerosmith relates the story that in the 1950's the two students practiced in the home of his grandmother Constance Neidhart Tallarico.  In 1947\, they launched a full-time concert career\, at first playing nightclubs\, then quickly moving up to playing classical music with orchestral backing. Between 1950 and 1980\, they were a major American easy listening act\, and scored four big U.S. hits: "Theme From The Apartment" (Pop #10)\, "Theme From Exodus" (Pop #2)\, "Tonight" (Pop #8)\, and "Midnight Cowboy" (Pop #10). They performed and recorded regularly with pops orchestras popular standards by George Gershwin\, Jerome Kern\, Cole Porter\, Richard Rodgers and others. In 1973\, they did the Hollywood Radio Theater theme for the Rod Serling radio drama series\, The Zero Hour.  The duo also experimented with prepared pianos\, adding paper\, sticks\, rubber\, wood blocks\, metal bars\, chains\, glass\, mallets\, and other found objects to piano string beds. In this way they were able to produce a variety of bizarre sounds that sometimes resembled percussion instruments\, and at other times resulted in special effects that sounded as if they were electronically synthesized.  Both men were initiated as honorary members of Tau Kappa Epsilon at Central State University (now University of Central Oklahoma) while on tour.  Ferrante and Teicher ceased performing in 1989 and retired to Longboat Key and Siesta Key\, respectively\, both close to each other on the west coast of Florida. They continued to play together occasionally at a local piano store.  CDs of their music\, some of it not previously released\, have continued to appear.  Louis Teicher died in 2008\, three weeks before his 84th birthday. Arthur Ferrante died on September 19\, 2009 at 88 (he had once said he wanted to live one year for each piano key). Arthur is survived by his wife\, Jena; his daughter\, Brenda Eberhardt; and two granddaughters.	1

The band formed in 1957 and by the following year had a very successful single called "Tom Dooley" resting atop the pop charts. The trio\, though certainly more commercially viable than some of the more authentic folkies of the late '50s\, had a lot to do with the success of the folk revival in that era; folk music rang out from college campuses everywhere in the late '50s and '60s as the genre's left-leaning stylists were part of the evolving changing social atmosphere in America. Whether or not they knew their music was paving the way for artists more deeply involved in these changes (Bob Dylan\, Joan Baez)\, it did sell plenty of records. And the folk revival of this era mirrored the Depression-era folk music of Woody Guthrie\, Leadbelly\, Josh White and others. The '60s genre took on the Vietnam War to rail against. The Kingston Trio began in San Francisco with Bob Shane (b. 1934)\, Nick Reynolds (b. 1933) and Dave Guard (1934-1991) joining forces. Their first album\, THE KINGSTON TRIO\, included "Tom Dooley" and it was played so much by DJs that Capitol released it as a single that eventually sold nearly 3 million records. The song as written by Guard was taken from a 19th century mountain ballad about Tom Dula\, who was hanged for murdering his sweetheart. Several albums ensued for the trio\, all doing well commercially but\, while it had 10 singles charted by 1963\, only "Reverend Mr. Black" got into the Top 10. However\, the Kingston Trio is remembered for other tuneslike "M.T.A.\," "The Tijuana Jail\," "A Worried Man" and "Greenback Dollar." Meanwhile\, Guard opted for a solo career in 1961\, his replacement being John Stewart (b. 1939)\, who stayed until 1967\, when he embarked on a solo career that in 1979 put three singles in the charts with his "Gold" reaching No. 5. As the more intensive folk-rock grew\, making folkies like the Kingston Trio old-fashioned\, the trio\, now Roger Gamble\, George Grove and Shane\, broke up in 1968. A TV reunion in 1981 had all six members together for the first time. In 1987\, the Trio was put back together with Shane\, Grove and Bob Haworth recreating it all for nostalgia audiences.

COL title VAL Moon River COL performer VAL Vassilikos	COL video title VAL Eddi Reader MOON RIVER COL channel name VAL daveinprogress3 COL description VAL It is always such a joy to listen to the tones of Scottish icon Eddi Reader. The singer has such exquisite sensibilities and respectfully memorialises standards such as this one\, as well as her original compositions and collaborations. The mark of a great singer is the ability to cover a song like 'Moon River'\, one of the most recorded tunes in history\, and still make it her own. Now more than half a century old\, the Henry Mancini classic penned for the Audrey Hepburn movie 'Breakfast at Tiffanys'\, is in truly safe hands with Ms Reader. It is delivered with such intimacy but at the same time\, potency and soul.	1

COL title VAL Lili Marleen COL performer VAL Milva	COL video title VAL Bettye LaVette - The Word (Amazing Beatles Cover) COL channel name VAL Steve Cabral COL description VAL Bettye turned the Beatles "The Word" into a stomping funk workout that bears only a tangential relationship to the original recording on Rubber Soul. She opens the song with the verse instead of the chorus. When she gets to the chorus\, she deploys two simultaneous parts\, rhythmically chanting "say it" while the background singers declaim a facsimile of what the Beatles originally sang. After a minute and a half\, she dispenses with what the Beatles had written\, spending the final two minutes funkifying her way through a kaleidoscope of sections involving James Brown like rhythmic declamations of vocals\, various permutations of the chorus\, a complete and sudden break and instrumental vamps. The result is a stunning revisioning of a song that most of us have had burned into our brains for almost 50 years!	0

COL title VAL Good Rocking Tonight COL performer VAL Jimmy Witherspoon with Brother Jack McDuff	COL video title VAL Eydie Gorme   Round Midnight COL channel name VAL ifcopod COL description VAL Don't tell anyone  I'd probably prefer this Gorme  performance to any by Billie Holiday.though I have a sneaking affection for the soupy strings added by Our Man on Broadway  Ray Ellis to   Billie's two late albums. Billie was vaunted for her assimilation of  jazz instrumentalists in effect using her voice  plus vibrato  like a jazz soloist. Edyie Gorme and  husband Steve Lawrence  had stellar careers as popular song stylists backed by Don Costa  Orchestra when she recorded   in the 1950s for ABC Paramount. Their careers crossed  as well as threading  solo   paths..OK point taken Gorme is not a tragedienne as Holiday was  but then some are not overly flexed about tragedy in music. However the punch line in this   special  performance   comes  at the close of a wonderful vibrato laden styling. Edyie  underlining that singers of   this calibre just aint around  She  really  caps the proceedings with an amazingly held  smoky   closing note seems wonderfully to go on   and on  and on ~ sadly  interrupted by the  head honchos    monitoring  the recording  What a gang of philistines.. .One of the best  endings  you'll hear  from any singer  Gorme's interpretation worth it for this  alone.	0

A few years later\, Evans explored ten of Hendrix's compositions with his unique 19-piece unit\, an orchestra that included two French horns\, the tuba of Howard Johnson\, three guitars\, two basses\, two percussionists and such soloists as altoist David Sanborn\, trumpeter Marvin "Hannibal" Peterson\, Billy Harper on tenor\, and guitarists Ryo Kawasaki and John Abercrombie.

COL title VAL While My Guitar Gently Weeps COL performer VAL Laurence Juber	COL video title VAL George E. Lee's Novelty Singing Orch. - St James Infirmary COL channel name VAL 240252 COL description VAL From Wikipedia:  St James Infirmary -- American folksong\, made famous by Louis Armstrong recording from 1928. (Many records credit it to Joe Primrose\, which is a pseudonim of Irving Mills - agent and songwriter\, probably an autor of an original arrangement).  George E. Lee Singing Novelty Orchestra steadily grew in number and sophistication throughout all the 1920s. George and his sister Julia's showmanship and strong vocals made the band a hit with the audiences in the 18th and Vine area. In August\, 1923\, the six-piece Lee band recorded for the OKeh label\, becoming the first African American band from Kansas City to record. Unfortunately\, Okeh judged the result of the session unsatisfactory and declined to release the two selections\, "Just Wait Until I'm gone" and "Waco Blues." Having missed an opportunity for national exposure\, the Lee band continued playing the dance halls and cabarets in the 18th and Vine community.  In November\, 1929\, the Lee band recorded six selections for the Brunswick label\, including "St James Infirmary." Louis Armstrong had recorded an up-tempo version of "Saint James Infirmary" a year earlier\, but it failed to catch on with the record-buying public. Lee's slower-tempo version better matched the solemn lyrics describing a gambler meditating on his own mortality while viewing his dead sweetheart's body in Saint James Infirmary. The record sold well locally\, but Brunswick did not promote it nationally in the advent of the Great Depression. Cab Calloway's cover of Lee's version of "Saint James Infirmary\," recorded the next year\, created a national sensation.    Recording: George E. Lee & His Novelty Singing Orch.\, voc. George E.

The music was written by Vincent Rose\, the lyrics by [John L. Rooney]. It was recorded six times in 1940. Victor Records released the recording by the Sammy Kaye Orchestra with vocals by Tommy Ryan on May 31\, 1940 (catalog #26643\, with the flip side "Maybe"; matrix #51050).

The largest 1940 hit was by Glenn Miller.  Louis Armstrong's 1949 recording charted in the Billboard Top 40. It was an international hit in 1956 for Fats Domino\, and has become a rock and roll standard. It reached number two\, for three weeks on the Billboard Top 40 charts\, becoming his biggest pop hit\, and spent eight non-consecutive weeks at number one on the R&B Best Sellers chart. The version by Fats Domino was also ranked #81 in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

(the first line of Domino's 1950s version of "Blueberry Hill") in reference to pretty girls he dated or wanted to date.  It is one of the songs that the time traveling James Cole enjoys in the film\, Twelve Monkeys\, and the song is later sung by the scientists upon his return to the future.  The song is purportedly named after a "make-out" spot in Taos\, New Mexico.  Joe Edwards' restaurant on the Delmar Loop in St. Louis\, Missouri\, where Chuck Berry frequently plays\, is named after the song.  The Far Side\, a comic written by Gary Larson\, features a comic parodying the lyrics of this song. A man is talking in a phone booth on top of a hill named "Blueberry Hill." He says into the phone "Norm? This is Mitch. ... You were right--I found my drill." The parody is of the line "found my thrill on Blueberry Hill."  Prime Minister of Russia Vladimir Putin made a cover performance of the song on December 10\, 2010 before an audience of international film and television celebrities\, in support of a charity for ill children. Videos of his performance quickly went viral worldwide.	0

COL title VAL A Taste of Honey COL performer VAL Tony Bennett	COL video title VAL Woody Herman - A Taste of Honey COL channel name VAL Erlendur Svavarsson COL description VAL On that ghastly afternoon when John F. Kennedy died\, Woody Herman was recording an album for Phillips. The band was playing Bobby Scott's "A Taste of Honey". Everyone had heard the news and there was in that performance a mournfulness that is not in the arrangement\, not in the notes themselves\, but in the attitude in the band\, whose personnel at that period included Nat Pierce\, Sal Nistico\, Phil Wilson\, and Bill Chase. You can hear it in the recording. It is a striking track\, deeply sad\, and it shows how jazz can reflect public events and the consequent more immediately than any other art. Woody finished the take and cancelled the rest of the date.	1

Wir brauchten früher keine große Reise. Wie wurden braun auf Borkum und auf Sylt. Doch heute sind die Braunen nur noch Weiße. Denn hier wird man ja doch nur tiefgekühlt.  Ja früher gab's noch Hitzefrei. Das Freibad war schon auf im Mai. Ich saß bis in die Nacht vor unserem Haus. Da hatten wir noch Sonnenbrand und Riesenquallen an dem Strand\, und Eis und jeder Schutzmann zog die Jacke aus.  Wann wird's mal wieder richtig Sommer -  ein Sommer wie er früher einmal war? Ja mit Sonnenschein von Juni bis September und nicht so naß und so sibirisch wie im letzten Jahr.  Na na na ... la la la ...  Und was wir da für Hitzewellen hatten Pulloverfabrikanten gingen ein. Da gab es bis zu 40 Grad im Schatten Wir mußten mit dem Wasser sparsam sein.  Die Sonne knallte ins Gesicht da brauchte man die Sauna nicht. Ein Schaf war damals froh wenn man es schor Es war hier wie in Afrika Wer durfte machte FKK Doch heut\, heut summen alle Mücken laut im Chor  Wann wird's mal wieder richtig Sommer -  ein Sommer wie er früher einmal war? Ja mit Sonnenschein von Juni bis September und nicht so naß und so sibirisch wie in diesem Jahr.	1

COL title VAL On the Sunny Side of the Street COL performer VAL Little Stevie Wonder	COL video title VAL François Glorieux plays The Beatles - 11 - In My Life (Debussy) COL channel name VAL François Miet COL description VAL Improvisation on "In my life" in the style of Claude Debussy. La plus grande originalité de cet étonnant LP réside sans doute dans le fait que chaque pièce a été entièrement improvisée. En d'autres termes : jouée spontanément sans préparation\, ni partition. Si François Glorieux est le seul pianiste de notre XXè siècle à s'être aventuré aussi loin dans le domaine de l'improvisation\, il ne révèle ici qu'UN des des multiples aspects de ce "grand art" qu'il pratique comme personne : l'improvisation de style. Et cela tient du miracle! Loin de se contenter d'un "pastiche à la manière de ..."\, il nous démontre comment les noms illustres de l'histoire de la musique auraient pu traiter les admirables mélodies des Beatles. Certains thèmes ont été reproduits intégralement\, d'autres ont été légèrement modifiés ou adaptés à l'image même du compositeur! Et on chercherait en vain un défaut de style ou de construction\, une faute de goût\, une lacune. Comme le disait si bien un critique musical allemand : " François Glorieux est en quelque sorte le faux-monnayeur de l'improvisation\, car c'est si parfait\, si réussi\, qu'on ne sait s'il joue le vrai ou le faux."	0

Originally a French song by Margueritte Monnot entitled 'Le Goualante du Pauvre Jean' sung by Edith Piaf - roughly translated as 'The Popular Song of Poor John'. The music publisher mis-translated the French title into what we all know it as today - or so the story goes....... This particular disc actually reads 'Poor John' on the label. ---superb key change at 00.54.	1

As a second line of attack he decamped to his home with a pile of recording equipment and a few friends to record a series of tongue in cheek cover version.  Randy Stonehill introduces the songs in the style of an OTT egotistical West Coast DJ\, The Surf Duke\, and frankly this has some hysterically funny moments!  Their acoustic version of Norman Greenbaum's "Spirit In The Sky" is absolutely hilarious!  Larry's imitation of Mick Jagger on the Stones' "Shine A Light" is outrageous and the segue of "Bridge Over Troubled Water"\, "Let It Be" and "My Sweet Lord" is suitably respectful . until we get to the disco break in the latter song and Larry again adopting Mick Jagger mode starts singing\, "I'm So Bored".  Call me iconoclastic but these songs deserve to be ripped apart!  After the Clapton rumors of conversion which surface every five years or so\, "Presence Of The Lord" is given a straight rendition although it's worth bearing in mind Larry reports that Clapton wrote it to express escaping from the police who wanted to bust him for drugs!  This CD release closes with two bonus tracks which did not appear on the original vinyl release.  This time they're introduced by Larry's Big Bomber DJ alter-ego on Radio K.R.A.P. and include another great Mick Jagger impersonation on "I Am Waiting".  Mischievous yet making an important contribution cataloguing counterfeit "Christian" culture.  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Larry's Site: http://www.larrynorman.com/ ----------------------------------------------------------------	0

Their original version of the song was a Billboard Top 10 Pop hit\, reaching #6 on the Billboard Hot 100\, and #1 in the Canadian RPM-list in 1965. The song peaked at #8 on Cashbox magazine's R&B chart (Billboard was in a chart recess for R&B listings at that time).

GET HERE Music and Lyrics\, Brenda Russell  You can reach me by railway\, you can reach me by trailway You can reach me on an airplane\, you can reach me with your mind You can reach me by caravan\, cross the desert like an Arab man I don't care how you get here\, just- get here if you can  You can reach me by sailboat\, climb a tree and swing rope to rope Take a sled and slide down slow\, into these arms of mine You can jump on a speedy colt\, cross the border in a blaze of hope I don't care how you get here\, just- get here if you can  There are hills and mountains between us Always something to get over If I had my way\, then surely you would be closer I need you closer  You can windsurf into my life\, take me up on a carpet ride You can make it in a big balloon\, but you better make it soon You can reach me by caravan\, cross the desert like an Arab man I don't care how you get here\, just- get here if you can  I don't care\, I dont care\, I need you right here right now I need you right here\, right now\, right by my side I don't care how you get here\, just- get here if you can.  "Get Here" is a pop ballad written by American singer/songwriter Brenda Russell which became an international hit via a 1990 recording by Oleta Adams\, reaching #4 in the UK and #5 (#8 R&B) in the US.  Brenda Russell had written the song while staying at a penthouse in Stockholm: the tune came to her as she viewed some hot air balloons floating over the city\, a sight Russell recalls set her "really tripping on how many ways you can get to a person" (the eventual song's lyrics include the line: "You can make it in a big balloon but you'd better make it soon"). Although Russell did not pursue the musical ideas that came to her as her current record label saw her as a dance artist and she thought would not be interested in a song such as the one which became "Get Here"\, the song was still in the singer's mind when she woke up the next day: "I don't read or write music [therefore] it's extraordinary if a song is still in my head that I haven't jotted down or recorded. So if it's still in my head overnight\, I think that's something extra special\, it's like somebody trying to tell me something." Russell recorded the song as the title cut of her 1988 album from which it was issued as a single - the album's third - reaching the Top 40 on the Billboard R&B charts.  It was while Oleta Adams was visiting Stockholm that she heard the original Brenda Russell version of "Get Here" playing in a record store and was sufficiently impressed with the song to record it for her 1990 debut album Circle of One. Adams' "Get Here" was issued as a single - after two previous tracks from Circle of One had been released to scant notice - in November 1990; world events at this time gave the song a resonance as an anthem for the US troops in the Gulf War - underscored by the lyrics: "You can reach me by caravan|Cross the desert like an Arab man" - which impelled Adams' single into the Top Ten of the Billboard Hot 100 in the spring of 1991 .  A signature number of Justin Guarini during season #1 of American Idol and included on the Justin Guarini album\, "Get Here" has also been recorded by Vanessa Amorosi\, Paul Anka\, David Archuleta\, Alexia Gardner\, Barbara Mandrell\, Omar Chakil (who wrote French lyrics for his version: "Tu m'as tout donné ")\, Q featuring Tracey Ackerman\, Jennifer Rush\, Livingston Taylor and Jonalyn Viray. A humorous cover\, which featured comedy sound effects after each method of transport mentioned\, was performed by fictional singer Michelle Coffee in the Peter Kay series Phoenix Nights.  The Beautiful South's album Gaze included a song with the same title and\, partially\, similar lyrics - but reversed the theme\, with Paul Heaton protesting his unwillingness to travel any distance at all for his lover. (Sample lyric: "You can get here by helicopter"/"I can barely make Blackpool sands").

COL title VAL Fat Bottom Girls COL performer VAL Hayseed Dixie	COL video title VAL I Didn't Know What Time It Was - Cassandra Wilson COL channel name VAL Willie Jordan COL description VAL I was searching through the YouTube archives for tunes from Cassandra Wilson's 1988 album\, "Blue Skies"\, and I was surprised to find so very few posted here. I first thought that it must be because of some contractual conflict but when I discovered that wasn't the case\, I became downright stunned. By just about anyone's account\, Ms. Wilson's Blue Skies album is considered a masterpiece. Every tune from it is well played by the musicians and what Cass does with the lyrics to songs that have been sung by virtually all of the great jazz singers is something of a revelation. She manages to make all of the tunes seem brand new and never before heard. I think one of the best examples of that is this masterful handling of Rodgers and Hart's "I Didn't Know What Time It Was". While Terri Lyne Carrington keeps a steady fire beneath her\, Cass swings the tune\, beginning and ending some sung phrases with delightful little scats. She then breaks into a fully improvised scat right before Mulgrew Miller scorches us with his highly inventive solo. Special mention should also be made of rock-steady Lonnie Plaxico's bass work throughout\, always vibrant and swinging. I could have chosen any tune from the album to provide as an example of the album's fineness so don't settle on hearing just this tune. If you love jazz\, you've got to cop Cassandra Wilson's "Blue Skies".   Lineup:  Cassandra Wilson - vocals Mulgrew Miller - piano Lonnie Plaxico - bass Terri Lyne Carrington - drums	0

This is proven true\, given the fact that I recently discovered her albums—and I just haven't had my fill. I've searched and purchased everything I could find from such a gifted songstress. Lorez crafts each lyric with such grace and tonality that could easily match (if not surpass) the reigning jazz stylists of the bop/jazz/pop age. She gives each standard a new sense of evocative meaning as far as lyrics are concerned and reinvents the wheel each time she unleashes her enthralling voice. As she once said\, "A lyric is dead until you breathe life into it." This is exactly what she does. Enjoy and listen in HD\, to the lovely—Lorez Alexandria.	0

L'auteur de L'écume des jours a su trouver les mots qui sonnent avec grâce. La direction musicale de Laurent De Wild est un "Voyage au Paradis".  Libération -- 2009 -- Bruno Pfeiffer -- Diane chante Vian tel que -- Un météore a explosé la surface tranquille de la lune : son dernier disque "Docteur Boris et Mister Vian". Le travail enduit de baume les oreilles\, puis le reste de la carcasse. C'est tout simplement extra... Un régal. Vian n'aurait sans doute pas hésité à applaudir « Rue de la flemme ». Quel concentré de swing relâché! Quel modèle de grande chanson (tour de force de la traduction)! Pourquoi  citer seulement  le savoureux « Voyage au Paradis » ? Les onze valent le coup. Le disque passe comme un remède à l'imbécillité de la période actuelle... La profondeur légère de l'interprétation s'offre comme un cadeau. Les chorus de Laurent de Wilde\, huit ou seize mesures maxi\, ne goinfrent pas la mise en place. La complicité de l'ensemble se ressent du respect flagrant que se portent les artistes. Le prochain qui me classe Diane Tell dans la variété\, je l'enjoins : jazzons les idées préconçues.

On that very special night\, the Blind Boys invited some of their favorite musicians to join them: Dr. John\, Preservation Hall Jazz Band\, Henry Butler\, Marva Wright... and Susan Tedeschi.  The set list contained new and old favs -- selections from their New Orleans CD\, as well as songs from the Blind Boys' 4 Grammy-winning albums\, including the great soul-stirring classic\, "People Get Ready."  The packed crowd went wild\, and the whole unforgettable\, historic show was preserved forever on the DVD "The Blind Boys of Alabama - Live in New Orleans" -- from which this clip was taken.  I've always loved this song\, and I'd never heard it done this way. Imo\, it's Susan T. who makes this thing fly. That woman plays and sings like.... like the train really is a comin'! She's just a flat-out GREAT MUSICIAN\, in the purest sense.  Note: I made sure that the audio here is as good as it can possibly be. Ok. Enjoy.  (I claim no copyright ownership whatsoever to any of this material.)  Btw... Can you guess when the Blind Boys first sang together as a band? Hmmm. 1939. (Less than 4 score years after the Civil War!) Wow.	0

COL title VAL Me and Mr. Jones COL performer VAL Barbara Mason	COL video title VAL The Carpenters - Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas (A&M Records 1978) COL channel name VAL ChristmasTimeTV COL description VAL "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" is a song introduced by Judy Garland in the 1944 MGM musical Meet Me in St. Louis. Frank Sinatra later recorded a version with modified lyrics\, which has become more common than the original. The song was written by Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane.  When presented with the original draft lyric\, Garland\, her co-star Tom Drake and director Vincente Minnelli criticized the song as depressing\, and asked Martin to change the lyrics. Though he initially resisted\, Martin made several changes to make the song more upbeat. For example\, the lines "It may be your last / Next year we may all be living in the past" became "Let your heart be light / Next year all our troubles will be out of sight". Garland's version of the song\, which was also released as a single by Decca Records\, became popular among United States troops serving in World War II; her performance at the Hollywood Canteen brought many soldiers to tears.  In 1957\, Frank Sinatra asked Martin to revise the line "Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow". He told Martin\, "The name of my album is A Jolly Christmas. Do you think you could jolly up that line for me?" Martin's new line was "Hang a shining star upon the highest bough". Martin made several other alterations\, changing the song's focus to a celebration of present happiness\, rather than anticipation of a better future. On The Judy Garland Show Christmas Special\, Judy sings the song to her children Joey and Lorna Luft with Sinatra's alternate lyrics.  Have yourself a merry little Christmas  Let your heart be light  From now on  our troubles will be out of sight  Have yourself a merry little Christmas  Make the Yule-tide gay  From now on  our troubles will be miles away   Here were are as in olden days  happy golden days of yore  Faithful friends who are dear to us  gather near to us once more   Through the years we all will be together  If the Fates allow  Hang a shining star upon the highest bough  And have yourself a merry little Christmas now	0

It is an arrangement of (and an "answer song" to) Bo Diddley's "I'm a Man" (which in turn was inspired by Waters' and Willie Dixon's "Hoochie Coochie Man"). "Mannish Boy" features a repeating stop-time figure on one chord throughout the song and is credited to Waters\, Mel London\, and Bo Diddley.  Muddy Waters versions  The original version of "Mannish Boy" was recorded in Chicago on May 24\, 1955\, under the title "Manish Boy." Accompanying Muddy Waters on vocals and guitar were Jimmy Rogers on guitar\, Junior Wells on harmonica\, Fred Below on drums\, and an un-identified female chorus. The original version was the only recording done by Muddy Waters between January 1953 and June 1957 that did not feature Little Walter on harmonica and was one of few studio recordings with Junior Wells.  Muddy Waters recorded several versions of "Mannish Boy" during his career. In 1968\, he recorded it for the Electric Mud album in Marshall Chess' attempt to attract the rock market. After he left Chess\, he recorded it for the 1977 Hard Again album which was produced by Johnny Winter. The song also was included on the live album Muddy "Mississippi" Waters - Live (1979).  Charts and accolades  The song reached #5 during a stay of six weeks in the Billboard R&B chart. The song was Muddy Waters only chart appearance on the UK Singles Chart peaking at #51.  In 1986\, Muddy Waters' original "Mannish Boy" was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame "Classics of Blues Recordings" category. It was also included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's list of the "500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll". "Mannish Boy" is ranked #229 in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the "500 Greatest Songs of All Time".  Cover versions  A cover by Jimi Hendrix appears on the compilation album Blues.  Paul Butterfield covered the song in 1986 on his album The Legendary Paul Butterfield Rides Again.  It was covered by Hindu Love Gods in their album of the same name.  The song also appears on The Bocephus Box\, a three-CD box set by Hank Williams\, Jr.\, released in 2000.  Elliott Murphy covered it in 2005 on Murphy gets Muddy.  The Rolling Stones have often incorporated this song\, among other blues standards\, into their live set\, and it can be heard on the albums Love You Live and Rarities 1971-2003.  Wolfmother did a cover of the song for their special edition version of Cosmic Egg.  Black Stone Cherry performed a heavier version along with Hoochie Coochie Man in October 2009 at Rockaplast in Germany.  It was further rearranged in the 2003 Martin Scorsese documentary film series titled The Blues. In the fifth film\, titled Godfathers and Sons and directed by Marc Levin\, Mannish Boy was redone by The ElectriK Mud Kats (a.k.a. The Electric Mud Band\, Muddy Waters' backing group from his album Electric Mud) with vocals by hip hop artists Chuck D\, Common & Kyle Jason.  Roger Daltrey performed a cover of the song on Jools Holland's New Years show on December 31\, 2010.  A version of the song recorded by Erykah Badu was featured in an H&M TV advert in spring 2011.  Aerosmith performed the song on The Howard Stern Show on January 13\, 1995.	1

Sears' lyrics are most commonly set to one of two melodies: "Carol\," composed by Richard Storrs Willis\, or "Noel\," adapted from an English melody.  Ella's accompanied by Ralph Carmichael & Orchestra.  (Capitol Records)  It came upon the midnight clear\,  That glorious song of old\,  From angels bending near the earth  To touch their harps of gold! Peace on the earth\, good will to men\,  From heaven's all gracious King!  The world in solemn stillness lay  To hear the angels sing.   Still through the cloven skies they come  With peaceful wings unfurled  And still their heavenly music floats  O'er all the weary world;  Above its sad and lowly plains  They bend on hovering wing.  And ever o'er its Babel sounds  The blessed angels sing.  Yet with te woes of sin and strife  The world hath suffered long;  Beneath the angel-strain have rolled  Two thousand years of wrong;  And man\, at war with man\, hears not  The love song which they bring:  O hush the noise\, ye men of strife\,  And hear the angels sing.   For lo! the days are hastening on\,  By prophet bards foretold\,  When\, with the ever-circling years\,  Shall come the Age of Gold;  When peace shall over all the earth  Its ancient splendors fling\,  And all the world give back the song  Which now the angels sing.	0
COL title VAL Keep a Knockin' COL performer VAL Wet Willie	COL video title VAL Michel Legrand Orchestra - What is this Thing Called Love - El Choclo - Perfidia (Stereo) COL channel name VAL ifcopod COL description VAL Perfidia  that imperishable song  we all whistle daily  enjoyed a vogue  recently . Many \,mainly rock music poseurs  touting versions ~   Of course  if Perfidia is given special treatment why not Stairway to the Stars or some such delightful marginalised  standard. Can you think of others  I can. Out of this World.for one.  There's a good Mantovani 1949 version before the famous cascading strings. In fact we could put  infinity to the test lining up whole catalogues of  meritorious songs and some  not quite so. .    This  Perfidia is buried somewhere on the 18 minutes track but all the music  is worth a listen. Interestingly when  Legrand recorded his Cole Porter  double album in 1957 a fullyfledged orchestral version of  What is this thing called love was omitted. 1962s Strings on Fire made amends with  my favourite version of the song and   a stylish reading affording  space for the legrand strings to shine. Depending on where the punctuation is the title reads What is this Thing Called? -- Love? or said in frustration What is this Thing Called Love?  In 1956  Legrand recorded  the album Castles in Spain which included a dapper take on El Choclo complete with a sprightly concertante piano part. This version from Strings on Fire is even better and  eloquent evidence that when he approaches songs afresh  for a  different slant on the melody he has few rivals among the arranger brigade.  There's a mono version of Perfidia by Michel Legrand doing the rounds on YouTube for headphone listening the stereo pressing makes a big difference. The selection of Orchestras typical of  1950s 1960s  music Bert Kaemfert Billy Vaughan ~ did you know Billy Vaughan was a massive seller in the 1950s  my favourite Billy Vaughan  is still Friendly Persuasion  with Pat Boone  you cant really beat that quality of melody written by  respected hero  Dimitri Tiomkin  among the most melodically   gifted of all film composers. Check  his Unforgiven   music from  Burt Lancaster 1960 movie and  from the same time Sundowners  .Both extremely attractive difficult to call it between them. .

COL title VAL Só Danço Samba COL performer VAL Perpetuum Jazzile	COL video title VAL Manhattan Dance Makers - Sleepy Time Gal (1925) COL channel name VAL bsgs98 COL description VAL Sleepy Time Gal Lyrics by Joseph R. Alden and Raymond B. Egan Music by Ange Lorenzo and Richard Whiting Performed by The Manhattan Dance Makers Recorded November 11\, 1925 Harmony H-63  The Manhattan Dance Makers was a Ben Selvin group that recorded for the Harmony and Columbia labels between 1925 and 1929. The group\, at times\, included Earl Oliver\, Hymie Faberman\, Nathan Glantz\, Bennie Krueger\, Harry Reser\, Joe Tarto\, George Hamilton Green.   In 1923 an amateur songwriter\, Joseph Alden\, showed band director\, Ange Lorenzo some lyrics he had written with the title "Sleepy Time Girl."  Lorenzo sat down at the piano\, and in a short time composed the music to go with it.  Even though it was an immediate hit it remained unpublished until composer Richard Whiting and lyricist Ray Egan heard the song and recognized its potential.  They polished it up a little then renamed it "Sleepy Time Gal" and had it published in 1925.  "Sleep Time Gal" has enjoyed many years of popularity through the years. Among the many performers include: The Three Suns\, Herb Alpert\, Tony Bennett\, Pery Como\, Dean Martin\, Dinah Shore\, Les Elgart\, Harry James\, Jerry Vale\, Liberace\, Guy Lombardo\, Norman Luboff\, Mills Brothers\, and Oscar Peterson.  Ange Lorenzo died in 1971\, at the age of 77.  At the funeral\, his long-time friend\, musician Bill Kempf\, played a sang a final tribute to Lorenzo\, "Sleepy Time Gal."  = = = = = = =  (verse 1) Wouldn't it be a change for you and me to stay at home once in a while? We cabaret until the break of day\, I'll bet we've danced many a mile. I'd like to see a movie once more\, They don't keep people stayin' up until four. Wouldn't it be a pleasant novelty to tumble in early once more?  (chorus) Sleepy time gal\, you're turning night into day\, Sleepy time gal\, you've danced the ev'ning away\, Before each silvery star fades out of sight\, Please give me one little kiss\, then let us whisper "goodnight\," It's gettin' late and dear your pillow's waitin'; Sleepy time gal\, when all your dancin' is thru\, Sleepy time gal\, I'll find a cottage for you\, You'll learn to cook and to sew\, What's more you'll love it\, I know\, When you're a stay-at-home\, play-at-home\, Eight o'clock sleepy time gal.  (verse 2) Wouldn't it be a pleasant sight to see a kitchenette only for you? Wouldn't it be a pleasant sight to see\, a table set only for two? I'll get a big Victrola and then\, We'll start in dancing ev'ry new dance again\, Then it will be a pleasant novelty to tumble in just about ten.  (chorus)	0
COL title VAL I'm Ready COL performer VAL Thee Headcoats Sect	COL video title VAL California Ramblers Wally Edwards Orch. - Peanut Vendor 1930 El Manisero COL channel name VAL warholsoup100 COL description VAL Peanut vendor 12-2-1930. 1930 California Ramblers. Columbia 2351 Columbia DC104. First recording of this song by a U.S. group. Yes\, it's the Ramblers\, not the usual sound you might think. The California Ramblers were a popular and prolific jazz group from the 1920s\, that recorded hundreds of songs under many different record labels throughout the 1920s. Three of the members of the band\, Red Nichols\, Jimmy Dorsey\, and Tommy Dorsey\, would go on to front big bands in later decades. The original bandmembers were from Ohio\, but chose the name California Ramblers because they thought people would be less inclined to listen to a jazz band from the Midwest. The Peanut Vendor (original title: El Manisero) is a Cuban song based on a street-seller's cry\, and known as a pregón. It is possibly the most famous piece of music created by a Cuban musician. The Peanut Vendor has been recorded more than 160 times\, sold over a million copies of the sheet music\, and was the first million-selling 78rpm of Cuban music.	0

L'auteur de L'écume des jours a su trouver les mots qui sonnent avec grâce. La direction musicale de Laurent De Wild est un "Voyage au Paradis".  Libération -- 2009 -- Bruno Pfeiffer -- Diane chante Vian tel que -- Un météore a explosé la surface tranquille de la lune : son dernier disque "Docteur Boris et Mister Vian". Le travail enduit de baume les oreilles\, puis le reste de la carcasse. C'est tout simplement extra... Un régal. Vian n'aurait sans doute pas hésité à applaudir « Rue de la flemme ». Quel concentré de swing relâché! Quel modèle de grande chanson (tour de force de la traduction)! Pourquoi  citer seulement  le savoureux « Voyage au Paradis » ? Les onze valent le coup. Le disque passe comme un remède à l'imbécillité de la période actuelle... La profondeur légère de l'interprétation s'offre comme un cadeau. Les chorus de Laurent de Wilde\, huit ou seize mesures maxi\, ne goinfrent pas la mise en place. La complicité de l'ensemble se ressent du respect flagrant que se portent les artistes. Le prochain qui me classe Diane Tell dans la variété\, je l'enjoins : jazzons les idées préconçues.

COL title VAL Take Me Home\, Country Roads COL performer VAL Robby Longo	COL video title VAL Vera Lynn - We'll Meet Again (1939 Novachord Version) COL channel name VAL Travis Bickle COL description VAL Thanks to Kim Damien Eriksen for pointing out (in his very informative comment) that in fact this is a '39 version of the song\, and thanks to Aidan The Lover Boy O'Dwyer too for reminding me to check the comments. "We'll Meet Again" is song made famous by British singer Vera Lynn with music and lyrics written by Ross Parker and Hughie Charles (born Charles Hugh Owen Ferry\, 24 Jul 1907 in Reddish\, Stockport\, Cheshire). The song is one of the most famous songs of the Second World War era\, and resonated with soldiers going off to fight and their families and sweethearts. The assertion that "we'll meet again" is optimistic\, as many soldiers did not survive to see their loved ones again. Indeed\, the meeting place at some unspecified time in the future would have been seen by many who lost loved ones to be heaven.	0

COL title VAL Someday Sweetheart COL performer VAL Jimmy Dorsey and His Orchestra	COL video title VAL Gustav Winckler - Når du ser et stjerneskud (When You Wish Upon a Star) COL channel name VAL stigekalder COL description VAL ★★★ My playlist with Gustav Winckler Christmas songs: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFD92160049A76D3B  Gustav Winckler (1925 - 1979): NÅR DU SER ET STJERNESKUD  This is the Danish version of "When You Wish Upon a Star"\, which was written by Ned Washington and Leigh Harline and introduced in the 1940 Walt Disney movie Pinocchio\, where it is sung by Cliff Edwards.   In Denmark (as in the other Nordic countries + Japan)\, the song has become a Christmas song\, often referring to the Star of Bethlehem. The Danish title roughly translates as "When you see a shooting star". The song is played on television every Christmas Eve's day in the traditional Disney one-hour Christmas cabaret\, and the gathering of the entire family for the watching of this\, is considered a Nordic tradition.  Når du ser et stjerneskud lad dit ønske flyve ud\, da vil alle stjerners herre  høre dig. Bare du af hjertet tror\, da er ingen bøn for stor når et stjerneskud\, der falder  på din vej.  Skæbnen selv er da din lykkes smed\, den blinker til dig ned fra himlens stjerner.  Når du ser et stjerneskud\, da er det et himlens bud om at du skal vinde\, hvad du ønsker dig.  (Danish version by Mogens Dam)  Gustav Winckler was a popular Danish singer\, composer and music publisher. He is widely considered the best Danish crooner ever\, and was often compared to Bing Crosby. In 1957 after qualifying in "Dansk Melodi Grand Prix" to represent Denmark at the Eurovision Song Contest\, he participated in Eurovision Song Contest 1957 where he sung "Skibet skal sejle i nat" ("The ship is leaving tonight") with Birthe Wilke. They ranked number 3\, and stunned television audiences with a 13-second long kiss at the end of their performance. Winckler died in a car accident in 1979.

This acoustic version of Summer Breeze is something of an amalgamation of two songs; we tried to take the best bits from both the original Seals and Crofts version and the well known Isley Brothers cover.   Seals and Croft released the original in 1970\, the single reaching a respectable number 6 in the charts. Interestingly the Isley Brothers version only reached number 16 in the UK charts\, despite being the more recognisable version today.	0

COL title VAL A Taste of Honey COL performer VAL Tony Bennett	COL video title VAL The Beatles - A Taste Of Honey COL channel name VAL DeutschMatheLehrer COL description VAL The Beatles - A Taste Of Honey (Copyright 1963 EMI Records)  "A Taste of Honey" is a pop standard written by Bobby Scott and Ric Marlow. It was originally an instrumental track (or recurring theme) written for the 1960 Broadway version of the 1958 British play A Taste of Honey (which was also made into a film with the same name in 1961). Both the original and a cover by Herb Alpert in 1965 earned the song Grammy Awards. A vocal version of the song\, first recorded by Lenny Welch\, became popular when it was recorded by The Beatles in 1963.  The original recorded versions of the song ("A Taste of Honey"\, "A Taste of Honey (refrain)" and "A Taste of Honey (closing theme)" appeared on Bobby Scott's 1960 album\, also titled A Taste of Honey\, on Atlantic Records (Atlantic 1355). After being used in the film\, the composition won Best Instrumental Theme at the Grammy Awards of 1962.  Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass recorded the most popular instrumental version of this song with a cover on their 1965 album\, Whipped Cream & Other Delights. This recording spent five weeks at #1 on the adult contemporary chart\, reached #7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart\, and won three awards including Record of the Year at the Grammy Awards of 1966.  Martin Denny and The Victor Feldman Quartet each scored minor hits in 1962 with their covers.  Acker Bilk released a version in the UK in January 1963\, reaching #16 in the UK Singles Chart.  Paul Desmond recorded it on his album Glad to be Unhappy in 1963.  Lenny Welch recorded the first vocal version. It was released as a single in September 1962 on the Cadence label and included on his 1963 album Since I Fell for You. This version also credits Lee Morris as a writer but it is not known if it was he who provided the lyrics. This credit does not appear on any covers of the song\, with only Marlow/Scott credited.  Allan Sherman recorded a parody version called "A Waste of Money".   In other news\, I have added the lyrics to this song so you can sing along\, or perhaps learn the song! This is how I learned my first Beatles song! Enjoy! :)  Album: Introducing The Beatles Recorded: February 11\, 1963	1

COL title VAL Mona COL performer VAL Craig McLachlan and Check 1-2	COL video title VAL Mildred Bailey - I Don't Stand A Ghost Of A Chance With You - 1939 COL channel name VAL warholsoup100 COL description VAL Vintage Radio Slideshow. Mildred Bailey (February 27\, 1907 -- December 12\, 1951) was a popular and influential American jazz singer during the 1930s\, known as "The Rockin' Chair Lady" and "Mrs. Swing". Her number one hits were "Please Be Kind"\, "Darn That Dream"\, "Rockin' Chair" and "Says My Heart". In the mid 1930s\, she recorded with her third husband Red Norvo. A dynamic couple\, they earned the nicknames "Mr. and Mrs. Swing". During this period (1936--1939) Norvo recorded for Brunswick (with Bailey as primary vocalist) and Bailey recorded her own set of recordings for Vocalion\, often with Norvo's band. Some of her recordings instead featured members of Count Basie's band. Despite her divorce from Norvo\, she and Red would continue to record together until 1945. Suffering from diabetes and depression (during her adult life Bailey was overweight)\, she only made a few recordings following World War II.  Mildred Bailey died December 12\, 1951\, in Poughkeepsie\, New York\, of heart failure\, aged 44\, chiefly due to her diabetes. Her ashes were scattered.

She opens the song with the verse instead of the chorus. When she gets to the chorus\, she deploys two simultaneous parts\, rhythmically chanting "say it" while the background singers declaim a facsimile of what the Beatles originally sang. After a minute and a half\, she dispenses with what the Beatles had written\, spending the final two minutes funkifying her way through a kaleidoscope of sections involving James Brown like rhythmic declamations of vocals\, various permutations of the chorus\, a complete and sudden break and instrumental vamps. The result is a stunning revisioning of a song that most of us have had burned into our brains for almost 50 years!	0

It is an arrangement of (and an "answer song" to) Bo Diddley's "I'm a Man" (which in turn was inspired by Waters' and Willie Dixon's "Hoochie Coochie Man"). "Mannish Boy" features a repeating stop-time figure on one chord throughout the song and is credited to Waters\, Mel London\, and Bo Diddley.  Muddy Waters versions  The original version of "Mannish Boy" was recorded in Chicago on May 24\, 1955\, under the title "Manish Boy." Accompanying Muddy Waters on vocals and guitar were Jimmy Rogers on guitar\, Junior Wells on harmonica\, Fred Below on drums\, and an un-identified female chorus. The original version was the only recording done by Muddy Waters between January 1953 and June 1957 that did not feature Little Walter on harmonica and was one of few studio recordings with Junior Wells.  Muddy Waters recorded several versions of "Mannish Boy" during his career. In 1968\, he recorded it for the Electric Mud album in Marshall Chess' attempt to attract the rock market. After he left Chess\, he recorded it for the 1977 Hard Again album which was produced by Johnny Winter. The song also was included on the live album Muddy "Mississippi" Waters - Live (1979).  Charts and accolades  The song reached #5 during a stay of six weeks in the Billboard R&B chart. The song was Muddy Waters only chart appearance on the UK Singles Chart peaking at #51.  In 1986\, Muddy Waters' original "Mannish Boy" was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame "Classics of Blues Recordings" category. It was also included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's list of the "500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll". "Mannish Boy" is ranked #229 in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the "500 Greatest Songs of All Time".  Cover versions  A cover by Jimi Hendrix appears on the compilation album Blues.  Paul Butterfield covered the song in 1986 on his album The Legendary Paul Butterfield Rides Again.  It was covered by Hindu Love Gods in their album of the same name.  The song also appears on The Bocephus Box\, a three-CD box set by Hank Williams\, Jr.\, released in 2000.  Elliott Murphy covered it in 2005 on Murphy gets Muddy.  The Rolling Stones have often incorporated this song\, among other blues standards\, into their live set\, and it can be heard on the albums Love You Live and Rarities 1971-2003.  Wolfmother did a cover of the song for their special edition version of Cosmic Egg.  Black Stone Cherry performed a heavier version along with Hoochie Coochie Man in October 2009 at Rockaplast in Germany.  It was further rearranged in the 2003 Martin Scorsese documentary film series titled The Blues. In the fifth film\, titled Godfathers and Sons and directed by Marc Levin\, Mannish Boy was redone by The ElectriK Mud Kats (a.k.a. The Electric Mud Band\, Muddy Waters' backing group from his album Electric Mud) with vocals by hip hop artists Chuck D\, Common & Kyle Jason.  Roger Daltrey performed a cover of the song on Jools Holland's New Years show on December 31\, 2010.  A version of the song recorded by Erykah Badu was featured in an H&M TV advert in spring 2011.  Aerosmith performed the song on The Howard Stern Show on January 13\, 1995.	0

COL video title VAL Julie Felix & John Renbourn ''Changes''(P.Ochs) (1966) COL channel name VAL MrDjango1953 COL description VAL Julie Felix & John Renbourn ''Changes'' (P.Ochs) Absolutely beautiful rendition of the song by the late great Phil Ochs.From Julie's classic album ''Changes''. A really wonderful lyric(see below) and gorgeous back up guitar by John Renbourn and Danny Thompson on bass  CHANGES by Phil Ochs  Sit by my side\, come as close as the air\, Share in a memory of grey; and wander in my words\,and dream about the pictures That I played of changes.  Green leaves of summer turn red in the fall To browns and to yellows they fade. And then they have to die\, trapped within the circle time parade of changes.  Scenes of my young years were warm in my mind\, Visions of shadows that shine. Til one day I returned and found they were the Victims of the vine of changes.  The world's spinning madly\, it drifts in the dark Swings through a hollow of haze\, A race around the stars\, a journey through The universe ablaze with changes.  Moments of magic will glow in the night All fears of the forest are gone But when the morning breaks they're swept away by golden drops of dawn\, of changes.  Passions will part to a strange melody. As fires will sometimes burn cold. Like petals in the wind\, we're puppets to the silver strings of souls\, of changes.  Your tears will be trembling\, now we're somewhere else\, One last glass of wine we will pour  I'll kiss you one more time\, and leave you on the rolling river shore of changes.	0

COL title VAL Moon River COL performer VAL Paul Anka	COL video title VAL Eddi Reader MOON RIVER COL channel name VAL daveinprogress3 COL description VAL It is always such a joy to listen to the tones of Scottish icon Eddi Reader. The singer has such exquisite sensibilities and respectfully memorialises standards such as this one\, as well as her original compositions and collaborations. The mark of a great singer is the ability to cover a song like 'Moon River'\, one of the most recorded tunes in history\, and still make it her own. Now more than half a century old\, the Henry Mancini classic penned for the Audrey Hepburn movie 'Breakfast at Tiffanys'\, is in truly safe hands with Ms Reader. It is delivered with such intimacy but at the same time\, potency and soul.	1

De la mano de Mitch Miller\, director artístico de la casa Columbia\, aplicó el inexorable principio de que\, cuantos peores eran los arreglos y las letras de los temas\, mas beneficio económico para la discográfica. onsiguió grabar un par de duets con Frank Sinatra en 1950 y a partir de ahí le sobrevino la fama y la popularidad. Tuvo su propio show televisivo e incluso Hollywood llamó a su puerta para que participara junto a Bing Crosby y Danny Kaye en algunas comedias musicales siendo la mas celebre el film de Michael Curtiz\, "White Christmas".No obstante lo dicho\, Rosemary Clooney\, se acercó tardíamente al jazz y grabó una par de magníficos álbumes para Columbia: "The Best Of Hollywood" con la orquesta del trompetista\, Harry James\, y "Blue Rose"\, su obra mas conseguida y un disco que pudo ser memorable con la orquesta de Duke Ellington. Es la tía sanguínea del actual actor George Clooney.

The music was written by Vincent Rose\, the lyrics by [John L. Rooney]. It was recorded six times in 1940. Victor Records released the recording by the Sammy Kaye Orchestra with vocals by Tommy Ryan on May 31\, 1940 (catalog #26643\, with the flip side "Maybe"; matrix #51050). Gene Krupa's version was issued on the Okeh label (#5672) on June 3. Other 1940 recordings were by: Glenn Miller on Bluebird (10768)\, Kay Kyser\, Russ Morgan\, Gene Autry (also in the 1941 film The Singing Hill)\, Connee Boswell\, and Jimmy Dorsey. The largest 1940 hit was by Glenn Miller.  Louis Armstrong's 1949 recording charted in the Billboard Top 40. It was an international hit in 1956 for Fats Domino\, and has become a rock and roll standard. It reached number two\, for three weeks on the Billboard Top 40 charts\, becoming his biggest pop hit\, and spent eight non-consecutive weeks at number one on the R&B Best Sellers chart. The version by Fats Domino was also ranked #81 in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. The song was Domino's greatest hit and remains the song most associated with him.

(the first line of Domino's 1950s version of "Blueberry Hill") in reference to pretty girls he dated or wanted to date.  It is one of the songs that the time traveling James Cole enjoys in the film\, Twelve Monkeys\, and the song is later sung by the scientists upon his return to the future.  The song is purportedly named after a "make-out" spot in Taos\, New Mexico.  Joe Edwards' restaurant on the Delmar Loop in St. Louis\, Missouri\, where Chuck Berry frequently plays\, is named after the song.  The Far Side\, a comic written by Gary Larson\, features a comic parodying the lyrics of this song. A man is talking in a phone booth on top of a hill named "Blueberry Hill." He says into the phone "Norm? This is Mitch. ... You were right--I found my drill." The parody is of the line "found my thrill on Blueberry Hill."  Prime Minister of Russia Vladimir Putin made a cover performance of the song on December 10\, 2010 before an audience of international film and television celebrities\, in support of a charity for ill children. Videos of his performance quickly went viral worldwide.	0

Why should our magical moments of madness Be leaving me with such a feeling of sadness? I know I am playing a forbidden game For the girl that I love is not sharing my name.  There isn't anything special about her But try as I may\, life means nothing without her Perhaps I'm a fool to be hoping in vain But I know that I'm playing a forbidden game.  No one can tell me how long love will last If the future will bring me much more than the past Should I show her I worry? I don't think I dare When my happiness lies in each moment we share.  I'll go on loving her\, just as before For she's all that I want\, and I ask nothing more And if things should go wrong\, I must take all the blame For you're bound to get hurt playing forbidden games.	0

This expresses my idea of democracy.  ~Abraham Lincoln~  Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.  ~Martin Luther King Jnr~  Let every nation know\, whether it wishes us well or ill\, that we shall pay any price\, bear any burden\, meet any hardship\, support any friend\, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.  ~John F. Kennedy~  I believe that\, as long as there is plenty\, poverty is evil.  ~Robert F. Kennedy~  I'm not claiming divinity. I've never claimed purity of soul. I've never claimed to have the answers to life. I only put out songs and answer questions as honestly as I can... But I still believe in peace\, love and understanding.  ~John Lennon~  OTIS REDDING  LYRICS: I was born by a river in this little old tent Oh just like this river I've been running ever since It's been a long\, long time coming But I know\, but I know a change is gotta come Oh yes it is On my!  It's been too hard living\, oh my And I'm afraid to die I don't know what's up there Beyond the clouds  It's been a long long time coming But I know\, but I know a change is gotta come Oh yes it is On my!  There was a time I would go to my brother I asked my brother\, "Will you help me please?" He turned me down and then I ask my dear mother\, oh I said "Mother!" I said "Mother! I'm down on my knees"   It's been a time that I thought Lord this couldn't last for very long But somehow I thought I was still able to try to carry on It's been a long\, long time coming But I know a change is gonna come Oh\, yes it is  Just like I said\, I went to my little bitty brother\, my littele brother I asked my brother "Brother help me please?" He turned me down and then I go to my little mother\, my dear mother I said "Mother!" I said "Mother! I'm down on my knees"   But there was a time that I thought Lord this couldn't last for very long But somehow I thought I was still able to try to carry on It's been a long\, long time coming But I know\, but I know a change is gotta come Oh yes it will  So tired of standing by myself You know that I know that a change is gotta come  Artist: Otis Redding Album: Otis Blue Year: 1965 Song: A Change Is Gonna Come	0

The music was written by Vincent Rose\, the lyrics by [John L. Rooney]. It was recorded six times in 1940. Victor Records released the recording by the Sammy Kaye Orchestra with vocals by Tommy Ryan on May 31\, 1940 (catalog #26643\, with the flip side "Maybe"; matrix #51050). Gene Krupa's version was issued on the Okeh label (#5672) on June 3. Other 1940 recordings were by: Glenn Miller on Bluebird (10768)\, Kay Kyser\, Russ Morgan\, Gene Autry (also in the 1941 film The Singing Hill)\, Connee Boswell\, and Jimmy Dorsey. The largest 1940 hit was by Glenn Miller.  Louis Armstrong's 1949 recording charted in the Billboard Top 40. It was an international hit in 1956 for Fats Domino\, and has become a rock and roll standard. It reached number two\, for three weeks on the Billboard Top 40 charts\, becoming his biggest pop hit\, and spent eight non-consecutive weeks at number one on the R&B Best Sellers chart. The version by Fats Domino was also ranked #81 in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. The song was Domino's greatest hit and remains the song most associated with him.

(the first line of Domino's 1950s version of "Blueberry Hill") in reference to pretty girls he dated or wanted to date.  It is one of the songs that the time traveling James Cole enjoys in the film\, Twelve Monkeys\, and the song is later sung by the scientists upon his return to the future.  The song is purportedly named after a "make-out" spot in Taos\, New Mexico.  Joe Edwards' restaurant on the Delmar Loop in St. Louis\, Missouri\, where Chuck Berry frequently plays\, is named after the song.  The Far Side\, a comic written by Gary Larson\, features a comic parodying the lyrics of this song. A man is talking in a phone booth on top of a hill named "Blueberry Hill." He says into the phone "Norm? This is Mitch. ... You were right--I found my drill." The parody is of the line "found my thrill on Blueberry Hill."  Prime Minister of Russia Vladimir Putin made a cover performance of the song on December 10\, 2010 before an audience of international film and television celebrities\, in support of a charity for ill children. Videos of his performance quickly went viral worldwide.	0

COL title VAL Gimmie Shelter COL performer VAL Michael Hedges	COL video title VAL Mike Bloomfield's Electric Flag with Erma Franklin - Big Boss Man COL channel name VAL Erwin Boermans COL description VAL Live at the Carousel Ballroom\, 21th of April 1968  Erma Franklin - vocals Mike Bloomfield - lead guitar Terry Clements - tenor sax Virgil Gonsalves - baritone sax\, flute Stemsy Hunter - alto sax Marcus Doubleday - trumpet Herbie Rich - organ (possibly some baritone sax on 5) Harvey Brooks - bass Nick Gravenites - lead vocals  Erma Franklin is sister to the well-known Aretha. Erma’s career for Shout! Records resulted in several single releases in 1967 including Big Boss Man  This recording was made when Erma took the stage at the Carousel Ballroom in San Francisco for three nights in April from the 19th to the 21st in 1968. Backing her was Mike Bloomfield’s Electric Flag\, a blues rock group. Much of the research done in identifying the date\, venue and personnel was by Dave M of the westcoastacidandpsychedelia Yahoo group. Says Dave: “The week before at the Carousel (April 14\, 1968)\, there had been an unscheduled Sunday show and jam session featuring Quicksilver Messenger Service and numerous other musicians. The tape circulates\, and since Gary Duncan jokes about Easter Sunday\, it makes it easy to reliably date the show. All this points to another Sunday jam session\, so if I had to guess I would pick Sunday\, April 21 for the date of this show. Anyway\, that’s my story and I’m sticking to it.”	0

COL title VAL Deep River COL performer VAL Marian Anderson	COL video title VAL BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band COL channel name VAL JohnMcEuenMusic COL description VAL Music and lyrics by Jimmy Driftwood:   Jimmy Driftwood was a high school principal and history teacher who loved to sing\, play instruments and write songs. Mr. Driftwood wrote many songs\, all for the sole purpose of helping his students learn about this battle and other historical events. But this song turned out to be so popular that it won the 1959 Grammy Award for Song Of The Year (awarded in 1960 for musical accomplishments in 1959). Johnny Horton also won the 1959 Grammy Award for Best Country And Western Performance for his recording of this song. "The Battle of New Orleans\," is about a battle in the War of 1812\, and it became one of the biggest selling hits of 1959.   After the Battle of New Orleans\, which Andrew Jackson won on January the 8th eighteen and fifteen\, the boys played the fiddle again that night\, only they changed the name of it from the battle of a place in Ireland to the Eighth of January. Years passed and in about nineteen and forty-five an Arkansas school teacher slowed the tune down and put words to it and that song is The Battle Of New Orleans and I will try to sing it for you.   Well\, in eighteen and fourteen we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississip. We took a little bacon and we took a little beans\, And we caught the bloody British near the town of New Orleans.  We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin. There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago. We fired once more and they began to runnin' down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.  Well\, I see'd Mars Jackson walkin down the street talkin' to a pirate by the name of Jean Lafitte [pronounced La-feet] He gave Jean a drink that he brung from Tennessee and the pirate said he'd help us drive the British in the sea.  The French said Andrew\, you'd better run\, for Packingham's a comin' with a bullet in his gun. Old Hickory said he didn't give a dang\, he's gonna whip the britches off of Colonel Packingham.  We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin. There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago. We fired once more and they began to runnin' down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.  Well\, we looked down the river and we see'd the British come\, and there must have been a hundred of 'em beatin' on the drum. They stepped so high and they made their bugles ring while we stood by our cotton bales and didn't say a thing.  Old Hickory said we could take 'em by surprise if we didn't fire a musket til we looked 'em in the eyes. We held our fire til we see'd their faces well\, then we opened up with squirrel guns and really gave a yell.  We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin. There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago. We fired once more and they began to runnin' down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.  Well\, we fired our cannon til the barrel melted down\, so we grabbed an alligator and we fought another round. We filled his head with cannon balls and powdered his behind\, and when they tetched the powder off\, the gator lost his mind.  We'll march back home but we'll never be content till we make Old Hickory the people's President. And every time we think about the bacon and the beans\, we'll think about the fun we had way down in New Orleans.  We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin\, But there wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago. We fired once more and they began to runnin' down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.  Well\, they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go. They ran so fast the hounds couldn't catch 'em down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.  We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin. But there wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago. We fired once more and they began to runnin' down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.	0

Richards was blinded in the left eye at the age of four in an archery accident\, and lost sight in the right eye as well some years later. He first began playing in a group called The Five Pearls while still a teen in the 1950s. His first appearance on record was a single titled "All About Ann"\, released on Cincinnati\, Ohio label Fraternity Records. He moved to Los Angeles with an ensemble in the early 1960s\, but his band failed and he returned to West Virginia. Later in the 1960s he moved to New York. He played the uptown East Side local Bar's (Malachy's II) (72nd & Lexington) and eventually found success in New York.He released his debut album on Warner Bros. Records in 1970. He scored two minor hit singles in the US in the early 1970s. Further releases followed later in the decade\, as did a third hit in 1980. On September 1\, 2011 Turley Richards Said "My! the world is crazy. I just found out this week that Richard Turley (my given name before changing it) on Fraternity Records in 1959 song 'Making Love With My Baby' has put me in the Rockabilly Hall of fame. I'm so flattered."  Lyrics : My World Is Empty Without You\, babe. My World Is Empty Without You\, babe. And as I go my way alone\, I find it hard for me to carry on. I need your strength\,  I need your tender touch I need the love\, my dear\, I miss so much.  My World Is Empty Without You\, babe. My World Is Empty Without You\, babe. From this old world I try to hide my face\, But from this loneliness there's no hiding place. Inside this cold and empty house I dwell\, in darkness with memories I know so well.  I need your love more than before\,  I can hardly carry on anymore. My World Is Empty Without You\, babe\,  without you babe\,without you babe\, My mind and soul have felt like this\, Since love between us no more exist.  And each time that darkness falls\, if finds me alone with these four walls.  My World Is Empty Without You\, babe. My World Is Empty Without You\, babe.

The critical success of the album Shotgun Willie (1973)\, combined with the critical and commercial success of Red Headed Stranger (1975) and Stardust (1978)\, made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music. He was one of the main figures of outlaw country\, a subgenre of country music that developed in the late 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the Nashville sound. Nelson has acted in over 30 films\, co-authored several books\, and has been involved in activism for the use of biofuels and the legalization of marijuana. #WillieNelson #"PleaseComeHomeForChristmas #CountryChristmas #Christmassong #RonjasCountryMusic #RonjaGM	0

Leur culpabilité est extrêmement controversée aussi bien à l'époque que par la suite\, et plusieurs œuvres artistiques leur ont rendu hommage.  Paroles Françaises de Georges Moustaki\, enregistrée en 1971 par Les Compagnons de la Chanson  Comme en Europe\, les années 1919-1920 sont difficiles aux États-Unis : il faut reconvertir l'économie de guerre et faire face à l'inflation. La fin du dirigisme étatique mis en place en 1917 et la montée du syndicalisme provoquent de nombreuses grèves dans tout le pays. En 1919\, on recense 4\,1 millions de grévistes qui réclament de meilleurs salaires et une réduction du temps de travail. Les grèves dégénèrent en violences et donnent lieu à des affrontements dans plusieurs grandes villes\, comme à Boston1.  Face à ce climat social\, l'année 1925 est marquée par de nombreux attentats anarchistes : les responsables politiques sont touchés\, comme le maire de Seattle ou celui de Cleveland\, chez lequel une bombe explose. Les bureaux de la banque Morgan à Wall Street sont soufflés par un attentat qui fait 38 morts et 200 blessés2. Les autorités prennent des mesures de répression contre les anarchistes mais aussi contre les communistes et les socialistes américains. Certains sont emprisonnés\, d'autres contraints de s'exiler. L'opinion publique amalgame les grévistes\, les étrangers et « les Rouges ». Elle craint la progression du bolchévisme en Europe\, le terrorisme de gauche et se méfie des immigrés récemment arrivés qui parlent à peine l'anglais. Cette période est connue sous le terme de « Peur rouge ».  Le premier procès débute le 22 juin 1920. Un certain nombre de témoins à charge qui n'ont vu le braquage que de loin affirment avoir « reconnu » des Italiens\, notamment l'un portant une moustache comme celle de Vanzetti\, le débat portant sur la longueur de cette moustache. Les témoins à décharge\, des immigrés italiens supposés être d'accointance avec les milieux anarchistes\, sont ignorés bien qu'ils leur fournissent un alibi à Vanzetti1.  Le 16 août 1920\, Vanzetti seul est condamné pour le premier braquage de 12 à 15 ans de prison\, Nicola Sacco ayant pu prouver qu'il avait pointé à l'usine le jour de ce premier braquage.  Le second procès qui a lieu à Dedham du 31 mai au 14 juillet 1921 met surtout en scène l'expertise en balistique\, encore balbutiante à cette époque\, Vanzetti portant selon l’accusation un pistolet de calibre 38 qui aurait appartenu à l’une des victimes et Sacco un Colt automatique de calibre 32 dont les quatre balles trouvées sur les lieux du braquage avaient été tirées par un pistolet de même calibre. Ce second procès les condamne tous les deux à la peine capitale pour les crimes de South Braintree\, dans la banlieue de Boston\, malgré le manque de preuves formelles. Carlo Tresca et Aldino Felicani (vieil ami de Vanzetti)\, deux militants de l'Industrial Workers of the World et quelques représentants de la bourgeoisie libérale bostonienne lancent une campagne médiatique nationale et internationale en leur faveur\, montant dès le 9 mai un comité de défense qui parviendra à lever pendant 7 ans un fonds de 300 000 dollars\, fonds dans lequel puisera leur avocat californien Fred Moore\, spécialisé dans les procès politiques\, pour effectuer ses propres enquêtes5. Dès lors\, des comités de défense se mettent en place dans le monde entier pour sensibiliser l'opinion sur cette injustice : Benito Mussolini prend même leur défense6. Comme Sacco en 1923\, Vanzetti est placé début 1925 en hôpital psychiatrique. Le 12 mai 1926\, leur condamnation à mort est confirmée. En novembre 1925\, un bandit dénommé Celestino Madeiros\, cependant déjà condamné à mort dans une autre affaire7\, avoue de sa prison être l'auteur\, avec des membres du gang de Joe Morelli\, du braquage de South Braintree\, mais le juge Webster Thayer (en)\, vieil Américain de souche blanche qui n'aimait ni les Italiens\, ni les anarchistes6\, refuse de rouvrir le dossier. Malgré une mobilisation internationale intense8 et le report à plusieurs reprises de l'exécution\, Nicola Sacco\, Bartolomeo Vanzetti et Celestino Madeiros sont exécutés par chaise électrique dans la nuit du 22 au 23 août 1927\, à la Prison de Charlestown (en) dans la banlieue de Boston\, par le célèbre bourreau Robert G. Elliott9\, suscitant une immense réprobation.	0

In December of 2012\, he laid down tracks with two of his idols—the legendary Ron Carter and the estimable Kenny Barron—and dubbed their group the Thrasher Dream Trio. The eponymous debut from that band\, featuring fifteen tracks recorded at those sessions\, was\, not surprisingly\, a strong and classy affair filled with standards\, some originals\, and other jazz-friendly fare\, such as Stevie Wonder's "Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing" and Burt Bacharach's "Promises\, Promises."   At the time of that album's release\, those last-mentioned tracks could simply be viewed as part of the well-rounded program. But looking back now\, it actually seems like they were dropped as hints of what was to come. About a year-and-a-half after that first Thrasher Dream Trio album was recorded\, Gibbs brought the band together again to lay things down for We're Back (Whaling City Sound\, 2014)\, a jazz-does-R&B project with A-list guests—vibraphonist Warren Wolf\, saxophonist Steve Wilson\, and organist Larry Goldings. That album offered multiple helpings of Wonder and Earth\, Wind & Fire along with single servings of Bacharach\, Marvin Gaye\, Miles Davis\, and the Average White Band. As on the trio's first album\, the sparks were flying. The playing field\, however\, had changed a bit.   For this\, the third go-around for this group\, Gibbs does it again\, tweaking the formula without altering the essence of the trio. This time he turned the focus toward pop-ish material from the '50s and '60s—the work of Bacharach\, Henry Mancini\, Michel Legrand\, and others of that ilk—and put an audience in front of the band\, recording live at Systems Two Recording Studio. Guests are part of the package again—now it's trumpeter Roy Hargrove and vocalist Cassandra Wilson\, each appearing on a few tracks—and they help to add another wrinkle or two to the project without drawing focus away from the trio.   The album opens on a fluid "Wives And Lovers" that allows Barron's lyricism to shine through\, gives Carter a chance to step into the spotlight\, and puts Gibbs' brushwork at center stage. From there\, the trio moves on with an unusually upbeat take on "The Summer Knows\," a Wilson-enhanced version of "The Look Of Love" that moves from bossa nova to swing\, and a variety of other familiar hits of yesteryear. Hargrove joins in for "On A Clear Day\," quoting Ellington at one point and playfully trading solos with Gibbs; Vince Guaraldi's cheerfulness shines through on a perky trio performance of his "Cast Your Fate To The Wind"; "More" is transformed from a stale confection into an enjoyable swinger; and "Watch What Happens" happens twice—first as a cheerful\, Brazilian-based instrumental\, then as a swing-centered feature for Wilson.   Along the way there are plenty of other bright spots—an appropriately noir-ish "What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life?" with Hargrove on flugelhorn\, a leisurely stroll through "Girl Talk"—and plenty of moments that serve as simple reminders as to why Barron and Carter are loved\, respected\, and emulated the world over. Their time and taste are impeccable\, and when married to Gibbs' in-the-tradition drumming\, you know the music is going to go in the right direction every time.

COL title VAL Love of the Common People COL performer VAL Marty Robbins Jr.	COL video title VAL That's All By Mel Torme COL channel name VAL texpaco COL description VAL Mel Tormé was an American musician and singer best known for his classic jazz vocals.  He was also a jazz composer and arranger\, a drummer\, an actor in radio\, film\, and television\, and the author of five books.  He co-wrote the classic holiday song "The Christmas Song" ("Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire") with Bob Wells.  In 1944 he formed the vocal quintet "Mel Tormé and His Mel-Tones"\, modeled on Frank Sinatra and The Pied Pipers.  His appearance in the 1947 film musical "Good News" made him a teen idol for several years.  His 1949 composition "California Suite" became Capitol Records' first 12-inch LP album.  His recording of "Careless Hands" was his only #1 hit\, although "Again" and "Blue Moon" became his signature tunes.

COL title VAL Tired of Waiting for You COL performer VAL Little Angels	COL video title VAL Perez Prado - Guaglione (1958) COL channel name VAL Moraito COL description VAL Perez Prado (1958) Guaglione is a Neapolitan song with music by Giuseppe Fanciulli and words by Nicola "Nisa" Salerno. It was the winning song at the IV Napoli Song Festival broadcast by radio in 1956. The song's title means simply "boy" in Neapolitan language but as slang translates to "street bum"\, "urchin"\, "back street boy"\, "corner boy" or "street tough". The word guaglione has appeared as "wallyo" in New York immigrant slang. The song has been covered by various artists\, including Italian bandleader Renzo Arbore\, and Italian singers Claudio Villa\, Aurelio Fierro and Renato Carosone. Under the title "The Man Who Plays the Mandolino"\, with a lyric in English\, Dean Martin sang it in 1956 after Fred Raphael of Walt Disney Music Company obtained for Disney the U.S. publishing rights. The best known version of "Guaglione" was recorded by the Cuban bandleader Perez Prado in 1958 as an uptempo mambo tune. As a mambo\, the track rose to fame in 1995 after it was used for the Guinness advert "Anticipation". It has since been featured as the intro music for the 1996 video game Kingdom O' Magic\, and more recently as the opening music for the television showJimmy's Farm. The song is one of Disney's biggest profit makers. Written by G. Fanciulli &\, Nisa and produced by Herman Diaz\, Jr. All music or related performances remain the sole property of their respective copyright holders.

COL title VAL Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas COL performer VAL The Baseballs	COL video title VAL The Carpenters - Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas (A&M Records 1978) COL channel name VAL ChristmasTimeTV COL description VAL "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" is a song introduced by Judy Garland in the 1944 MGM musical Meet Me in St. Louis. Frank Sinatra later recorded a version with modified lyrics\, which has become more common than the original. The song was written by Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane.  When presented with the original draft lyric\, Garland\, her co-star Tom Drake and director Vincente Minnelli criticized the song as depressing\, and asked Martin to change the lyrics. Though he initially resisted\, Martin made several changes to make the song more upbeat. For example\, the lines "It may be your last / Next year we may all be living in the past" became "Let your heart be light / Next year all our troubles will be out of sight". Garland's version of the song\, which was also released as a single by Decca Records\, became popular among United States troops serving in World War II; her performance at the Hollywood Canteen brought many soldiers to tears.  In 1957\, Frank Sinatra asked Martin to revise the line "Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow". He told Martin\, "The name of my album is A Jolly Christmas. Do you think you could jolly up that line for me?" Martin's new line was "Hang a shining star upon the highest bough". Martin made several other alterations\, changing the song's focus to a celebration of present happiness\, rather than anticipation of a better future. On The Judy Garland Show Christmas Special\, Judy sings the song to her children Joey and Lorna Luft with Sinatra's alternate lyrics.  Have yourself a merry little Christmas  Let your heart be light  From now on  our troubles will be out of sight  Have yourself a merry little Christmas  Make the Yule-tide gay  From now on  our troubles will be miles away   Here were are as in olden days  happy golden days of yore  Faithful friends who are dear to us  gather near to us once more   Through the years we all will be together  If the Fates allow  Hang a shining star upon the highest bough  And have yourself a merry little Christmas now	1

On that very special night\, the Blind Boys invited some of their favorite musicians to join them: Dr. John\, Preservation Hall Jazz Band\, Henry Butler\, Marva Wright... and Susan Tedeschi.  The set list contained new and old favs -- selections from their New Orleans CD\, as well as songs from the Blind Boys' 4 Grammy-winning albums\, including the great soul-stirring classic\, "People Get Ready."  The packed crowd went wild\, and the whole unforgettable\, historic show was preserved forever on the DVD "The Blind Boys of Alabama - Live in New Orleans" -- from which this clip was taken.  I've always loved this song\, and I'd never heard it done this way. Imo\, it's Susan T. who makes this thing fly. That woman plays and sings like.... like the train really is a comin'! She's just a flat-out GREAT MUSICIAN\, in the purest sense.  Note: I made sure that the audio here is as good as it can possibly be. Ok. Enjoy.  (I claim no copyright ownership whatsoever to any of this material.)  Btw... Can you guess when the Blind Boys first sang together as a band? Hmmm. 1939. (Less than 4 score years after the Civil War!) Wow.	1

Known as "Rompin' Ronnie" Hawkins or "The Hawk\," he was a key player in the 1960s rock scene in Toronto and for the next 40 years\, performed all over North America\, recording more than twenty-five albums. His best-known hits are "Forty Days" and "Mary Lou" (about the song narrator's experiences with a golddigging woman)\, both were major hits for him in 1959.  At the age of nine\, his family moved to nearby Fayetteville. After graduating from high school\, he studied physical education at the University of Arkansas where he formed his first band\, The Hawks\, touring with them throughout Arkansas\, Oklahoma and Missouri. Hawkins also owned and operated the Rockwood Club in Fayetteville where some of Rock music's earliest pioneers came to play including Jerry Lee Lewis\, Carl Perkins\, Roy Orbison and Conway Twitty.  Ronnie Hawkins came to Canada in 1958. His first gig was at the Golden Rail in Hamilton\, Ontario where he became an overnight success. It was a result of Hawkins success in Hamilton that he decided to move to Canada permanently. His career spans over five decades and 25 records. His hits include\, "Forty Days"\, "Mary Lou"\, and "Hey Bo Diddley".   In 1958\, he moved to Canada with the Hawks and made Peterborough\, Ontario his permanent home. Gradually the members of the Hawks\, except for Levon Helm\, were replaced with talented Canadians Robbie Robertson\, Rick Danko\, Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson. This was the line-up that was to later become The Band.  In 1975 Bob Dylan cast him as 'Bob Dylan' in the movie Renaldo and Clara.  His 1984 LP\, 'Making It Again'\, garnered him a Juno Award as Canada's best Country Male Vocalist. Playing with The Band\, Hawkins helped tear down the Berlin Wall in 1989 and performed at President Bill Clinton's 1992 inaugural party. In addition to his music\, he has also become an accomplished actor\, hosting his own television show "Honky Tonk" in the early 1980s and appearing in such films as Heaven's Gate with his friend Kris Kristofferson and Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II.  October 4\, 2002 was declared "Ronnie Hawkins Day" by the city of Toronto when Hawkins was inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame in recognition of his lifetime contribution to music and his generous support of the Schizophrenia Society of Ontario and other charitable organizations. Ronnie Hawkins was inducted into the Canadian Music Industry Hall of Fame at the Canadian Music Industry Awards on March 4\, 2004. His pioneering contribution to the genre has also been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame.  In recent years\, Ronnie Hawkins had reportedly been battling pancreatic cancer. His allegedly miraculous recovery\, attributed to everything from psychic healers to native herbal medicine\, is featured in the film Ronnie Hawkins: Still Alive and Kicking.  In 2005\, he was awarded an honorary degree from Laurentian University.  Also Ronnie recently has reissued most of his albums on CD through Unidisc Music Inc.	0

COL title VAL A Taste of Honey COL performer VAL Woody Herman	COL video title VAL The Beatles - A Taste Of Honey COL channel name VAL DeutschMatheLehrer COL description VAL The Beatles - A Taste Of Honey (Copyright 1963 EMI Records)  "A Taste of Honey" is a pop standard written by Bobby Scott and Ric Marlow. It was originally an instrumental track (or recurring theme) written for the 1960 Broadway version of the 1958 British play A Taste of Honey (which was also made into a film with the same name in 1961). Both the original and a cover by Herb Alpert in 1965 earned the song Grammy Awards. A vocal version of the song\, first recorded by Lenny Welch\, became popular when it was recorded by The Beatles in 1963.  The original recorded versions of the song ("A Taste of Honey"\, "A Taste of Honey (refrain)" and "A Taste of Honey (closing theme)" appeared on Bobby Scott's 1960 album\, also titled A Taste of Honey\, on Atlantic Records (Atlantic 1355). After being used in the film\, the composition won Best Instrumental Theme at the Grammy Awards of 1962.  Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass recorded the most popular instrumental version of this song with a cover on their 1965 album\, Whipped Cream & Other Delights. This recording spent five weeks at #1 on the adult contemporary chart\, reached #7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart\, and won three awards including Record of the Year at the Grammy Awards of 1966.  Martin Denny and The Victor Feldman Quartet each scored minor hits in 1962 with their covers.  Acker Bilk released a version in the UK in January 1963\, reaching #16 in the UK Singles Chart.  Paul Desmond recorded it on his album Glad to be Unhappy in 1963.  Lenny Welch recorded the first vocal version. It was released as a single in September 1962 on the Cadence label and included on his 1963 album Since I Fell for You. This version also credits Lee Morris as a writer but it is not known if it was he who provided the lyrics. This credit does not appear on any covers of the song\, with only Marlow/Scott credited.  Allan Sherman recorded a parody version called "A Waste of Money".   In other news\, I have added the lyrics to this song so you can sing along\, or perhaps learn the song! This is how I learned my first Beatles song! Enjoy! :)  Album: Introducing The Beatles Recorded: February 11\, 1963	1

COL title VAL 'Deed I Do COL performer VAL Barrett Deems and the Hottet	COL video title VAL Ladi Geisler - Java COL channel name VAL Socratess2007 COL description VAL It was a huge instrumental hit for trumpet player Al Hirt back in 1964\, this Allen Toussaint's "Java".  Toussaint wrote the tune in 1958 for an album that would be released by RCA and Toussaint's studio recording did quite well in the easy listening charts.  But Al Hirt's trumpet version did even better : it was on the no1 position (easy listening) for several weeks.  Hirt also won a Grammy Award in the category "Best instrumentalist or orchestra".  Here Bert Kaempfert's "knack bass specialist" Ladi Geisler brings us his guitar version and\, even if  the arrangement stays quite close to the original one\, the mere fact of using a guitar to play the lead theme works remarkably refreshing. From his 2002 album "Those were the days" here is Ladi Geisler with "Java".  Enjoy !	0

COL title VAL In a Sentimental Mood COL performer VAL Delicatessen	COL video title VAL BILLY VAUGHN CD Vintage Dance Orchestra. Volare \, Never On Sunday\, Old Cape Cod COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL Richard "Billy Vaughn" (el 12 de abril de 1919 - el 26 de septiembre de 1991) era un cantante\, multiinstrumentista\, y líder de orquesta. Él nació en Glasgow\, Kentucky\, donde su padre era un barbero que amó la música e inspiró a Billy y le enseñó  tocar la mandolina a la edad de 3 años cuando padecía  un caso de la sarampión. Él continuó aprendiendo varios otros instrumentos.  En 1941 Vaughn se afilió a la Guardia Nacional de los Estados Unidos para lo que había sido preparado como una cesión de un año\, pero cuando la Segunda Guerra Mundial estalló\, le enviaron al extranjero hasta el final la guerra  en 1945.  Él decidió hacer de la música su carrera cuando él fue licenciado del ejército al final de guerra\, y asistió al Colegio de Estado de Kentucky Occidental\, ahora conocido como la Universidad de Kentucky Occidental.  Mientras él estaba un estudiante allí\, otros tres compañeros\, Jimmy Sacca\, Donald McGuire\, y Seymour Spiegelman\, que habían formado un trío vocal\, el Hilltoppers\, reclutaron a Vaughn para tocar el piano con ellos. Él pronto añadió su voz \, convirtiendo el trío en un cuarteto. Como  miembro del grupo\, él también escribió su primera canción \, Tentativa\, que charted en 1952.  En 1954 dejó el grupo para afiliarse a Archivos de Punto en Gallatin\, Tennessee como el director de música. Posteriormente formó su propia orquesta\, y tuvo un gran éxito en aquel mismo año "con la Melodía del Amor." Continuó cosechando éxitos  durante la próxima década y media. Vaughn murió del cáncer en Palomar\, California el 26 de septiembre\, { El 26 de septiembre} 1991.

Quand il me prend dans ses bras\, Qu'il me parle tout bas\, Je vois la vie en rose; Il me dit des mots d'amour\, Des mots de tous les jours\, Et ça m' fait quelque chose. Il est entré dans mon coeur\, Une part de bonheur Dont je connais la cause\, C'est lui pour moi\, moi pour lui dans la vie; Il me l'a dit\, l'a juré pour la vie; Et dès que je l'aperçois\, Alors je sens en moi Mon coeur qui bat.  Des nuits d'amour à plus finir\, Un grand bonheur qui prend sa place\, Les ennuis\, les chagrins trépassent... Heureux\, heureux à en mourir!	1

COL title VAL Baby\, It's Cold Outside COL performer VAL Jaymay	COL video title VAL Tony Mottola - Something stupid COL channel name VAL Socratess2007 COL description VAL Tony Mottola probably was the best studio guitar player that could be found\, after the second world war.  A fixed value in many bands and orchestras (eg that of Enoch Light) he also recorded quite a number of solo albums and many of them were quite successful.  Here he and his fellow musicians play that famous "father-daughter" song "Something stupid" (we're talking about Frank and Nancy Sinatra of course) but this arrangement transforms the song from a romantic ballad into a lighthearted and even happy tune. The way in which a melody is arranged\, can really alter the mood that is being created with the listener.  This definitely is a good example of such a rather "intense" arrangement adjustment.  From the 1967 album "Lush\, latin and lovely" here's Tony Mottola with a remarkable version of "Somethin' stupid" Enjoy !	0

COL title VAL Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea COL performer VAL Woody Herman	COL video title VAL ELIO PACE - You Never Can Tell (from the album 'Come And Get It' 2002) 4 of 16 COL channel name VAL rosarecordsonline COL description VAL 'You Never Can Tell' was written and originally recorded by Chuck Berry.  _________________________  A message from Elio...  The original concept behind 'Come And Get It'\, was to produce a high quality demo for me and my band to use as promotion with a view to attracting bigger and better corporate work as a 'covers band'. It was never intended for commercial release. Proving this point\, the original two-thousand CDs pressed in February 2002\, had no barcode on the artwork.  In fact\, the idea (going into the first day of recording) was to record only segments of 10 or 12 songs and to create a five-minute showreel. It was only just as recording was about to commence that Darren Loveday (one of two guitarists in the band at the time and my co-producer on the project) suggested that for the time it took to decide which segment of each song should be recorded\, we may as well play the whole song from start to finish\, especially as we all knew the songs so well\, having played them so many times. It was only when listening back the following day to the 13-tracks we'd recorded\, that Darren and I decided to create a full album of the material.  It was also decided that along with the 13 'new' songs\, we should make use of the 74-minutes available on CD (at the time) and include; a previous demo we'd made in 1998 of Billy Joel's 'My Life'; a live stereo recording (off MiniDisc\, with a few overdubs) of Jerry Lee Lewis' 'Great Balls Of Fire' from August 2000; and demos of three original songs I'd written (Addicted To The Phone\, Got The Bug Back and Katy Likes House) which would eventually be re-recorded and released on my 2009 'debut' album\, 'A Seat At My Table.  The last item that we decided to include on this original 19-track album was a 1998 demo we had recorded of Delbert McClinton's 'Two More Bottles Of Wine'. Ironically\, it was THIS little track (with just myself on piano\, Darren on guitar and the both of us doing the backing vocals and hand-claps) that realised the original concept for this album and opened a huge door for me in my career. Sir Terry Wogan and the late Paul Walters\, working together on BBC Radio 2's 'Wake Up To Wogan'\, played my version of 'Two More Bottles Of Wine' on their show\, once a week for six-months\, from August 2003. It was the first time that one of my recordings had been played on national radio in the UK. I really wasn't prepared for it as I didn't even have a website at the time.  I eventually got my act together and although casually stocked in a hand-full of small record shops\, 'Come And Get It' (on my own label\, Rosa Records) became available to buy in 2005 on CD via my website and then released to the general public as a download in 2007. This digital release and the subsequent CD pressings does not include the three demos of my songs... for obvious reasons. Now discontinued\, you would have to hunt down one of the original batch of those two-thousand CDs pressed in February 2002.  By the way\, the billing as 'The Elio Pace Band' was purely to guarantee that prospective clients knew that they were not booking just an individual at a piano and to differentiate between my two 'hats' as a performer; a) playing 'dance party' covers and b) playing my own material\, for which I would simply be known as Elio Pace. Interestingly\, Terry Wogan never once announced my record as 'The Elio Pace Band'. Instead he always referred to me as "Elio Pace and his band". 'Come And Get It' was the first and only album that will have 'The Elio Pace Band' as the artist name although I fully expect to record another album of covers sometime in the future.  _________________________  Track listing:  1.

COL title VAL Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas COL performer VAL Amy Grant	COL video title VAL The Carpenters - Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas (A&M Records 1978) COL channel name VAL ChristmasTimeTV COL description VAL "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" is a song introduced by Judy Garland in the 1944 MGM musical Meet Me in St. Louis. Frank Sinatra later recorded a version with modified lyrics\, which has become more common than the original. The song was written by Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane.  When presented with the original draft lyric\, Garland\, her co-star Tom Drake and director Vincente Minnelli criticized the song as depressing\, and asked Martin to change the lyrics. Though he initially resisted\, Martin made several changes to make the song more upbeat. For example\, the lines "It may be your last / Next year we may all be living in the past" became "Let your heart be light / Next year all our troubles will be out of sight". Garland's version of the song\, which was also released as a single by Decca Records\, became popular among United States troops serving in World War II; her performance at the Hollywood Canteen brought many soldiers to tears.  In 1957\, Frank Sinatra asked Martin to revise the line "Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow". He told Martin\, "The name of my album is A Jolly Christmas. Do you think you could jolly up that line for me?" Martin's new line was "Hang a shining star upon the highest bough". Martin made several other alterations\, changing the song's focus to a celebration of present happiness\, rather than anticipation of a better future. On The Judy Garland Show Christmas Special\, Judy sings the song to her children Joey and Lorna Luft with Sinatra's alternate lyrics.  Have yourself a merry little Christmas  Let your heart be light  From now on  our troubles will be out of sight  Have yourself a merry little Christmas  Make the Yule-tide gay  From now on  our troubles will be miles away   Here were are as in olden days  happy golden days of yore  Faithful friends who are dear to us  gather near to us once more   Through the years we all will be together  If the Fates allow  Hang a shining star upon the highest bough  And have yourself a merry little Christmas now	1

COL title VAL Green Onions COL performer VAL Milt Buckner	COL video title VAL That's All By Mel Torme COL channel name VAL texpaco COL description VAL Mel Tormé was an American musician and singer best known for his classic jazz vocals.  He was also a jazz composer and arranger\, a drummer\, an actor in radio\, film\, and television\, and the author of five books.  He co-wrote the classic holiday song "The Christmas Song" ("Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire") with Bob Wells.  In 1944 he formed the vocal quintet "Mel Tormé and His Mel-Tones"\, modeled on Frank Sinatra and The Pied Pipers.  His appearance in the 1947 film musical "Good News" made him a teen idol for several years.  His 1949 composition "California Suite" became Capitol Records' first 12-inch LP album.  His recording of "Careless Hands" was his only #1 hit\, although "Again" and "Blue Moon" became his signature tunes.  His singing at New York's Copacabana led a local disc jockey to give him the nickname "The Velvet Fog".  His last hit was the 1962 R&B song "Comin' Home\, Baby" which reached #36 on the pop chart.  In February 1999\, Tormé was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.  This selection is the title song from his album "That's All" released in 1965.	0

COL title VAL Hey Joe COL performer VAL Paul Gilbert	COL video title VAL 99 Red Balloons Parody - 99 Dead Baboons COL channel name VAL Axel Noble COL description VAL Someone requesting for the lyrics\, So\, here is it. =) Let's now sing this song all together! Wew!   Hey\, have a lot of you heard the new song by Nena - "99 Red Balloons"? You know\, I heard the German version of that song first\, and I really liked it. But then I heard the English version\, and I was really surprised to find that what she's singing in English and what she's singing in German are not even close. Uh\, I ended up buying the record\, and I listened very closely to the German version\, and I've come up with a new English translation that I think is really much more accurate\, much closer... I have to admit there are a couple of lines in this new English version that I'm not real sure about\, but I think it's a much more accurate version. Now this is the new version\, "99 Red Balloons".  Hello Bobby my old friend. It's good to see you once again. How's your mother\, how's your aunt? How's your father's skin diving suit? (That's one of the lines I'm not real sure about\, but it goes something like this.)  I've got something you should see Back at my place; come with me. I've got some brand new furnishings\, Plus 99 dead baboons  99 dead baboons Sitting in my living room. Not too functional it seems\, But quite a conversation piece. This one's Jake\, that one's Dinah\, There's big Ned in my recliner. No it's not a lazy boy. Can't you see it's a dead baboon?  Dead baboons\, dead baboons. Dead baboons\, dead baboons.  How they got here I'm not sure; Woke up one day\, there they were. Luckily I've got a lease Allowing pets if they're deceased. I'm just thankful they're not apes\, 'Cuz apes would clash with the drapes. No more napkins at my parties - Wipe your hands on a dead baboon.  Dead baboons\, dead baboons. Dead baboons\, dead baboons.  Dead baboons are lots of fun; Playin' water balloons I've always won. You can keep your dead giraffes and swine\, I'll take dead baboons every time. There's just one problem I have found: It's finding Purina Dead Baboon Chow. But what a happy snorkelling device... (That's another line I'm not real sure about\, but it's somethin' like that) With 99 dead baboons.  Dead baboons\, dead baboons. Dead baboons\, dead baboons.	0

GET HERE Music and Lyrics\, Brenda Russell  You can reach me by railway\, you can reach me by trailway You can reach me on an airplane\, you can reach me with your mind You can reach me by caravan\, cross the desert like an Arab man I don't care how you get here\, just- get here if you can  You can reach me by sailboat\, climb a tree and swing rope to rope Take a sled and slide down slow\, into these arms of mine You can jump on a speedy colt\, cross the border in a blaze of hope I don't care how you get here\, just- get here if you can  There are hills and mountains between us Always something to get over If I had my way\, then surely you would be closer I need you closer  You can windsurf into my life\, take me up on a carpet ride You can make it in a big balloon\, but you better make it soon You can reach me by caravan\, cross the desert like an Arab man I don't care how you get here\, just- get here if you can  I don't care\, I dont care\, I need you right here right now I need you right here\, right now\, right by my side I don't care how you get here\, just- get here if you can.  "Get Here" is a pop ballad written by American singer/songwriter Brenda Russell which became an international hit via a 1990 recording by Oleta Adams\, reaching #4 in the UK and #5 (#8 R&B) in the US.  Brenda Russell had written the song while staying at a penthouse in Stockholm: the tune came to her as she viewed some hot air balloons floating over the city\, a sight Russell recalls set her "really tripping on how many ways you can get to a person" (the eventual song's lyrics include the line: "You can make it in a big balloon but you'd better make it soon"). Although Russell did not pursue the musical ideas that came to her as her current record label saw her as a dance artist and she thought would not be interested in a song such as the one which became "Get Here"\, the song was still in the singer's mind when she woke up the next day: "I don't read or write music [therefore] it's extraordinary if a song is still in my head that I haven't jotted down or recorded. So if it's still in my head overnight\, I think that's something extra special\, it's like somebody trying to tell me something." Russell recorded the song as the title cut of her 1988 album from which it was issued as a single - the album's third - reaching the Top 40 on the Billboard R&B charts.  It was while Oleta Adams was visiting Stockholm that she heard the original Brenda Russell version of "Get Here" playing in a record store and was sufficiently impressed with the song to record it for her 1990 debut album Circle of One. Adams' "Get Here" was issued as a single - after two previous tracks from Circle of One had been released to scant notice - in November 1990; world events at this time gave the song a resonance as an anthem for the US troops in the Gulf War - underscored by the lyrics: "You can reach me by caravan|Cross the desert like an Arab man" - which impelled Adams' single into the Top Ten of the Billboard Hot 100 in the spring of 1991 .  A signature number of Justin Guarini during season #1 of American Idol and included on the Justin Guarini album\, "Get Here" has also been recorded by Vanessa Amorosi\, Paul Anka\, David Archuleta\, Alexia Gardner\, Barbara Mandrell\, Omar Chakil (who wrote French lyrics for his version: "Tu m'as tout donné ")\, Q featuring Tracey Ackerman\, Jennifer Rush\, Livingston Taylor and Jonalyn Viray. A humorous cover\, which featured comedy sound effects after each method of transport mentioned\, was performed by fictional singer Michelle Coffee in the Peter Kay series Phoenix Nights.  The Beautiful South's album Gaze included a song with the same title and\, partially\, similar lyrics - but reversed the theme\, with Paul Heaton protesting his unwillingness to travel any distance at all for his lover. (Sample lyric: "You can get here by helicopter"/"I can barely make Blackpool sands").

COL title VAL Misirlou COL performer VAL The Challengers	COL video title VAL The Carpenters - Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas (A&M Records 1978) COL channel name VAL ChristmasTimeTV COL description VAL "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" is a song introduced by Judy Garland in the 1944 MGM musical Meet Me in St. Louis. Frank Sinatra later recorded a version with modified lyrics\, which has become more common than the original. The song was written by Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane.  When presented with the original draft lyric\, Garland\, her co-star Tom Drake and director Vincente Minnelli criticized the song as depressing\, and asked Martin to change the lyrics. Though he initially resisted\, Martin made several changes to make the song more upbeat. For example\, the lines "It may be your last / Next year we may all be living in the past" became "Let your heart be light / Next year all our troubles will be out of sight". Garland's version of the song\, which was also released as a single by Decca Records\, became popular among United States troops serving in World War II; her performance at the Hollywood Canteen brought many soldiers to tears.  In 1957\, Frank Sinatra asked Martin to revise the line "Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow". He told Martin\, "The name of my album is A Jolly Christmas. Do you think you could jolly up that line for me?" Martin's new line was "Hang a shining star upon the highest bough". Martin made several other alterations\, changing the song's focus to a celebration of present happiness\, rather than anticipation of a better future. On The Judy Garland Show Christmas Special\, Judy sings the song to her children Joey and Lorna Luft with Sinatra's alternate lyrics.  Have yourself a merry little Christmas  Let your heart be light  From now on  our troubles will be out of sight  Have yourself a merry little Christmas  Make the Yule-tide gay  From now on  our troubles will be miles away   Here were are as in olden days  happy golden days of yore  Faithful friends who are dear to us  gather near to us once more   Through the years we all will be together  If the Fates allow  Hang a shining star upon the highest bough  And have yourself a merry little Christmas now	0

Although he was Jewish\, he specialized in Christmas songs and wrote many standards including "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\," "I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day\," "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\, and "Run Rudolph Run."  This song was first recorded by the Quinto Sisters and later by Burl Ives.  The guitarist is Harold Ray Bradley\, the brother of the musical director Owen Bradley.  Burl Icle Ivanhoe Ives (June 14\, 1909 – April 14\, 1995) was an American singer and actor of stage\, screen\, radio and television.  He began as an itinerant singer and banjoist\, and launched his own radio show\, The Wayfaring Stranger\, which popularized traditional folk songs. In 1942 he appeared in Irving Berlin's This Is the Army\, and then became a major star of CBS radio. In the 1960s he successfully crossed over into country music\, recording hits such as "A Little Bitty Tear" and "Funny Way of Laughing". A popular film actor through the late 1940s and 1950s\, Ives's best-known roles in that medium included parts in So Dear to My Heart and Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\, as well as Rufus Hannassey in The Big Country\, for which he won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.  Ives is often remembered for his starring role in the 1964 Christmas stop-motion television special Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\, which continues to air on CBS every Christmas season\, as the voice of "Sam the Snowman"\, the special's host and narrator.  Have a holly\, jolly Christmas;  It's the best time of the year  I don't know if there'll be snow  but have a cup of cheer  Have a holly\, jolly Christmas;  And when you walk down the street  Say Hello to friends you know  and everyone you meet   Oh ho  the mistletoe  hung where you can see;  Somebody waits for you;  Kiss her once for me  Have a holly jolly Christmas  and in case you didn't hear  Oh by golly  have a holly  jolly Christmas this year	0

"I've seldom heard recordings that were so successful in both performance and sound aspects.'' quotes from Rad Bennett's review in the audiophile SoundStage! Magazine. Check out Carmen's new audiophile Studio Master Download  from the Sound Liaison label'.http://www.soundliaison.com/ Format: 24-bit/96kHz WAW(download) I've been among the prophets saying that high-resolution downloads are the future of audiophile music sales. Surely it will benefit the majors to make high-quality downloads a first choice rather than an MP3 extra\, but I believe that individual artists can benefit as well. Most new-to-the-scene performers have little money for middlemen and disc manufacture\, yet can get things together for the Internet.  Frans de Rond and Peter Bjørnild have taken this approach with Sound Liaison\, producing recordings available only in 24-bit/96kHz downloads that mirror the master recording. And man\, are they ever sweet. I've seldom heard recordings that were so successful in both performance and sound aspects.  De Rond hails from the Netherlands\, where he studied double bass at The Royal Conservatory in The Hague while concurrently studying recording techniques. Bjørnild also studied double bass\, moving to the Netherlands to continue studies at The Hague. Since graduating\, he has played almost every type of music\, from classical to jazz. Together de Rond and Bjørnild bring two pairs of golden ears to their label. Bjørnild claims that\, "a recording should be as realistic and beautiful sounding as possible. As if\, when closing your eyes\, you find yourself in the best seat in the hall."  The partners discovered a fine recording hall (Studio-Eleven\, Hilversum) and set out to record amazing musicians in this great acoustic place in front of live audiences. It's a daring feat; one take and no place to hide\, but the abilities of the musicians involved make it seem easy. I chose to talk about the first album by Carmen Gomes Inc. It was a tough choice because all of the three current albums were worthy of review.  Carmen Gomes has won many awards in the Netherlands and surrounding areas. Like so many new European singers\, she sings in English -- excellent English\, I might add. She's formed a group called Carmen Gomes Inc.\, with Folker Tettero on guitar\, Peter Bjørnild on double bass\, and Marcel van Engelen on drums. Her style is bluesy and intimate with a sexy voice that's sweet as dark tupelo honey\, and her interpretations are unerring. The musicians play to her and to each other\, and the ensemble is so tight that the four musicians breathe and move as one.  There are some standards on the set that knocked me over with their fresh approach. Any singer can misplace a few accents and rhythms and come up with something that's original\, but perhaps also uneasy and a little strange. Not Gomes\, who has taken the songs to their bones and then restructured them to suit her style. Thus "Fever" doesn't sound like a cover of Peggy Lee; it sounds like a brand new take on a familiar song. You emerge from hearing it not thinking it's better or lesser than Lee's version\, but that it's a valid new interpretation that could have come first.  The same approach works on "Angel Eyes\," "You Don't Know What Love Is\," and "I'm on Fire." Most of the rest\, including the title song\, "Oblivion\," "Time Will Tell\," "Gasoa Blue\," and "The Sea\," are Gomes originals that fit right in with the standards. The recording achieves exactly what Bjørnild set out as his goal. It can provide the best seat in your listening room. Go to the Sound Liaison site\, listen to a few samples\, download an album\, and see if you don't agree that this intimate effort is one of the best and best-sounding jazz vocal albums to come along in many a day. By the way\, the small audience applauds enthusiastically enough after the last chords of a song die away\, but the attendees never interrupt or make themselves known while a song is going on. No doubt they were completely mesmerized into silence\, as was I.  Be sure to listen to: On "Dock of the Bay\," Gomes creates a languid\, bluesy version that is a little bit reminiscent of Bobbie Gentry while still coming across as quite original. It'll cast a spell over you.  . . . Rad Bennett radb@soundstagenetwork.comradb@soundstagenetwork.com	0

COL title VAL Misirlou COL performer VAL The Challengers	COL video title VAL 99 Red Balloons Parody - 99 Dead Baboons COL channel name VAL Axel Noble COL description VAL Someone requesting for the lyrics\, So\, here is it. =) Let's now sing this song all together! Wew!   Hey\, have a lot of you heard the new song by Nena - "99 Red Balloons"? You know\, I heard the German version of that song first\, and I really liked it. But then I heard the English version\, and I was really surprised to find that what she's singing in English and what she's singing in German are not even close. Uh\, I ended up buying the record\, and I listened very closely to the German version\, and I've come up with a new English translation that I think is really much more accurate\, much closer... I have to admit there are a couple of lines in this new English version that I'm not real sure about\, but I think it's a much more accurate version. Now this is the new version\, "99 Red Balloons".  Hello Bobby my old friend. It's good to see you once again. How's your mother\, how's your aunt? How's your father's skin diving suit? (That's one of the lines I'm not real sure about\, but it goes something like this.)  I've got something you should see Back at my place; come with me. I've got some brand new furnishings\, Plus 99 dead baboons  99 dead baboons Sitting in my living room. Not too functional it seems\, But quite a conversation piece. This one's Jake\, that one's Dinah\, There's big Ned in my recliner. No it's not a lazy boy. Can't you see it's a dead baboon?  Dead baboons\, dead baboons. Dead baboons\, dead baboons.  How they got here I'm not sure; Woke up one day\, there they were. Luckily I've got a lease Allowing pets if they're deceased. I'm just thankful they're not apes\, 'Cuz apes would clash with the drapes. No more napkins at my parties - Wipe your hands on a dead baboon.  Dead baboons\, dead baboons. Dead baboons\, dead baboons.  Dead baboons are lots of fun; Playin' water balloons I've always won. You can keep your dead giraffes and swine\, I'll take dead baboons every time. There's just one problem I have found: It's finding Purina Dead Baboon Chow. But what a happy snorkelling device... (That's another line I'm not real sure about\, but it's somethin' like that) With 99 dead baboons.  Dead baboons\, dead baboons. Dead baboons\, dead baboons.	0

COL title VAL Memories of You COL performer VAL Thelonious Monk	COL video title VAL Mildred Bailey - I Don't Stand A Ghost Of A Chance With You - 1939 COL channel name VAL warholsoup100 COL description VAL Vintage Radio Slideshow. Mildred Bailey (February 27\, 1907 -- December 12\, 1951) was a popular and influential American jazz singer during the 1930s\, known as "The Rockin' Chair Lady" and "Mrs. Swing". Her number one hits were "Please Be Kind"\, "Darn That Dream"\, "Rockin' Chair" and "Says My Heart". In the mid 1930s\, she recorded with her third husband Red Norvo. A dynamic couple\, they earned the nicknames "Mr. and Mrs. Swing". During this period (1936--1939) Norvo recorded for Brunswick (with Bailey as primary vocalist) and Bailey recorded her own set of recordings for Vocalion\, often with Norvo's band. Some of her recordings instead featured members of Count Basie's band. Despite her divorce from Norvo\, she and Red would continue to record together until 1945. Suffering from diabetes and depression (during her adult life Bailey was overweight)\, she only made a few recordings following World War II.  Mildred Bailey died December 12\, 1951\, in Poughkeepsie\, New York\, of heart failure\, aged 44\, chiefly due to her diabetes. Her ashes were scattered. Red Norvo outlived Bailey by nearly half a century\, dying in April 1999\, a week after his 91st birthday. "I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You" is a 1932 song composed by Victor Young\, with lyrics written by Ned Washington and Bing Crosby\, recorded on October 14\, 1932 by Bing Crosby in New York. In 1939\, Mildred Bailey fronted a six-side\, mostly blues session as "Mildred Bailey and her Oxford Greys" for Vocalion\, which featured a small mixed-race combo of Mary Lou Williams (piano)\, Floyd Smith (electric guitar)\, John Williams (bass) and Eddie Dougherty (drums).	0
COL title VAL The Varsity Drag COL performer VAL Sam Lanin and His Orchestra	COL video title VAL Mike Bloomfield's Electric Flag with Erma Franklin - Big Boss Man COL channel name VAL Erwin Boermans COL description VAL Live at the Carousel Ballroom\, 21th of April 1968  Erma Franklin - vocals Mike Bloomfield - lead guitar Terry Clements - tenor sax Virgil Gonsalves - baritone sax\, flute Stemsy Hunter - alto sax Marcus Doubleday - trumpet Herbie Rich - organ (possibly some baritone sax on 5) Harvey Brooks - bass Nick Gravenites - lead vocals  Erma Franklin is sister to the well-known Aretha. Erma’s career for Shout! Records resulted in several single releases in 1967 including Big Boss Man  This recording was made when Erma took the stage at the Carousel Ballroom in San Francisco for three nights in April from the 19th to the 21st in 1968. Backing her was Mike Bloomfield’s Electric Flag\, a blues rock group. Much of the research done in identifying the date\, venue and personnel was by Dave M of the westcoastacidandpsychedelia Yahoo group. Says Dave: “The week before at the Carousel (April 14\, 1968)\, there had been an unscheduled Sunday show and jam session featuring Quicksilver Messenger Service and numerous other musicians. The tape circulates\, and since Gary Duncan jokes about Easter Sunday\, it makes it easy to reliably date the show. All this points to another Sunday jam session\, so if I had to guess I would pick Sunday\, April 21 for the date of this show. Anyway\, that’s my story and I’m sticking to it.”	0

COL title VAL While We're Young COL performer VAL Jackie Ryan	COL video title VAL George E. Lee's Novelty Singing Orch. - St James Infirmary COL channel name VAL 240252 COL description VAL From Wikipedia:  St James Infirmary -- American folksong\, made famous by Louis Armstrong recording from 1928. (Many records credit it to Joe Primrose\, which is a pseudonim of Irving Mills - agent and songwriter\, probably an autor of an original arrangement).  George E. Lee Singing Novelty Orchestra steadily grew in number and sophistication throughout all the 1920s. George and his sister Julia's showmanship and strong vocals made the band a hit with the audiences in the 18th and Vine area. In August\, 1923\, the six-piece Lee band recorded for the OKeh label\, becoming the first African American band from Kansas City to record. Unfortunately\, Okeh judged the result of the session unsatisfactory and declined to release the two selections\, "Just Wait Until I'm gone" and "Waco Blues." Having missed an opportunity for national exposure\, the Lee band continued playing the dance halls and cabarets in the 18th and Vine community.  In November\, 1929\, the Lee band recorded six selections for the Brunswick label\, including "St James Infirmary." Louis Armstrong had recorded an up-tempo version of "Saint James Infirmary" a year earlier\, but it failed to catch on with the record-buying public. Lee's slower-tempo version better matched the solemn lyrics describing a gambler meditating on his own mortality while viewing his dead sweetheart's body in Saint James Infirmary. The record sold well locally\, but Brunswick did not promote it nationally in the advent of the Great Depression. Cab Calloway's cover of Lee's version of "Saint James Infirmary\," recorded the next year\, created a national sensation.    Recording: George E. Lee & His Novelty Singing Orch.\, voc. George E.

Now more than half a century old\, the Henry Mancini classic penned for the Audrey Hepburn movie 'Breakfast at Tiffanys'\, is in truly safe hands with Ms Reader.

She didn`t know him personally\, but his influence on the Greenwich Village scene was so immeasurbly profound that it`s no wonder she discovered his songs.

Es que desde hace mucho tiempo solo teníamos de este grupo una pequeña foto borrosa y una reseña en inglés que subió George Bonilla al sitio http://www.incarock.com. Yo nunca los había escuchado.  En 1964\, Diego García Sayán\, los hermanos José y Freddy Rizo Patrón\, Ramón Orbegoso y Felipe Larrabure\, formaron Los Hang Tens (1964-1968). Ellos eran compañeros de estudios del colegio Santa María en el distrito San Isidro. "Una banda que se formó sin la pretensión de convertirse en grupo profesional\, pues el principal propósito era reunirse para disfrutar de la música y entretener a sus amigos en fiestas y funciones escolares"\, dice Bonilla. Según esta misma referencia\, ellos (como ya muchos en el mundo) habían caído bajo el influjo de la llamada "invasión británica": Beatles\, Rolling Stones\, Kinks\, Yarbirds\, Dave Clark Five\, Animals\, Herman Hermits\, etc. También participaron en el grupo Manuel Sanguinetti\, Juan de Aliaga\, Jaime Sabal y Guillermo Pérez Argüello\, remplazando o alternándose con los fundadores. La popularidad del grupo atrajo la atención del sello Odeon\, que les propuso grabar un 45 rpm\, que ahora se ha convertido en pieza de colección: "Till the end of the day" (del grupo The Kinks) en el lado A y "These boots were made for walking" (que popularizara Nancy Sinatra) en el lado B. El disco salió en 1966. En 1967\, los hermanos Rizo Patrón y Manuel Sanguinetti ya planeaban crear un grupo de mayores proyecciones: Traffic Sound. Pero esa ya es otra historia (y qué historia).	0

De la mano de Mitch Miller\, director artístico de la casa Columbia\, aplicó el inexorable principio de que\, cuantos peores eran los arreglos y las letras de los temas\, mas beneficio económico para la discográfica. onsiguió grabar un par de duets con Frank Sinatra en 1950 y a partir de ahí le sobrevino la fama y la popularidad. Tuvo su propio show televisivo e incluso Hollywood llamó a su puerta para que participara junto a Bing Crosby y Danny Kaye en algunas comedias musicales siendo la mas celebre el film de Michael Curtiz\, "White Christmas".No obstante lo dicho\, Rosemary Clooney\, se acercó tardíamente al jazz y grabó una par de magníficos álbumes para Columbia: "The Best Of Hollywood" con la orquesta del trompetista\, Harry James\, y "Blue Rose"\, su obra mas conseguida y un disco que pudo ser memorable con la orquesta de Duke Ellington. Es la tía sanguínea del actual actor George Clooney.

It was originally recorded by Toni Arden for the 1951 film Royal Wedding.  Nancy Sue Wilson (February 20\, 1937 – December 13\, 2018) was an American singer whose career spanned over five decades\, from the mid–1950s until her retirement in the early–2010s. She was notable for her single "(You Don't Know) How Glad I Am" and her version of the standard "Guess Who I Saw Today".  On December 13\, 2018\, Wilson died at her home in Pioneertown\, California after a long illness. She was 81 years old.  Nancy's accompanied by Billy May & His Orchestra.  (Capitol Records)  All the things we've done together Are really when we're apart All the tender fun together Stays on in my heart  Too late now to forget your smile  The way we cling when we danced awhile  Too late now to forget and go on to someone new   Too late now to forget your voice  The way one word makes my heart rejoice  Too late now to imagine myself away from you   All the things we've done together  I relive when we're apart  All the tender fun together  Stays on in my heart   How could I ever close the door  And be the same as I was before?  Darling\, no\, no I can't anymore  It's too late now   All the things we have done together  I relive when we're apart  All the tender fun together  Stays on in my heart   How could I ever close the door  And be the same as I was before?

Available in physical form direct from website http://HistoryofRnB.net   Download from   Amazon http://www.amazon.co.uk/Those-Hoodlum-Friends-Coasters-Stereo/dp/B00BR0QU6A/ref=dm_cd_album_lnk  iTunes https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/those-hoodlum-friends-coasters/id609884465    Stream from Spotify http://open.spotify.com/album/6IDmQkLUjCQe6poBO4izrg   The Coasters had the benefit of recording in the best studios\, backed by the best musicians and produced by the top producers of their generation\, Leiber and Stoller. Naturally\, they were required to run through as many takes of each song as was necessary to satisfy the exacting demands of their mentors. Luckily for us\, many of these alternate takes have survived. Mono was the standard recording format until the late 1960s\, but many of the big selling artists also recorded alternate versions specifically for the stereo market\, which was targeted to the discerning adult listener.     Disc One features all the alternate stereo versions of Coasters songs that were issued at the time on album and subsequently on CD. Disc Two takes you deep into the heart of Coasters sessions with composite tracks which combine studio chatter together with the finest moments from various different takes. This disc contains several outtakes which have until now been unavailable anywhere and gives an invaluable insight into the genesis of many well-loved tracks and also into the character and working practice of the Coasters and of their producers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller.

COL title VAL Think of One COL performer VAL Robert Glasper Trio	COL video title VAL California Ramblers Wally Edwards Orch. - Peanut Vendor 1930 El Manisero COL channel name VAL warholsoup100 COL description VAL Peanut vendor 12-2-1930. 1930 California Ramblers. Columbia 2351 Columbia DC104. First recording of this song by a U.S. group. Yes\, it's the Ramblers\, not the usual sound you might think. The California Ramblers were a popular and prolific jazz group from the 1920s\, that recorded hundreds of songs under many different record labels throughout the 1920s. Three of the members of the band\, Red Nichols\, Jimmy Dorsey\, and Tommy Dorsey\, would go on to front big bands in later decades. The original bandmembers were from Ohio\, but chose the name California Ramblers because they thought people would be less inclined to listen to a jazz band from the Midwest. The Peanut Vendor (original title: El Manisero) is a Cuban song based on a street-seller's cry\, and known as a pregón. It is possibly the most famous piece of music created by a Cuban musician. The Peanut Vendor has been recorded more than 160 times\, sold over a million copies of the sheet music\, and was the first million-selling 78rpm of Cuban music.	0

COL title VAL Across the Universe COL performer VAL Sweet Little Band	COL video title VAL Perez Prado - Guaglione (1958) COL channel name VAL Moraito COL description VAL Perez Prado (1958) Guaglione is a Neapolitan song with music by Giuseppe Fanciulli and words by Nicola "Nisa" Salerno. It was the winning song at the IV Napoli Song Festival broadcast by radio in 1956. The song's title means simply "boy" in Neapolitan language but as slang translates to "street bum"\, "urchin"\, "back street boy"\, "corner boy" or "street tough". The word guaglione has appeared as "wallyo" in New York immigrant slang. The song has been covered by various artists\, including Italian bandleader Renzo Arbore\, and Italian singers Claudio Villa\, Aurelio Fierro and Renato Carosone. Under the title "The Man Who Plays the Mandolino"\, with a lyric in English\, Dean Martin sang it in 1956 after Fred Raphael of Walt Disney Music Company obtained for Disney the U.S. publishing rights. The best known version of "Guaglione" was recorded by the Cuban bandleader Perez Prado in 1958 as an uptempo mambo tune. As a mambo\, the track rose to fame in 1995 after it was used for the Guinness advert "Anticipation". It has since been featured as the intro music for the 1996 video game Kingdom O' Magic\, and more recently as the opening music for the television showJimmy's Farm. The song is one of Disney's biggest profit makers. Written by G. Fanciulli &\, Nisa and produced by Herman Diaz\, Jr. All music or related performances remain the sole property of their respective copyright holders.

Si François Glorieux est le seul pianiste de notre XXè siècle à s'être aventuré aussi loin dans le domaine de l'improvisation\, il ne révèle ici qu'UN des des multiples aspects de ce "grand art" qu'il pratique comme personne : l'improvisation de style. Et cela tient du miracle! Loin de se contenter d'un "pastiche à la manière de ..."\, il nous démontre comment les noms illustres de l'histoire de la musique auraient pu traiter les admirables mélodies des Beatles. Certains thèmes ont été reproduits intégralement\, d'autres ont été légèrement modifiés ou adaptés à l'image même du compositeur! Et on chercherait en vain un défaut de style ou de construction\, une faute de goût\, une lacune. Comme le disait si bien un critique musical allemand : " François Glorieux est en quelque sorte le faux-monnayeur de l'improvisation\, car c'est si parfait\, si réussi\, qu'on ne sait s'il joue le vrai ou le faux."	0

COL title VAL Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas COL performer VAL Connie Francis	COL video title VAL The Carpenters - Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas (A&M Records 1978) COL channel name VAL ChristmasTimeTV COL description VAL "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" is a song introduced by Judy Garland in the 1944 MGM musical Meet Me in St. Louis. Frank Sinatra later recorded a version with modified lyrics\, which has become more common than the original. The song was written by Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane.  When presented with the original draft lyric\, Garland\, her co-star Tom Drake and director Vincente Minnelli criticized the song as depressing\, and asked Martin to change the lyrics. Though he initially resisted\, Martin made several changes to make the song more upbeat. For example\, the lines "It may be your last / Next year we may all be living in the past" became "Let your heart be light / Next year all our troubles will be out of sight". Garland's version of the song\, which was also released as a single by Decca Records\, became popular among United States troops serving in World War II; her performance at the Hollywood Canteen brought many soldiers to tears.  In 1957\, Frank Sinatra asked Martin to revise the line "Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow". He told Martin\, "The name of my album is A Jolly Christmas. Do you think you could jolly up that line for me?" Martin's new line was "Hang a shining star upon the highest bough". Martin made several other alterations\, changing the song's focus to a celebration of present happiness\, rather than anticipation of a better future. On The Judy Garland Show Christmas Special\, Judy sings the song to her children Joey and Lorna Luft with Sinatra's alternate lyrics.  Have yourself a merry little Christmas  Let your heart be light  From now on  our troubles will be out of sight  Have yourself a merry little Christmas  Make the Yule-tide gay  From now on  our troubles will be miles away   Here were are as in olden days  happy golden days of yore  Faithful friends who are dear to us  gather near to us once more   Through the years we all will be together  If the Fates allow  Hang a shining star upon the highest bough  And have yourself a merry little Christmas now	1

Jack Norworth\, who while riding a subway train\, was inspired by a sign that said "Baseball Today — Polo Grounds". In the song\, Katie's (and later Nelly's) beau calls to ask her out to see a show. She accepts the date\, but only if her date will take her out to the ballgame. The words were set to music by Albert Von Tilzer\, (Norworth and Von Tilzer finally saw their first Major League Baseball games 32 and 20 years later\, respectively). The song was first sung by Norworth's then-wife Nora Bayes and popularized by many other vaudeville acts. It was played at a ballpark for the first known time in 1934\, at a high-school game in Los Angeles\, and researchers think it made its debut at a major-league park later that year. Norworth wrote an alternative version of the song in 1927. (Norworth and Bayes were famous for writing and performing such smash hits as "Shine On\, Harvest Moon".) With the sale of so many records\, sheet music\, and piano rolls\, the song became one of the most popular hits of 1908. The Haydn Quartet singing group\, led by popular tenor Harry MacDonough\, recorded a successful version on Victor Records. Contrary to some sources\, Billy Murray\, although a fan of baseball in general and the New York Giants in particular\, never recorded a version of the song. One of the well-known quartets\, whose sessions frequently included Murray\, did record the song\, but without Murray\, leading to some confusion in some of the record catalogues. The confusion\, nonetheless\, is so pervasive that\, when "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" was selected by the National Endowment for the Arts and the Recording Industry Association of America as one of the 365 top "Songs of the Century"\, the song was credited to Billy Murray\, implying his recording of it as having received the most votes among songs from the first decade. The first recorded version was by Edward Meeker. Meeker's recording was selected by the Library of Congress as a 2010 addition to the National Recording Registry\, which selects recordings annually that are "culturally\, historically\, or aesthetically significant". 1908 Version: Katie Casey was baseball mad\, Had the fever and had it bad. Just to root for the home town crew\, Ev'ry sou Katie blew. On a Saturday her young beau Called to see if she'd like to go To see a show\, but Miss Kate said "No\, I'll tell you what you can do:" Take me out to the ball game\, Take me out with the crowd; Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack\, I don't care if I never get back. Let me root\, root\, root for the home team\, If they don't win\, it's a shame. For it's one\, two\, three strikes\, you're out\, At the old ball game. Katie Casey saw all the games\, Knew the players by their first names. Told the umpire he was wrong\, All along\, Good and strong. When the score was just two to two\, Katie Casey knew what to do\, Just to cheer up the boys she knew\, She made the gang sing this song	0

The music was written by Vincent Rose\, the lyrics by [John L. Rooney]. It was recorded six times in 1940. Victor Records released the recording by the Sammy Kaye Orchestra with vocals by Tommy Ryan on May 31\, 1940 (catalog #26643\, with the flip side "Maybe"; matrix #51050). Gene Krupa's version was issued on the Okeh label (#5672) on June 3. Other 1940 recordings were by: Glenn Miller on Bluebird (10768)\, Kay Kyser\, Russ Morgan\, Gene Autry (also in the 1941 film The Singing Hill)\, Connee Boswell\, and Jimmy Dorsey. The largest 1940 hit was by Glenn Miller.  Louis Armstrong's 1949 recording charted in the Billboard Top 40. It was an international hit in 1956 for Fats Domino\, and has become a rock and roll standard. It reached number two\, for three weeks on the Billboard Top 40 charts\, becoming his biggest pop hit\, and spent eight non-consecutive weeks at number one on the R&B Best Sellers chart. The version by Fats Domino was also ranked #81 in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

(the first line of Domino's 1950s version of "Blueberry Hill") in reference to pretty girls he dated or wanted to date.  It is one of the songs that the time traveling James Cole enjoys in the film\, Twelve Monkeys\, and the song is later sung by the scientists upon his return to the future.  The song is purportedly named after a "make-out" spot in Taos\, New Mexico.  Joe Edwards' restaurant on the Delmar Loop in St. Louis\, Missouri\, where Chuck Berry frequently plays\, is named after the song.  The Far Side\, a comic written by Gary Larson\, features a comic parodying the lyrics of this song. A man is talking in a phone booth on top of a hill named "Blueberry Hill." He says into the phone "Norm? This is Mitch. ... You were right--I found my drill." The parody is of the line "found my thrill on Blueberry Hill."  Prime Minister of Russia Vladimir Putin made a cover performance of the song on December 10\, 2010 before an audience of international film and television celebrities\, in support of a charity for ill children. Videos of his performance quickly went viral worldwide.	0

On the Turkish side\, the campaign also cost an estimated 250\,000 casualties\, with 65\,000 killed." Source: http://www.history.com/topics/world-war-i/battle-of-gallipoli  ****Note added 25 April 2010:  When I was asked to create this presentation for a Remembrance Day assembly\, I didn't know how I would show an "anti-war" song at an event that is supposed to honour our veterans. At the same time\, war and military conflict was such a distant concept for our students\,  I wanted to some how make history relevant to them\, let alone an "Australian" song that most of the our middle school students have never heard.  The more I listened to Bogle's words\, the more I realized that this song was about more than a moment in history. It's about how history repeats itself and the great sacrifices that are made during war and how futile it all is if we fail to learn from our mistakes.  Making the transition from B/W to full colour to coincide with Bogle's words "We started all over again\," I wanted to show how war is part of our past\, present and (unfortunately) future.  Great sacrifices have been made because of war. Bogle asks "What are they marching for?" I say they are marching to honour those sacrifices. If any veteran is offended by this video\, I truly do apologize.  *************************  April 25 - ANZAC Day November 11 - Remembrance Day  "Waltzing Matilda" is a very famous Australian folk song and a "Matilda" was the name given to the pack that Australian farm workers carried on their backs.   To "Waltz Matilda" meant to carry your pack of belongings through the bush.   The song "The Band Played Waltzing Matilda" by Eric Bogle is about Australian soldiers who fought against Turkish troops and died in the Battle of Gallipoli in World War I.  Mixed with pictures from Gallipoli are pictures of past and present Canadian troops because this song and slideshow was played during a Remembrance Day assembly at a Canadian public school.  Information about this song was taken from this web page (which is NOT mine) that talks about Eric Bogle's performance of this song:   http://www.fortunecity.com/tinpan/parton/2/matilda.html  Judging by a lot of people's comments\, I should have used another source for info and double-checked the data. I hope that Bogle's message reaches beyond just numbers--because all sacrifices big or small are significant.	0

COL title VAL She Moved Thro' the Fair COL performer VAL John McDermott	COL video title VAL Marlene Dietrich  - Sag mir "Adieu" (Time On My Hands) 1950 COL channel name VAL 240252 COL description VAL Marlene Dietrich & Orch. dir. by Jimmie Carroll – Time On My Hands [Sag mir Adieu] (Music: Youmans\, German lyrics: L.Metzl) Columbia 1950 (Recorded in USA; Sung in German)   NOTE: I absolutely love Vincent Youmans and I think “Time On My Hands” along with a haunting tango “Orchids In the Moonlight” belongs to his most beautiful compositions. Performed by dozens of the most important artists of the 20th Century\, this song had also been recorded by Marlene Dietrich\, who created one of its artistically most significant interpretations. I’m glad I can present it today recorded straight from the original shellac and without any remastering done to it. Marlene’s singing paints a poignant and true scene of the farewell between the lovers and through the German lyrics\, she adds the ambiguous and somewhat mysterious beauty to her creation.	0

COL title VAL 'Round Midnight COL performer VAL Sun Ra and His Astro Infinity Arkestra	COL video title VAL Eydie Gorme   Round Midnight COL channel name VAL ifcopod COL description VAL Don't tell anyone  I'd probably prefer this Gorme  performance to any by Billie Holiday.though I have a sneaking affection for the soupy strings added by Our Man on Broadway  Ray Ellis to   Billie's two late albums. Billie was vaunted for her assimilation of  jazz instrumentalists in effect using her voice  plus vibrato  like a jazz soloist. Edyie Gorme and  husband Steve Lawrence  had stellar careers as popular song stylists backed by Don Costa  Orchestra when she recorded   in the 1950s for ABC Paramount. Their careers crossed  as well as threading  solo   paths..OK point taken Gorme is not a tragedienne as Holiday was  but then some are not overly flexed about tragedy in music. However the punch line in this   special  performance   comes  at the close of a wonderful vibrato laden styling. Edyie  underlining that singers of   this calibre just aint around  She  really  caps the proceedings with an amazingly held  smoky   closing note seems wonderfully to go on   and on  and on ~ sadly  interrupted by the  head honchos    monitoring  the recording  What a gang of philistines.. .One of the best  endings  you'll hear  from any singer  Gorme's interpretation worth it for this  alone.	1

COL title VAL 'S Wonderful COL performer VAL Johnny Smith	COL video title VAL Bettye LaVette - The Word (Amazing Beatles Cover) COL channel name VAL Steve Cabral COL description VAL Bettye turned the Beatles "The Word" into a stomping funk workout that bears only a tangential relationship to the original recording on Rubber Soul. She opens the song with the verse instead of the chorus. When she gets to the chorus\, she deploys two simultaneous parts\, rhythmically chanting "say it" while the background singers declaim a facsimile of what the Beatles originally sang. After a minute and a half\, she dispenses with what the Beatles had written\, spending the final two minutes funkifying her way through a kaleidoscope of sections involving James Brown like rhythmic declamations of vocals\, various permutations of the chorus\, a complete and sudden break and instrumental vamps. The result is a stunning revisioning of a song that most of us have had burned into our brains for almost 50 years!	0

COL title VAL The Christmas Song COL performer VAL Clare Teal	COL video title VAL Glen Campbell - The Christmas Song (Merry Christmas To You) Capitol Records 1968 COL channel name VAL ChristmasTimeTV COL description VAL "The Christmas Song" (commonly subtitled "Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire" or\, as it was originally subtitled\, "Merry Christmas to You") is a classic Christmas song written in 1944 by musician\, composer\, and vocalist Mel Tormé and Bob Wells. According to Tormé\, the song was written during a blistering hot summer. In an effort to "stay cool by thinking cool\," the most-performed (according to BMI) Christmas song was born. The Nat King Cole Trio first recorded the song early in 1946. At Cole's behest — and over the objections of his label\, Capitol Records — a second recording was made the same year utilizing a small string section\, this version becoming a massive hit on both the pop and R&B charts. Cole again recorded the song in 1953\, using the same arrangement with a full orchestra arranged and conducted by Nelson Riddle\, and once more in 1961\, in a stereophonic version with orchestra conducted by Ralph Carmichael. Nat King Cole's 1961 version is generally regarded as definitive\, and in 2004 was the most loved seasonal song with women aged 30--49\, while Cole's original 1946 recording was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1974.   Chestnuts roasting on an open fire  Jack Frost nipping at your nose  Yuletide carols being sung by a choir  And folks dressed up like Eskimos   Everybody knows a turkey and some  Mistletoe help to make the season bright  Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow  Will find it hard to sleep tonight   They know that Santa's on his way  He's loaded lots of toys and goodies  On his sleigh  And every mother's  Child is gonna spy to see if  Reindeer really know how to fly   And so\, I'm offering this  Simple phrase to kids from  One to ninety-two  Altho' it's been said many times  Many ways  "Merry Christmas to you"	1

LYRICS There's a village hidden deep in the valley Among the pine trees half forlorn And there on a sunny morning Little Jimmy Brown was born  (bung\, bung\, bung\, bung) All the chapel bells were ringing in the little valley town And the songs that they were singing were for baby Jimmy Brown Then the little congregation prayed for guidance from above Lead us not into temptation\, bless this hour of meditation Guide him with eternal love  There's a village hidden deep in the valley Beneath the mountains high above And there\, twenty years thereafter Jimmy was to meet his love  (bung\, bung\, bung\, bung) All the chapel bells were ringing\, 't was a great day in his life 'cause the songs that they were singing were for Jimmy and his wife Then the little congregation prayed for guidance from above Lead us not into temptation\, bless\, oh Lord this celebration May their lives be filled with love  From the village hidden deep in the valley One rainy morning dark and gray A soul winged its way to heaven Little Jimmy Brown had passed away  (bung\, bung\, bung\, bung) Just a lonely bell was ringing\, in the little valley town it was farewell that they were singing for our little Jimmy Brown And the little congregation prayed for guidance from above Lead us not into temptation\, may his soul find the salvation Of thy great eternal love	0

COL title VAL Hey Joe COL performer VAL The Litter	COL video title VAL Edda Magnasson - Trubbel COL channel name VAL Emilia Arroyo COL description VAL Nu lyser ängarna av sommarns alla blommor. Nu surrar bin\, och fåglar sjunger överallt. Nu stryker vinden genom trädens höga kronor men i min trädgård är det visset\, mörkt och kallt. Här är det risigt och förvuxet\, fult och snårigt och lika hopplöst grått och trist som i mitt bröst. Därute doftar det av sommarns alla dofter. Där är det sommar\, men här inne är det höst.  Jag levde lycklig här med dig och mina katter ett liv i synd och utan omsorg att bli frälst. Försonad med min karaktär\, för jag har aldrig förmott att säga nej till någonting som helst. Och aldrig nekat mig det ena eller andra\, och levat livet\, tills jag krossades en dag. Det börja med att du bedrog mig med en annan\, en som du sa var mycket finare än jag.  Vårt gräl tog veckor\, ropen blandades med gråten och jag blev grundligt jämförd med din fina vän Tills du bekände att hon givit dig på båten Då blev det dödstyst här i trädgården igen! Ifrån den stunden var den kvinnan dubbelt hatad Hon hade lekt med dig\, med oss ett litet slag Och ja jag kände det som även jag var ratad Jag ville slåss\, och gick mot mitt livs nederlag  Jag kom med hammaren beredd under min kappa När hon kom ut i sidenpumps och sa: God dag! Kom in och slå dig ner en stund så får vi prata! Jag bara stammade\, nu minns jag inte vad... Och jag blev bjuden på likör och cigarriller och kunde inte få mig till att säga nej! Och när vi skiljdes var vi bästisar och bundis och jag tog saker som du glömt med hem till dig!  Jag går omkring i mitt pompej\, i bland ruiner och jag traskar runt i resterna utav vårt liv Men du skall aldrig ge mig pikar om sekiner och aldrig skall du bli en annans tidsfördriv! Nej\, åt det gamla skall vi binda vackra kransar och ta vårt liv och mina katter som de är. Och trots all kärleksbrist och trasighet och fransar Dig skall jag älska livet ut\, dig har jag kär!	0

COL title VAL A Song for You COL performer VAL Kirk Whalum	COL video title VAL Gerry Gibbs - 2015 - Live In Studio - 10 Cast Your Fate To The Wind COL channel name VAL JazzTube COL description VAL Personnel Kenny Barron: piano Ron Carter: acoustic bass Gerry Gibbs: drums  Composers Vince Guaraldi  Drummer Gerry Gibbs has been living a recurring dream with slight variations for the past few years. In December of 2012\, he laid down tracks with two of his idols—the legendary Ron Carter and the estimable Kenny Barron—and dubbed their group the Thrasher Dream Trio. The eponymous debut from that band\, featuring fifteen tracks recorded at those sessions\, was\, not surprisingly\, a strong and classy affair filled with standards\, some originals\, and other jazz-friendly fare\, such as Stevie Wonder's "Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing" and Burt Bacharach's "Promises\, Promises."   At the time of that album's release\, those last-mentioned tracks could simply be viewed as part of the well-rounded program. But looking back now\, it actually seems like they were dropped as hints of what was to come. About a year-and-a-half after that first Thrasher Dream Trio album was recorded\, Gibbs brought the band together again to lay things down for We're Back (Whaling City Sound\, 2014)\, a jazz-does-R&B project with A-list guests—vibraphonist Warren Wolf\, saxophonist Steve Wilson\, and organist Larry Goldings. That album offered multiple helpings of Wonder and Earth\, Wind & Fire along with single servings of Bacharach\, Marvin Gaye\, Miles Davis\, and the Average White Band. As on the trio's first album\, the sparks were flying. The playing field\, however\, had changed a bit.   For this\, the third go-around for this group\, Gibbs does it again\, tweaking the formula without altering the essence of the trio. This time he turned the focus toward pop-ish material from the '50s and '60s—the work of Bacharach\, Henry Mancini\, Michel Legrand\, and others of that ilk—and put an audience in front of the band\, recording live at Systems Two Recording Studio. Guests are part of the package again—now it's trumpeter Roy Hargrove and vocalist Cassandra Wilson\, each appearing on a few tracks—and they help to add another wrinkle or two to the project without drawing focus away from the trio.   The album opens on a fluid "Wives And Lovers" that allows Barron's lyricism to shine through\, gives Carter a chance to step into the spotlight\, and puts Gibbs' brushwork at center stage. From there\, the trio moves on with an unusually upbeat take on "The Summer Knows\," a Wilson-enhanced version of "The Look Of Love" that moves from bossa nova to swing\, and a variety of other familiar hits of yesteryear. Hargrove joins in for "On A Clear Day\," quoting Ellington at one point and playfully trading solos with Gibbs; Vince Guaraldi's cheerfulness shines through on a perky trio performance of his "Cast Your Fate To The Wind"; "More" is transformed from a stale confection into an enjoyable swinger; and "Watch What Happens" happens twice—first as a cheerful\, Brazilian-based instrumental\, then as a swing-centered feature for Wilson.   Along the way there are plenty of other bright spots—an appropriately noir-ish "What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life?" with Hargrove on flugelhorn\, a leisurely stroll through "Girl Talk"—and plenty of moments that serve as simple reminders as to why Barron and Carter are loved\, respected\, and emulated the world over. Their time and taste are impeccable\, and when married to Gibbs' in-the-tradition drumming\, you know the music is going to go in the right direction every time.

As a second line of attack he decamped to his home with a pile of recording equipment and a few friends to record a series of tongue in cheek cover version.  Randy Stonehill introduces the songs in the style of an OTT egotistical West Coast DJ\, The Surf Duke\, and frankly this has some hysterically funny moments!  Their acoustic version of Norman Greenbaum's "Spirit In The Sky" is absolutely hilarious!  Larry's imitation of Mick Jagger on the Stones' "Shine A Light" is outrageous and the segue of "Bridge Over Troubled Water"\, "Let It Be" and "My Sweet Lord" is suitably respectful . until we get to the disco break in the latter song and Larry again adopting Mick Jagger mode starts singing\, "I'm So Bored".  Call me iconoclastic but these songs deserve to be ripped apart!  After the Clapton rumors of conversion which surface every five years or so\, "Presence Of The Lord" is given a straight rendition although it's worth bearing in mind Larry reports that Clapton wrote it to express escaping from the police who wanted to bust him for drugs!  This CD release closes with two bonus tracks which did not appear on the original vinyl release.  This time they're introduced by Larry's Big Bomber DJ alter-ego on Radio K.R.A.P. and include another great Mick Jagger impersonation on "I Am Waiting".  Mischievous yet making an important contribution cataloguing counterfeit "Christian" culture.  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Larry's Site: http://www.larrynorman.com/ ----------------------------------------------------------------	0

COL title VAL Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word COL performer VAL Shirley Bassey	COL video title VAL Mario Lanza - The Loveliest Night of the Year - Gordeeva & Grinkov COL channel name VAL MegaMusiclover1234 COL description VAL Photos of M. Lanza\, Ann Blyth\, and champion ice skaters Ekaterina Gordeeva and Sergei Grinkov skating while Lanza sings\, combine the perfection of Mario's voice with the perfection of Gordeeva and Grinkov's ice skating.  Mario Lanza sings "Loveliest Night of the Year" so very beautifully\, he touches your heart. Long may his legacy live through his movies\, his many recordings\, videos on YouTube and through other media outlets. His voice may never be equaled.  This music was first published as a waltz called "Sobre las olas" ("Over the Waves") in 1888 written by Juventino P. Rosas. In 1950 the music was adapted by Irving Aaronson with lyrics by Paul Francis Webster for the movie The Great Caruso. It was recorded by Mario Lanza and became one of the most popular songs of 1951 reaching No. 3 in the US Billboard Charts. (Information from Wikipedia)  Hedda Hopper\, well-known gossip columnist\, believed that "there had never been anyone like Mario\, and I doubt whether we shall ever see his like again."  Special thanks go to the following web sites and their holders and other media for use of their online photos and video which made this video possible:  Most of the photos of Mario Lanza and Ann Blyth were taken from film clips of his film\, "The Great Caruso"; one photo was taken from his film "That Midnight Kiss". Both films are available for purchase online from Turner Classic Movies.  The video of Ekaterina Gordeeva and Sergei Grinkov of the Soviet Union skating in the Pairs' Long Program in the 1988 Winter Games in Calgary\, Alberta\, Canada\, was posted by 3Axel1996 at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0B0tSnQKzwo.  3Axel1996 has over 3\, 441 videos uploaded for your viewing pleasure on YouTube. 3Axel1996 reported that\, "They skated a near flawless program to win the Gold Medal".  Although Sergei Grinkov has since passed away\, may the many videos of his beautiful skating with his lovely wife Ekaterina Gordeeva preserve their incredibly magnificent skating.   The audience applause video clip was taken from a video posted by 08bananapancakes at  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1SwBwZF6t8	0

Columbia 2351 Columbia DC104. First recording of this song by a U.S. group. Yes\, it's the Ramblers\, not the usual sound you might think. The California Ramblers were a popular and prolific jazz group from the 1920s\, that recorded hundreds of songs under many different record labels throughout the 1920s. Three of the members of the band\, Red Nichols\, Jimmy Dorsey\, and Tommy Dorsey\, would go on to front big bands in later decades. The original bandmembers were from Ohio\, but chose the name California Ramblers because they thought people would be less inclined to listen to a jazz band from the Midwest. The Peanut Vendor (original title: El Manisero) is a Cuban song based on a street-seller's cry\, and known as a pregón. It is possibly the most famous piece of music created by a Cuban musician. The Peanut Vendor has been recorded more than 160 times\, sold over a million copies of the sheet music\, and was the first million-selling 78rpm of Cuban music.	0

Darling\, no\, no I can't anymore  It's too late now   All the things we have done together  I relive when we're apart  All the tender fun together  Stays on in my heart   How could I ever close the door  And be the same as I was before?

It is an arrangement of (and an "answer song" to) Bo Diddley's "I'm a Man" (which in turn was inspired by Waters' and Willie Dixon's "Hoochie Coochie Man"). "Mannish Boy" features a repeating stop-time figure on one chord throughout the song and is credited to Waters\, Mel London\, and Bo Diddley.  Muddy Waters versions  The original version of "Mannish Boy" was recorded in Chicago on May 24\, 1955\, under the title "Manish Boy." Accompanying Muddy Waters on vocals and guitar were Jimmy Rogers on guitar\, Junior Wells on harmonica\, Fred Below on drums\, and an un-identified female chorus. The original version was the only recording done by Muddy Waters between January 1953 and June 1957 that did not feature Little Walter on harmonica and was one of few studio recordings with Junior Wells.  Muddy Waters recorded several versions of "Mannish Boy" during his career. In 1968\, he recorded it for the Electric Mud album in Marshall Chess' attempt to attract the rock market. After he left Chess\, he recorded it for the 1977 Hard Again album which was produced by Johnny Winter. The song also was included on the live album Muddy "Mississippi" Waters - Live (1979).  Charts and accolades  The song reached #5 during a stay of six weeks in the Billboard R&B chart. The song was Muddy Waters only chart appearance on the UK Singles Chart peaking at #51.  In 1986\, Muddy Waters' original "Mannish Boy" was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame "Classics of Blues Recordings" category. It was also included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's list of the "500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll". "Mannish Boy" is ranked #229 in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the "500 Greatest Songs of All Time".  Cover versions  A cover by Jimi Hendrix appears on the compilation album Blues.  Paul Butterfield covered the song in 1986 on his album The Legendary Paul Butterfield Rides Again.  It was covered by Hindu Love Gods in their album of the same name.  The song also appears on The Bocephus Box\, a three-CD box set by Hank Williams\, Jr.\, released in 2000.  Elliott Murphy covered it in 2005 on Murphy gets Muddy.  The Rolling Stones have often incorporated this song\, among other blues standards\, into their live set\, and it can be heard on the albums Love You Live and Rarities 1971-2003.  Wolfmother did a cover of the song for their special edition version of Cosmic Egg.  Black Stone Cherry performed a heavier version along with Hoochie Coochie Man in October 2009 at Rockaplast in Germany.  It was further rearranged in the 2003 Martin Scorsese documentary film series titled The Blues. In the fifth film\, titled Godfathers and Sons and directed by Marc Levin\, Mannish Boy was redone by The ElectriK Mud Kats (a.k.a. The Electric Mud Band\, Muddy Waters' backing group from his album Electric Mud) with vocals by hip hop artists Chuck D\, Common & Kyle Jason.  Roger Daltrey performed a cover of the song on Jools Holland's New Years show on December 31\, 2010.  A version of the song recorded by Erykah Badu was featured in an H&M TV advert in spring 2011.  Aerosmith performed the song on The Howard Stern Show on January 13\, 1995.	0

Wir brauchten früher keine große Reise. Wie wurden braun auf Borkum und auf Sylt. Doch heute sind die Braunen nur noch Weiße. Denn hier wird man ja doch nur tiefgekühlt.  Ja früher gab's noch Hitzefrei. Das Freibad war schon auf im Mai. Ich saß bis in die Nacht vor unserem Haus. Da hatten wir noch Sonnenbrand und Riesenquallen an dem Strand\, und Eis und jeder Schutzmann zog die Jacke aus.  Wann wird's mal wieder richtig Sommer -  ein Sommer wie er früher einmal war? Ja mit Sonnenschein von Juni bis September und nicht so naß und so sibirisch wie im letzten Jahr.  Na na na ... la la la ...  Und was wir da für Hitzewellen hatten Pulloverfabrikanten gingen ein. Da gab es bis zu 40 Grad im Schatten Wir mußten mit dem Wasser sparsam sein.  Die Sonne knallte ins Gesicht da brauchte man die Sauna nicht. Ein Schaf war damals froh wenn man es schor Es war hier wie in Afrika Wer durfte machte FKK Doch heut\, heut summen alle Mücken laut im Chor  Wann wird's mal wieder richtig Sommer -  ein Sommer wie er früher einmal war?

It is an arrangement of (and an "answer song" to) Bo Diddley's "I'm a Man" (which in turn was inspired by Waters' and Willie Dixon's "Hoochie Coochie Man"). "Mannish Boy" features a repeating stop-time figure on one chord throughout the song and is credited to Waters\, Mel London\, and Bo Diddley.  Muddy Waters versions  The original version of "Mannish Boy" was recorded in Chicago on May 24\, 1955\, under the title "Manish Boy." Accompanying Muddy Waters on vocals and guitar were Jimmy Rogers on guitar\, Junior Wells on harmonica\, Fred Below on drums\, and an un-identified female chorus. The original version was the only recording done by Muddy Waters between January 1953 and June 1957 that did not feature Little Walter on harmonica and was one of few studio recordings with Junior Wells.  Muddy Waters recorded several versions of "Mannish Boy" during his career. In 1968\, he recorded it for the Electric Mud album in Marshall Chess' attempt to attract the rock market. After he left Chess\, he recorded it for the 1977 Hard Again album which was produced by Johnny Winter. The song also was included on the live album Muddy "Mississippi" Waters - Live (1979).  Charts and accolades  The song reached #5 during a stay of six weeks in the Billboard R&B chart. The song was Muddy Waters only chart appearance on the UK Singles Chart peaking at #51.  In 1986\, Muddy Waters' original "Mannish Boy" was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame "Classics of Blues Recordings" category. It was also included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's list of the "500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll". "Mannish Boy" is ranked #229 in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the "500 Greatest Songs of All Time".  Cover versions  A cover by Jimi Hendrix appears on the compilation album Blues.  Paul Butterfield covered the song in 1986 on his album The Legendary Paul Butterfield Rides Again.  It was covered by Hindu Love Gods in their album of the same name.  The song also appears on The Bocephus Box\, a three-CD box set by Hank Williams\, Jr.\, released in 2000.  Elliott Murphy covered it in 2005 on Murphy gets Muddy.  The Rolling Stones have often incorporated this song\, among other blues standards\, into their live set\, and it can be heard on the albums Love You Live and Rarities 1971-2003.  Wolfmother did a cover of the song for their special edition version of Cosmic Egg.  Black Stone Cherry performed a heavier version along with Hoochie Coochie Man in October 2009 at Rockaplast in Germany.  It was further rearranged in the 2003 Martin Scorsese documentary film series titled The Blues. In the fifth film\, titled Godfathers and Sons and directed by Marc Levin\, Mannish Boy was redone by The ElectriK Mud Kats (a.k.a. The Electric Mud Band\, Muddy Waters' backing group from his album Electric Mud) with vocals by hip hop artists Chuck D\, Common & Kyle Jason.  Roger Daltrey performed a cover of the song on Jools Holland's New Years show on December 31\, 2010.  A version of the song recorded by Erykah Badu was featured in an H&M TV advert in spring 2011.  Aerosmith performed the song on The Howard Stern Show on January 13\, 1995.	0

Performed by dozens of the most important artists of the 20th Century\, this song had also been recorded by Marlene Dietrich\, who created one of its artistically most significant interpretations. I’m glad I can present it today recorded straight from the original shellac and without any remastering done to it. Marlene’s singing paints a poignant and true scene of the farewell between the lovers and through the German lyrics\, she adds the ambiguous and somewhat mysterious beauty to her creation.	0

COL title VAL Ev'rytime We Say Goodbye COL performer VAL Eydie Gorme	COL video title VAL Sarah Vaughan - Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye (Roulette Records 1961) COL channel name VAL RoundMidnightTV COL description VAL "Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye" is a song with lyrics and music by Cole Porter. It was introduced in 1944 in Billy Rose's musical revue\, Seven Lively Arts. The bit where it goes 'from major to minor'\, the harmony actually goes from minor to dominant. The song has since become a jazz standard after gaining popularity in the late 50's and early 60's.  Note: Many artists have replaced the apostrophe in "ev'ry" with an "e" and have combined "time" to form the more common "everytime."  After Hours is a 1961 studio album by American jazz singer Sarah Vaughan. This was Vaughan's first album with just guitar and double bass accompaniment\, it was followed by 1963's Sarah + 2 in a similar vein.  The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow awarded After Hours three stars and said that "the emphasis throughout is exclusively on Sassy's magnificent voice. The program mostly sticks to ballads\, with a couple of exceptions...and is a quiet and intimate affair\, with Vaughan more subtle than she sometimes was. Despite a lightweight version of "My Favorite Things" that will not remind listeners of John Coltrane\, this is an excellent if brief set (34-and-a-half minutes) with some fine jazz singing".  Sarah's accompanied by Mundell Lowe (guitar) and  George Duvivier (double bass).  Pictured along with Sarah in video is Richard Davis.  Recorded in RKO-Path Studio\, New York City\, July 18\, 1961. (Roulette Records)  Everytime we say goodbye\, I die a little\, Why the Gods above me\, who must be in the know. Think so little of me\, they allow you to go.  When you're near\, there's such an air of spring about it\, I can hear a lark somewhere\, begin to sing about it\, There's no love song finer\,  But how strange the change from major to minor\, Everytime we say goodbye.

It was first featured in the 1940 Broadway revue Two for the Show\, where it was sung by Alfred Drake and Frances Comstock.  In "Two for the Show"\, this was a rare serious moment in an otherwise humorous revue. The song was sung\, in a slow fox trot tempo\, by a group of evening-dressed people walking along a London street. At the end\, they all looked at the sky\, and cowered\, obviously terrified: quick curtain. It was 1940\, and the time of the London blitz: a clear night meant "bomber's moon".  The earliest recorded hit version was by Benny Goodman & His Orchestra. It was recorded February 7\, 1940 and released by Columbia Records as catalog number 35391\, with the flip side "Fable of the Rose". The Les Paul Trio recorded a version released as V-Disc 540B with a spoken introduction which was issued in November\, 1945 by the U.S. War Department. In 1948\, bandleader Stan Kenton enjoyed some success with his version of the tune. The recording\, with a vocal by June Christy\, was released by Capitol Records as catalog number 911 (with the flip side "Willow\, Weep for Me") and 15117(with the flip side "Interlude"). It reached the Billboard magazine Best Seller chart on July 9\, 1948\, its only week on the chart\, at #27.  The best-known recording of the song is by Les Paul and Mary Ford\, made on January 4\, 1951. The record was released by Capitol Records as catalog number 1451\, with the flip side "Walkin' and Whistlin' Blues"\, and spent 25 weeks (beginning on March 23\, 1951) on the Billboard chart\, 9 weeks at #1. The record was subsequently re-released by Capitol as catalog number 1675\, with "Josephine" on the B-side.  The song was sung in various recordings by Ella Fitzgerald\, becoming (with the Gershwin's "Oh\, Lady Be Good!") Ella's signature tune. She first performed the song at Carnegie Hall on September 29\, 1947. Her first recording\, backed by the Daydreamers\, was recorded December 20\, 1947 and released by Decca Records as catalog number 24387\, with the flip side "You Turned the Tables on Me". Her most celebrated recording of "How High the Moon" is on her 1960 album Ella in Berlin\, and her version was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2002\, which is a special Grammy award established in 1973 to honor recordings that are at least twenty-five years old\, and that have "qualitative or historical significance."  "At Mister Kelly's" is a 1957 live album by American jazz singer Sarah Vaughan\, recorded at Mister Kelly's jazz club in Chicago. The Allmusic review by John Bush awarded the album four and a half stars and said that At Mister Kelly's captures Vaughan at her "best and most relaxed"\, stating that "her unerring sense of rhythm carries her through every song on this set\, whether the occasion calls for playfulness and wit ("Thou Swell\," "Honeysuckle Rose") or a world-wise melancholia ("Willow Weep for Me")". Bush also praises Jimmy Jones and Roy Haynes.  Sarah's accompanied by Jimmy Jones (piano)\, Richard Davis (bass) & Roy Haynes (drums).  Recorded in Chicago\, Illinois\, August 6-8\, 1957.

COL title VAL Summertime (Guajira) COL performer VAL Ray Barretto	COL video title VAL Burl Ives ft Owen Bradley & Orchestra - A Holly Jolly Christmas (MCA Records 1965) COL channel name VAL ChristmasTimeTV COL description VAL "A Holly Jolly Christmas" is a popular song written by Johnny Marks.  Although he was Jewish\, he specialized in Christmas songs and wrote many standards including "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\," "I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day\," "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\, and "Run Rudolph Run."  This song was first recorded by the Quinto Sisters and later by Burl Ives.  The guitarist is Harold Ray Bradley\, the brother of the musical director Owen Bradley.  Burl Icle Ivanhoe Ives (June 14\, 1909 – April 14\, 1995) was an American singer and actor of stage\, screen\, radio and television.  He began as an itinerant singer and banjoist\, and launched his own radio show\, The Wayfaring Stranger\, which popularized traditional folk songs. In 1942 he appeared in Irving Berlin's This Is the Army\, and then became a major star of CBS radio. In the 1960s he successfully crossed over into country music\, recording hits such as "A Little Bitty Tear" and "Funny Way of Laughing". A popular film actor through the late 1940s and 1950s\, Ives's best-known roles in that medium included parts in So Dear to My Heart and Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\, as well as Rufus Hannassey in The Big Country\, for which he won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.  Ives is often remembered for his starring role in the 1964 Christmas stop-motion television special Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\, which continues to air on CBS every Christmas season\, as the voice of "Sam the Snowman"\, the special's host and narrator.  Have a holly\, jolly Christmas;  It's the best time of the year  I don't know if there'll be snow  but have a cup of cheer  Have a holly\, jolly Christmas;  And when you walk down the street  Say Hello to friends you know  and everyone you meet   Oh ho  the mistletoe  hung where you can see;  Somebody waits for you;  Kiss her once for me  Have a holly jolly Christmas  and in case you didn't hear  Oh by golly  have a holly  jolly Christmas this year	0

COL title VAL It Might as Well Be Spring COL performer VAL Johnny Smith Trio	COL video title VAL IRENE REID save your love for me (1965) COL channel name VAL OubaelPhoumet COL description VAL album : Room for one more.  Room for One More pairs singer Irene Reid with arranger Oliver Nelson and a sprawling who's who of session players including Thad Jones\, Charlie Mariano\, Kenny Burrell\, Phil Woods\, and J.J. Johnson. The title's more than a bit tongue in cheek\, of course\, but given the stature of her collaborators\, Reid no doubt felt some pressure to prove herself worthy of occupying the same studio space\, let alone to claim top billing\, but she does so admirably\, rendering classics like "Save Your Love for Me" and "I Wonder Where Our Love Has Gone" with extraordinary emotional potency. Although best suited for ballads\, most notably a breathtaking reading of "Who Can I Turn To?\," Reid is such a nimble stylist that even a throwaway number like the Bewitched theme still makes its mark. Nelson's spacious arrangements are sublime\, and it almost goes without saying that the band is exemplary. In short\, a wonderful if little-known LP in desperate need of reissue.	0

COL title VAL That's All COL performer VAL Bobby Scott and His Trio	COL video title VAL That's All By Mel Torme COL channel name VAL texpaco COL description VAL Mel Tormé was an American musician and singer best known for his classic jazz vocals.  He was also a jazz composer and arranger\, a drummer\, an actor in radio\, film\, and television\, and the author of five books.  He co-wrote the classic holiday song "The Christmas Song" ("Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire") with Bob Wells.  In 1944 he formed the vocal quintet "Mel Tormé and His Mel-Tones"\, modeled on Frank Sinatra and The Pied Pipers.  His appearance in the 1947 film musical "Good News" made him a teen idol for several years.  His 1949 composition "California Suite" became Capitol Records' first 12-inch LP album.  His recording of "Careless Hands" was his only #1 hit\, although "Again" and "Blue Moon" became his signature tunes.  His singing at New York's Copacabana led a local disc jockey to give him the nickname "The Velvet Fog".  His last hit was the 1962 R&B song "Comin' Home\, Baby" which reached #36 on the pop chart.  In February 1999\, Tormé was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.  This selection is the title song from his album "That's All" released in 1965.	1

I stood up to say goodbye like all the rest. And I heard him tell the warden\, just before he reached my cell: "Let my guitar playing friend do my request."  "Let him sing me back home\, with a song I used to hear. And make my old mem`ries come alive. And take me away and turn back the years. And sing me back home before I die."  I recall last Sunday morning\, a choir from off the streets. Came in to sing a few old gospel songs. And I heard him tell the singers: "There`s a song my Mama sang. Could I hear it once before you move along?"  "Let him sing me back home\, with a song I used to hear. And make my old mem`ries come alive And take me away and turn back the years. And sing me back home before I die."  "And sing me back home before I die."	0

Wew!   Hey\, have a lot of you heard the new song by Nena - "99 Red Balloons"? You know\, I heard the German version of that song first\, and I really liked it. But then I heard the English version\, and I was really surprised to find that what she's singing in English and what she's singing in German are not even close. Uh\, I ended up buying the record\, and I listened very closely to the German version\, and I've come up with a new English translation that I think is really much more accurate\, much closer... I have to admit there are a couple of lines in this new English version that I'm not real sure about\, but I think it's a much more accurate version. Now this is the new version\, "99 Red Balloons".  Hello Bobby my old friend. It's good to see you once again. How's your mother\, how's your aunt? How's your father's skin diving suit? (That's one of the lines I'm not real sure about\, but it goes something like this.)  I've got something you should see Back at my place; come with me. I've got some brand new furnishings\, Plus 99 dead baboons  99 dead baboons Sitting in my living room. Not too functional it seems\, But quite a conversation piece. This one's Jake\, that one's Dinah\, There's big Ned in my recliner. No it's not a lazy boy. Can't you see it's a dead baboon?  Dead baboons\, dead baboons. Dead baboons\, dead baboons.  How they got here I'm not sure; Woke up one day\, there they were. Luckily I've got a lease Allowing pets if they're deceased. I'm just thankful they're not apes\, 'Cuz apes would clash with the drapes. No more napkins at my parties - Wipe your hands on a dead baboon.  Dead baboons\, dead baboons. Dead baboons\, dead baboons.  Dead baboons are lots of fun; Playin' water balloons I've always won. You can keep your dead giraffes and swine\, I'll take dead baboons every time. There's just one problem I have found: It's finding Purina Dead Baboon Chow. But what a happy snorkelling device... (That's another line I'm not real sure about\, but it's somethin' like that) With 99 dead baboons.  Dead baboons\, dead baboons. Dead baboons\, dead baboons.	0

COL title VAL The Green Leaves of Summer COL performer VAL Chet Atkins and Hank Snow	COL video title VAL Perez Prado - Guaglione (1958) COL channel name VAL Moraito COL description VAL Perez Prado (1958) Guaglione is a Neapolitan song with music by Giuseppe Fanciulli and words by Nicola "Nisa" Salerno. It was the winning song at the IV Napoli Song Festival broadcast by radio in 1956. The song's title means simply "boy" in Neapolitan language but as slang translates to "street bum"\, "urchin"\, "back street boy"\, "corner boy" or "street tough". The word guaglione has appeared as "wallyo" in New York immigrant slang. The song has been covered by various artists\, including Italian bandleader Renzo Arbore\, and Italian singers Claudio Villa\, Aurelio Fierro and Renato Carosone. Under the title "The Man Who Plays the Mandolino"\, with a lyric in English\, Dean Martin sang it in 1956 after Fred Raphael of Walt Disney Music Company obtained for Disney the U.S. publishing rights. The best known version of "Guaglione" was recorded by the Cuban bandleader Perez Prado in 1958 as an uptempo mambo tune. As a mambo\, the track rose to fame in 1995 after it was used for the Guinness advert "Anticipation". It has since been featured as the intro music for the 1996 video game Kingdom O' Magic\, and more recently as the opening music for the television showJimmy's Farm. The song is one of Disney's biggest profit makers. Written by G. Fanciulli &\, Nisa and produced by Herman Diaz\, Jr. All music or related performances remain the sole property of their respective copyright holders.

Leur culpabilité est extrêmement controversée aussi bien à l'époque que par la suite\, et plusieurs œuvres artistiques leur ont rendu hommage.  Paroles Françaises de Georges Moustaki\, enregistrée en 1971 par Les Compagnons de la Chanson  Comme en Europe\, les années 1919-1920 sont difficiles aux États-Unis : il faut reconvertir l'économie de guerre et faire face à l'inflation. La fin du dirigisme étatique mis en place en 1917 et la montée du syndicalisme provoquent de nombreuses grèves dans tout le pays. En 1919\, on recense 4\,1 millions de grévistes qui réclament de meilleurs salaires et une réduction du temps de travail. Les grèves dégénèrent en violences et donnent lieu à des affrontements dans plusieurs grandes villes\, comme à Boston1.  Face à ce climat social\, l'année 1925 est marquée par de nombreux attentats anarchistes : les responsables politiques sont touchés\, comme le maire de Seattle ou celui de Cleveland\, chez lequel une bombe explose. Les bureaux de la banque Morgan à Wall Street sont soufflés par un attentat qui fait 38 morts et 200 blessés2. Les autorités prennent des mesures de répression contre les anarchistes mais aussi contre les communistes et les socialistes américains. Certains sont emprisonnés\, d'autres contraints de s'exiler. L'opinion publique amalgame les grévistes\, les étrangers et « les Rouges ». Elle craint la progression du bolchévisme en Europe\, le terrorisme de gauche et se méfie des immigrés récemment arrivés qui parlent à peine l'anglais. Cette période est connue sous le terme de « Peur rouge ».  Le premier procès débute le 22 juin 1920. Un certain nombre de témoins à charge qui n'ont vu le braquage que de loin affirment avoir « reconnu » des Italiens\, notamment l'un portant une moustache comme celle de Vanzetti\, le débat portant sur la longueur de cette moustache. Les témoins à décharge\, des immigrés italiens supposés être d'accointance avec les milieux anarchistes\, sont ignorés bien qu'ils leur fournissent un alibi à Vanzetti1.  Le 16 août 1920\, Vanzetti seul est condamné pour le premier braquage de 12 à 15 ans de prison\, Nicola Sacco ayant pu prouver qu'il avait pointé à l'usine le jour de ce premier braquage.  Le second procès qui a lieu à Dedham du 31 mai au 14 juillet 1921 met surtout en scène l'expertise en balistique\, encore balbutiante à cette époque\, Vanzetti portant selon l’accusation un pistolet de calibre 38 qui aurait appartenu à l’une des victimes et Sacco un Colt automatique de calibre 32 dont les quatre balles trouvées sur les lieux du braquage avaient été tirées par un pistolet de même calibre. Ce second procès les condamne tous les deux à la peine capitale pour les crimes de South Braintree\, dans la banlieue de Boston\, malgré le manque de preuves formelles. Carlo Tresca et Aldino Felicani (vieil ami de Vanzetti)\, deux militants de l'Industrial Workers of the World et quelques représentants de la bourgeoisie libérale bostonienne lancent une campagne médiatique nationale et internationale en leur faveur\, montant dès le 9 mai un comité de défense qui parviendra à lever pendant 7 ans un fonds de 300 000 dollars\, fonds dans lequel puisera leur avocat californien Fred Moore\, spécialisé dans les procès politiques\, pour effectuer ses propres enquêtes5. Dès lors\, des comités de défense se mettent en place dans le monde entier pour sensibiliser l'opinion sur cette injustice : Benito Mussolini prend même leur défense6. Comme Sacco en 1923\, Vanzetti est placé début 1925 en hôpital psychiatrique. Le 12 mai 1926\, leur condamnation à mort est confirmée. En novembre 1925\, un bandit dénommé Celestino Madeiros\, cependant déjà condamné à mort dans une autre affaire7\, avoue de sa prison être l'auteur\, avec des membres du gang de Joe Morelli\, du braquage de South Braintree\, mais le juge Webster Thayer (en)\, vieil Américain de souche blanche qui n'aimait ni les Italiens\, ni les anarchistes6\, refuse de rouvrir le dossier. Malgré une mobilisation internationale intense8 et le report à plusieurs reprises de l'exécution\, Nicola Sacco\, Bartolomeo Vanzetti et Celestino Madeiros sont exécutés par chaise électrique dans la nuit du 22 au 23 août 1927\, à la Prison de Charlestown (en) dans la banlieue de Boston\, par le célèbre bourreau Robert G. Elliott9\, suscitant une immense réprobation.	0

COL title VAL I Want to Hold Your Hand COL performer VAL Duke Ellington	COL video title VAL Gerry Gibbs - 2015 - Live In Studio - 10 Cast Your Fate To The Wind COL channel name VAL JazzTube COL description VAL Personnel Kenny Barron: piano Ron Carter: acoustic bass Gerry Gibbs: drums  Composers Vince Guaraldi  Drummer Gerry Gibbs has been living a recurring dream with slight variations for the past few years. In December of 2012\, he laid down tracks with two of his idols—the legendary Ron Carter and the estimable Kenny Barron—and dubbed their group the Thrasher Dream Trio. The eponymous debut from that band\, featuring fifteen tracks recorded at those sessions\, was\, not surprisingly\, a strong and classy affair filled with standards\, some originals\, and other jazz-friendly fare\, such as Stevie Wonder's "Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing" and Burt Bacharach's "Promises\, Promises."   At the time of that album's release\, those last-mentioned tracks could simply be viewed as part of the well-rounded program. But looking back now\, it actually seems like they were dropped as hints of what was to come. About a year-and-a-half after that first Thrasher Dream Trio album was recorded\, Gibbs brought the band together again to lay things down for We're Back (Whaling City Sound\, 2014)\, a jazz-does-R&B project with A-list guests—vibraphonist Warren Wolf\, saxophonist Steve Wilson\, and organist Larry Goldings. That album offered multiple helpings of Wonder and Earth\, Wind & Fire along with single servings of Bacharach\, Marvin Gaye\, Miles Davis\, and the Average White Band. As on the trio's first album\, the sparks were flying. The playing field\, however\, had changed a bit.   For this\, the third go-around for this group\, Gibbs does it again\, tweaking the formula without altering the essence of the trio. This time he turned the focus toward pop-ish material from the '50s and '60s—the work of Bacharach\, Henry Mancini\, Michel Legrand\, and others of that ilk—and put an audience in front of the band\, recording live at Systems Two Recording Studio. Guests are part of the package again—now it's trumpeter Roy Hargrove and vocalist Cassandra Wilson\, each appearing on a few tracks—and they help to add another wrinkle or two to the project without drawing focus away from the trio.   The album opens on a fluid "Wives And Lovers" that allows Barron's lyricism to shine through\, gives Carter a chance to step into the spotlight\, and puts Gibbs' brushwork at center stage. From there\, the trio moves on with an unusually upbeat take on "The Summer Knows\," a Wilson-enhanced version of "The Look Of Love" that moves from bossa nova to swing\, and a variety of other familiar hits of yesteryear. Hargrove joins in for "On A Clear Day\," quoting Ellington at one point and playfully trading solos with Gibbs; Vince Guaraldi's cheerfulness shines through on a perky trio performance of his "Cast Your Fate To The Wind"; "More" is transformed from a stale confection into an enjoyable swinger; and "Watch What Happens" happens twice—first as a cheerful\, Brazilian-based instrumental\, then as a swing-centered feature for Wilson.   Along the way there are plenty of other bright spots—an appropriately noir-ish "What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life?" with Hargrove on flugelhorn\, a leisurely stroll through "Girl Talk"—and plenty of moments that serve as simple reminders as to why Barron and Carter are loved\, respected\, and emulated the world over. Their time and taste are impeccable\, and when married to Gibbs' in-the-tradition drumming\, you know the music is going to go in the right direction every time.

So let the wonder take you into space And lay you under its loving embrace Feel the thunder as it warms your face you can't hold back.  Just let your love flow like a mountain stream And let your love grow with the smallest of dreams And let your love show and you'll know what I mean\, it's the season	0

COL title VAL She Moved Through the Fair COL performer VAL Peter Hollens	COL video title VAL Marlene Dietrich  - Sag mir "Adieu" (Time On My Hands) 1950 COL channel name VAL 240252 COL description VAL Marlene Dietrich & Orch. dir. by Jimmie Carroll – Time On My Hands [Sag mir Adieu] (Music: Youmans\, German lyrics: L.Metzl) Columbia 1950 (Recorded in USA; Sung in German)   NOTE: I absolutely love Vincent Youmans and I think “Time On My Hands” along with a haunting tango “Orchids In the Moonlight” belongs to his most beautiful compositions. Performed by dozens of the most important artists of the 20th Century\, this song had also been recorded by Marlene Dietrich\, who created one of its artistically most significant interpretations. I’m glad I can present it today recorded straight from the original shellac and without any remastering done to it. Marlene’s singing paints a poignant and true scene of the farewell between the lovers and through the German lyrics\, she adds the ambiguous and somewhat mysterious beauty to her creation.	0

COL title VAL Bye Bye Blackbird COL performer VAL Jimmy Scott	COL video title VAL Mountain Greenery - The Supremes COL channel name VAL MotownConnoisseur30 COL description VAL In 1966\, the Supremes joined numerous popular artists at the time to film a TV special called "Rodgers & Hart Today" where they performed the timeless and classics songs of the Rodgers & Hart songbook. Berry Gordy\, along with Gil Askey\, teamed up to record an album for the Supremes singing the Rodgers & Hart songbook and for it to coincide with the airing of the TV special. The girls recorded over 26 songs with Motown planning to release the album as a 2-LP set. However it was cut down to just 12 songs with the other 14 recordings remaining in the Motown vaults until the 1980's. "The Supremes Sing Rodgers & Hart" was released in May 1967 to critical acclaim. Ranging from big band to jazz to the modern sounds of Motown\, the album proved the Supremes could sing anything. It was versatility at its finest.

COL title VAL When You Wish upon a Star COL performer VAL Heather Pierson	COL video title VAL Gustav Winckler - Når du ser et stjerneskud (When You Wish Upon a Star) COL channel name VAL stigekalder COL description VAL ★★★ My playlist with Gustav Winckler Christmas songs: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFD92160049A76D3B  Gustav Winckler (1925 - 1979): NÅR DU SER ET STJERNESKUD  This is the Danish version of "When You Wish Upon a Star"\, which was written by Ned Washington and Leigh Harline and introduced in the 1940 Walt Disney movie Pinocchio\, where it is sung by Cliff Edwards.   In Denmark (as in the other Nordic countries + Japan)\, the song has become a Christmas song\, often referring to the Star of Bethlehem. The Danish title roughly translates as "When you see a shooting star". The song is played on television every Christmas Eve's day in the traditional Disney one-hour Christmas cabaret\, and the gathering of the entire family for the watching of this\, is considered a Nordic tradition.  Når du ser et stjerneskud lad dit ønske flyve ud\, da vil alle stjerners herre  høre dig. Bare du af hjertet tror\, da er ingen bøn for stor når et stjerneskud\, der falder  på din vej.  Skæbnen selv er da din lykkes smed\, den blinker til dig ned fra himlens stjerner.  Når du ser et stjerneskud\, da er det et himlens bud om at du skal vinde\, hvad du ønsker dig.  (Danish version by Mogens Dam)  Gustav Winckler was a popular Danish singer\, composer and music publisher. He is widely considered the best Danish crooner ever\, and was often compared to Bing Crosby. In 1957 after qualifying in "Dansk Melodi Grand Prix" to represent Denmark at the Eurovision Song Contest\, he participated in Eurovision Song Contest 1957 where he sung "Skibet skal sejle i nat" ("The ship is leaving tonight") with Birthe Wilke. They ranked number 3\, and stunned television audiences with a 13-second long kiss at the end of their performance. Winckler died in a car accident in 1979.

The record reached #2 on the Billboard chart and was a million seller. The B-side\, "Rose\, Rose\, I Love You"\, was a hit too and reached #3.  The title refers to the biblical woman Jezebel of the Old Testament.  Covers  Edith Piaf and Charles Aznavour recorded a French version of the song. Brazilian singer Leny Eversong recorded another popular version in the early 1950s. Alexander Veljanov recorded a cover of the song.

Influence of the song  Leonard Cohen's song "Memories" from the 1977 album Death of a Ladies' Man starts with the line: 'Frankie Lane\, he was singing Jezebel'.  The first helicopter in the Netherlands\, a Sikorsky S-51 H-1\, was bought in 1951 by the Royal Netherlands Navy. There the heli was called 'Jezebel' after Frankie Laine's song.  ------------------------  Lyrics  If ever the devil was born\, Without a pair of horns It was you\, Jezebel\, it was you.

Nikola\, a good friend of ours from Paris\, who passed away a few years ago\, loved Bob Dylan.

COL title VAL Pastures of Plenty COL performer VAL The Kingston Trio	COL video title VAL Haydn Quartet - Harry MacDonough - Take Me Out To The Ball Game 1908 NY Yankees New York NYC Bronx COL channel name VAL warholsoup100 COL description VAL This Charted at #1 in 1908. US Billboard #1 - Oct 1908 (16 weeks) Victor Recordings. Most people don't realize that the famous "Take Me Out To the Ball Game" song was inspired by another song that was written in 1858\, which was called "The Baseball Polka!" Jack Norworth\, who while riding a subway train\, was inspired by a sign that said "Baseball Today — Polo Grounds". In the song\, Katie's (and later Nelly's) beau calls to ask her out to see a show. She accepts the date\, but only if her date will take her out to the ballgame. The words were set to music by Albert Von Tilzer\, (Norworth and Von Tilzer finally saw their first Major League Baseball games 32 and 20 years later\, respectively). The song was first sung by Norworth's then-wife Nora Bayes and popularized by many other vaudeville acts. It was played at a ballpark for the first known time in 1934\, at a high-school game in Los Angeles\, and researchers think it made its debut at a major-league park later that year. Norworth wrote an alternative version of the song in 1927. (Norworth and Bayes were famous for writing and performing such smash hits as "Shine On\, Harvest Moon".) With the sale of so many records\, sheet music\, and piano rolls\, the song became one of the most popular hits of 1908. The Haydn Quartet singing group\, led by popular tenor Harry MacDonough\, recorded a successful version on Victor Records. Contrary to some sources\, Billy Murray\, although a fan of baseball in general and the New York Giants in particular\, never recorded a version of the song. One of the well-known quartets\, whose sessions frequently included Murray\, did record the song\, but without Murray\, leading to some confusion in some of the record catalogues. The confusion\, nonetheless\, is so pervasive that\, when "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" was selected by the National Endowment for the Arts and the Recording Industry Association of America as one of the 365 top "Songs of the Century"\, the song was credited to Billy Murray\, implying his recording of it as having received the most votes among songs from the first decade. The first recorded version was by Edward Meeker. Meeker's recording was selected by the Library of Congress as a 2010 addition to the National Recording Registry\, which selects recordings annually that are "culturally\, historically\, or aesthetically significant". 1908 Version: Katie Casey was baseball mad\, Had the fever and had it bad. Just to root for the home town crew\, Ev'ry sou Katie blew. On a Saturday her young beau Called to see if she'd like to go To see a show\, but Miss Kate said "No\, I'll tell you what you can do:" Take me out to the ball game\, Take me out with the crowd; Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack\, I don't care if I never get back. Let me root\, root\, root for the home team\, If they don't win\, it's a shame. For it's one\, two\, three strikes\, you're out\, At the old ball game. Katie Casey saw all the games\, Knew the players by their first names. Told the umpire he was wrong\, All along\, Good and strong. When the score was just two to two\, Katie Casey knew what to do\, Just to cheer up the boys she knew\, She made the gang sing this song	0

It is an arrangement of (and an "answer song" to) Bo Diddley's "I'm a Man" (which in turn was inspired by Waters' and Willie Dixon's "Hoochie Coochie Man"). "Mannish Boy" features a repeating stop-time figure on one chord throughout the song and is credited to Waters\, Mel London\, and Bo Diddley.  Muddy Waters versions  The original version of "Mannish Boy" was recorded in Chicago on May 24\, 1955\, under the title "Manish Boy." Accompanying Muddy Waters on vocals and guitar were Jimmy Rogers on guitar\, Junior Wells on harmonica\, Fred Below on drums\, and an un-identified female chorus. The original version was the only recording done by Muddy Waters between January 1953 and June 1957 that did not feature Little Walter on harmonica and was one of few studio recordings with Junior Wells.  Muddy Waters recorded several versions of "Mannish Boy" during his career. In 1968\, he recorded it for the Electric Mud album in Marshall Chess' attempt to attract the rock market. After he left Chess\, he recorded it for the 1977 Hard Again album which was produced by Johnny Winter. The song also was included on the live album Muddy "Mississippi" Waters - Live (1979).  Charts and accolades  The song reached #5 during a stay of six weeks in the Billboard R&B chart. The song was Muddy Waters only chart appearance on the UK Singles Chart peaking at #51.  In 1986\, Muddy Waters' original "Mannish Boy" was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame "Classics of Blues Recordings" category. It was also included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's list of the "500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll". "Mannish Boy" is ranked #229 in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the "500 Greatest Songs of All Time".  Cover versions  A cover by Jimi Hendrix appears on the compilation album Blues.  Paul Butterfield covered the song in 1986 on his album The Legendary Paul Butterfield Rides Again.  It was covered by Hindu Love Gods in their album of the same name.  The song also appears on The Bocephus Box\, a three-CD box set by Hank Williams\, Jr.\, released in 2000.  Elliott Murphy covered it in 2005 on Murphy gets Muddy.  The Rolling Stones have often incorporated this song\, among other blues standards\, into their live set\, and it can be heard on the albums Love You Live and Rarities 1971-2003.  Wolfmother did a cover of the song for their special edition version of Cosmic Egg.  Black Stone Cherry performed a heavier version along with Hoochie Coochie Man in October 2009 at Rockaplast in Germany.  It was further rearranged in the 2003 Martin Scorsese documentary film series titled The Blues. In the fifth film\, titled Godfathers and Sons and directed by Marc Levin\, Mannish Boy was redone by The ElectriK Mud Kats (a.k.a. The Electric Mud Band\, Muddy Waters' backing group from his album Electric Mud) with vocals by hip hop artists Chuck D\, Common & Kyle Jason.  Roger Daltrey performed a cover of the song on Jools Holland's New Years show on December 31\, 2010.  A version of the song recorded by Erykah Badu was featured in an H&M TV advert in spring 2011.  Aerosmith performed the song on The Howard Stern Show on January 13\, 1995.	0

Performed by dozens of the most important artists of the 20th Century\, this song had also been recorded by Marlene Dietrich\, who created one of its artistically most significant interpretations. I’m glad I can present it today recorded straight from the original shellac and without any remastering done to it. Marlene’s singing paints a poignant and true scene of the farewell between the lovers and through the German lyrics\, she adds the ambiguous and somewhat mysterious beauty to her creation.	0

So Enjoy!  Here's the Lyrics to Her/This version:  "The water is wide\, I cannot cross over  Neither have I wings to fly  Give me a boat that can carry two  And both shall row\, my love and I   There is a ship and she sails the sea  She's loaded deep as deep can be  But not so deep as the love I'm in  I know not how I sink or swim   I leaned my back against some young oak  Thinking that he was a trusty tree  But first he bended\, then he broke  And thus did my false love to be   Oh love is handsome\, love is fine Gay as a jewel when first it's new  But love grows old and waxes cold  And fades away like summer dew   The water is wide\, I cannot cross over  Neither have I wings to fly  Give me a boat that can carry two  And both shall row\, my love and I"  Best possible audio quality I could achieve!

In Denmark (as in the other Nordic countries + Japan)\, the song has become a Christmas song\, often referring to the Star of Bethlehem. The Danish title roughly translates as "When you see a shooting star". The song is played on television every Christmas Eve's day in the traditional Disney one-hour Christmas cabaret\, and the gathering of the entire family for the watching of this\, is considered a Nordic tradition.  Når du ser et stjerneskud lad dit ønske flyve ud\, da vil alle stjerners herre  høre dig. Bare du af hjertet tror\, da er ingen bøn for stor når et stjerneskud\, der falder  på din vej.  Skæbnen selv er da din lykkes smed\, den blinker til dig ned fra himlens stjerner.  Når du ser et stjerneskud\, da er det et himlens bud om at du skal vinde\, hvad du ønsker dig.  (Danish version by Mogens Dam)  Gustav Winckler was a popular Danish singer\, composer and music publisher. He is widely considered the best Danish crooner ever\, and was often compared to Bing Crosby. In 1957 after qualifying in "Dansk Melodi Grand Prix" to represent Denmark at the Eurovision Song Contest\, he participated in Eurovision Song Contest 1957 where he sung "Skibet skal sejle i nat" ("The ship is leaving tonight") with Birthe Wilke. They ranked number 3\, and stunned television audiences with a 13-second long kiss at the end of their performance. Winckler died in a car accident in 1979.

COL title VAL Wear My Ring Around Your Neck COL performer VAL Elvis Presley with The Jordanaires	COL video title VAL ELIO PACE - You Never Can Tell (from the album 'Come And Get It' 2002) 4 of 16 COL channel name VAL rosarecordsonline COL description VAL 'You Never Can Tell' was written and originally recorded by Chuck Berry.  _________________________  A message from Elio...  The original concept behind 'Come And Get It'\, was to produce a high quality demo for me and my band to use as promotion with a view to attracting bigger and better corporate work as a 'covers band'. It was never intended for commercial release. Proving this point\, the original two-thousand CDs pressed in February 2002\, had no barcode on the artwork.  In fact\, the idea (going into the first day of recording) was to record only segments of 10 or 12 songs and to create a five-minute showreel. It was only just as recording was about to commence that Darren Loveday (one of two guitarists in the band at the time and my co-producer on the project) suggested that for the time it took to decide which segment of each song should be recorded\, we may as well play the whole song from start to finish\, especially as we all knew the songs so well\, having played them so many times. It was only when listening back the following day to the 13-tracks we'd recorded\, that Darren and I decided to create a full album of the material.  It was also decided that along with the 13 'new' songs\, we should make use of the 74-minutes available on CD (at the time) and include; a previous demo we'd made in 1998 of Billy Joel's 'My Life'; a live stereo recording (off MiniDisc\, with a few overdubs) of Jerry Lee Lewis' 'Great Balls Of Fire' from August 2000; and demos of three original songs I'd written (Addicted To The Phone\, Got The Bug Back and Katy Likes House) which would eventually be re-recorded and released on my 2009 'debut' album\, 'A Seat At My Table.  The last item that we decided to include on this original 19-track album was a 1998 demo we had recorded of Delbert McClinton's 'Two More Bottles Of Wine'. Ironically\, it was THIS little track (with just myself on piano\, Darren on guitar and the both of us doing the backing vocals and hand-claps) that realised the original concept for this album and opened a huge door for me in my career. Sir Terry Wogan and the late Paul Walters\, working together on BBC Radio 2's 'Wake Up To Wogan'\, played my version of 'Two More Bottles Of Wine' on their show\, once a week for six-months\, from August 2003. It was the first time that one of my recordings had been played on national radio in the UK. I really wasn't prepared for it as I didn't even have a website at the time.  I eventually got my act together and although casually stocked in a hand-full of small record shops\, 'Come And Get It' (on my own label\, Rosa Records) became available to buy in 2005 on CD via my website and then released to the general public as a download in 2007. This digital release and the subsequent CD pressings does not include the three demos of my songs... for obvious reasons. Now discontinued\, you would have to hunt down one of the original batch of those two-thousand CDs pressed in February 2002.  By the way\, the billing as 'The Elio Pace Band' was purely to guarantee that prospective clients knew that they were not booking just an individual at a piano and to differentiate between my two 'hats' as a performer; a) playing 'dance party' covers and b) playing my own material\, for which I would simply be known as Elio Pace. Interestingly\, Terry Wogan never once announced my record as 'The Elio Pace Band'. Instead he always referred to me as "Elio Pace and his band". 'Come And Get It' was the first and only album that will have 'The Elio Pace Band' as the artist name although I fully expect to record another album of covers sometime in the future.  _________________________  Track listing:  1.

In Denmark (as in the other Nordic countries + Japan)\, the song has become a Christmas song\, often referring to the Star of Bethlehem. The Danish title roughly translates as "When you see a shooting star". The song is played on television every Christmas Eve's day in the traditional Disney one-hour Christmas cabaret\, and the gathering of the entire family for the watching of this\, is considered a Nordic tradition.  Når du ser et stjerneskud lad dit ønske flyve ud\, da vil alle stjerners herre  høre dig. Bare du af hjertet tror\, da er ingen bøn for stor når et stjerneskud\, der falder  på din vej.  Skæbnen selv er da din lykkes smed\, den blinker til dig ned fra himlens stjerner.  Når du ser et stjerneskud\, da er det et himlens bud om at du skal vinde\, hvad du ønsker dig.  (Danish version by Mogens Dam)  Gustav Winckler was a popular Danish singer\, composer and music publisher. He is widely considered the best Danish crooner ever\, and was often compared to Bing Crosby. In 1957 after qualifying in "Dansk Melodi Grand Prix" to represent Denmark at the Eurovision Song Contest\, he participated in Eurovision Song Contest 1957 where he sung "Skibet skal sejle i nat" ("The ship is leaving tonight") with Birthe Wilke. They ranked number 3\, and stunned television audiences with a 13-second long kiss at the end of their performance. Winckler died in a car accident in 1979.

COL title VAL We'll Meet Again COL performer VAL Johnny Cash	COL video title VAL Red Patterson's Piedmont Log Rollers - Down on the Banks of the Ohio (1927) COL channel name VAL ArkivArkiv COL description VAL "Banks of the Ohio" is a 19th century murder ballad\, written by unknown authors\, in which "Willie" invites his young lover for a walk during which she rejects his marriage proposal. Once they are alone on the river bank\, he murders the young woman. It is also known by the longer title Down On The Banks Of The Ohio The first recording of the song was by Red Patterson's Piedmont Log Rollers on August 12\, 1927. The song has since been recorded numerous times\, such as by New Lost City Ramblers\, The Wolfe Tones\, G. B. Grayson and Henry Whitter (as "I'll Never Be Yours")\, Ernest Stoneman\, Clayton McMichen\, Bascom Lamar Lunsford\, The Carter Family\, Blue Sky Boys (whose version\, performed in 1936\, appears in the soundtrack of the 1973 film Paper Moon)\, Johnny Cash\, Porter Wagoner\, Pete Seeger\, Monroe Brothers\, Joan Baez\, Olivia Newton-John (with Mike Sammes\, in 1971\, her second commercial single in the United States)\, Dave Guard and the Whiskeyhill Singers\, Mike Ireland and Holler\, The Callagan Brothers\, and Doc Watson\, with slightly different lyrics when sung by a female. The song is similar in subject to "Pretty Polly"\, and likely tells the same story (Both songs date from approximately the same time\, tell roughly the same story\, and feature a villain named "Willie").  Red Patterson's Piedmont Log Rollers: Red Patterson vocals/banjo\, Percy Setcliff violin\, Dick Nolen tenor banjo\, Lee Nolen guitar.	0

A few years later\, Evans explored ten of Hendrix's compositions with his unique 19-piece unit\, an orchestra that included two French horns\, the tuba of Howard Johnson\, three guitars\, two basses\, two percussionists and such soloists as altoist David Sanborn\, trumpeter Marvin "Hannibal" Peterson\, Billy Harper on tenor\, and guitarists Ryo Kawasaki and John Abercrombie. Evans' arrangements uplift many of Hendrix's more blues-oriented compositions and create a memorable set that is rock-oriented but retains the improvisation and personality of jazz.

COL title VAL You Go to My Head COL performer VAL Jan Savitt and His Top Hatters	COL video title VAL Haydn Quartet - Harry MacDonough - Take Me Out To The Ball Game 1908 NY Yankees New York NYC Bronx COL channel name VAL warholsoup100 COL description VAL This Charted at #1 in 1908. US Billboard #1 - Oct 1908 (16 weeks) Victor Recordings. Most people don't realize that the famous "Take Me Out To the Ball Game" song was inspired by another song that was written in 1858\, which was called "The Baseball Polka!" Jack Norworth\, who while riding a subway train\, was inspired by a sign that said "Baseball Today — Polo Grounds". In the song\, Katie's (and later Nelly's) beau calls to ask her out to see a show. She accepts the date\, but only if her date will take her out to the ballgame. The words were set to music by Albert Von Tilzer\, (Norworth and Von Tilzer finally saw their first Major League Baseball games 32 and 20 years later\, respectively). The song was first sung by Norworth's then-wife Nora Bayes and popularized by many other vaudeville acts. It was played at a ballpark for the first known time in 1934\, at a high-school game in Los Angeles\, and researchers think it made its debut at a major-league park later that year. Norworth wrote an alternative version of the song in 1927. (Norworth and Bayes were famous for writing and performing such smash hits as "Shine On\, Harvest Moon".) With the sale of so many records\, sheet music\, and piano rolls\, the song became one of the most popular hits of 1908. The Haydn Quartet singing group\, led by popular tenor Harry MacDonough\, recorded a successful version on Victor Records. Contrary to some sources\, Billy Murray\, although a fan of baseball in general and the New York Giants in particular\, never recorded a version of the song. One of the well-known quartets\, whose sessions frequently included Murray\, did record the song\, but without Murray\, leading to some confusion in some of the record catalogues. The confusion\, nonetheless\, is so pervasive that\, when "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" was selected by the National Endowment for the Arts and the Recording Industry Association of America as one of the 365 top "Songs of the Century"\, the song was credited to Billy Murray\, implying his recording of it as having received the most votes among songs from the first decade. The first recorded version was by Edward Meeker. Meeker's recording was selected by the Library of Congress as a 2010 addition to the National Recording Registry\, which selects recordings annually that are "culturally\, historically\, or aesthetically significant". 1908 Version: Katie Casey was baseball mad\, Had the fever and had it bad. Just to root for the home town crew\, Ev'ry sou Katie blew. On a Saturday her young beau Called to see if she'd like to go To see a show\, but Miss Kate said "No\, I'll tell you what you can do:" Take me out to the ball game\, Take me out with the crowd; Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack\, I don't care if I never get back. Let me root\, root\, root for the home team\, If they don't win\, it's a shame. For it's one\, two\, three strikes\, you're out\, At the old ball game. Katie Casey saw all the games\, Knew the players by their first names. Told the umpire he was wrong\, All along\, Good and strong. When the score was just two to two\, Katie Casey knew what to do\, Just to cheer up the boys she knew\, She made the gang sing this song	0

Kennedy died\, Woody Herman was recording an album for Phillips. The band was playing Bobby Scott's "A Taste of Honey". Everyone had heard the news and there was in that performance a mournfulness that is not in the arrangement\, not in the notes themselves\, but in the attitude in the band\, whose personnel at that period included Nat Pierce\, Sal Nistico\, Phil Wilson\, and Bill Chase. You can hear it in the recording. It is a striking track\, deeply sad\, and it shows how jazz can reflect public events and the consequent more immediately than any other art. Woody finished the take and cancelled the rest of the date.	0

Just let your love flow like a mountain stream And let your love grow with the smallest of dreams And let your love show and you'll know what I mean\, it's the season  Let your love fly like a bird on the wing Aand let your love bind you to all living things Aand let your love shine and you'll know what I mean\, that's the reason  There's a reason for the warm sweet nights There's a reason for the candlelights Must be the season when those love rites shine all around us.  So let the wonder take you into space And lay you under its loving embrace Feel the thunder as it warms your face you can't hold back.  Just let your love flow like a mountain stream And let your love grow with the smallest of dreams And let your love show and you'll know what I mean\, it's the season	0

With the release of A NehoSoul Christmas! Duncan further cements his status as one of Gospel music’s greatest blue-eyed soul singers\, and offers one heck of a stocking stuffer to music fans of all ages.  A true veteran of the “early days\,” Duncan first made his mark in the early 1970s as a member of the influential Jesus Music band Sweet Comfort. Following that band’s breakup in 1984 Duncan embarked on a solo career that is now over twenty years strong\, and has produced over a dozen number one singles. Constant touring and cameo appearances on major compilations made Duncan one of the defining voices of Contemporary Christian music in the 1990s.  ~excerpt from http://www.cbn.com/cbnmusic/Artists/Duncan_Bryan.aspx	0

COL title VAL Big Boss Man COL performer VAL Jerry Lee Lewis	COL video title VAL Mike Bloomfield's Electric Flag with Erma Franklin - Big Boss Man COL channel name VAL Erwin Boermans COL description VAL Live at the Carousel Ballroom\, 21th of April 1968  Erma Franklin - vocals Mike Bloomfield - lead guitar Terry Clements - tenor sax Virgil Gonsalves - baritone sax\, flute Stemsy Hunter - alto sax Marcus Doubleday - trumpet Herbie Rich - organ (possibly some baritone sax on 5) Harvey Brooks - bass Nick Gravenites - lead vocals  Erma Franklin is sister to the well-known Aretha. Erma’s career for Shout! Records resulted in several single releases in 1967 including Big Boss Man  This recording was made when Erma took the stage at the Carousel Ballroom in San Francisco for three nights in April from the 19th to the 21st in 1968. Backing her was Mike Bloomfield’s Electric Flag\, a blues rock group. Much of the research done in identifying the date\, venue and personnel was by Dave M of the westcoastacidandpsychedelia Yahoo group. Says Dave: “The week before at the Carousel (April 14\, 1968)\, there had been an unscheduled Sunday show and jam session featuring Quicksilver Messenger Service and numerous other musicians. The tape circulates\, and since Gary Duncan jokes about Easter Sunday\, it makes it easy to reliably date the show. All this points to another Sunday jam session\, so if I had to guess I would pick Sunday\, April 21 for the date of this show. Anyway\, that’s my story and I’m sticking to it.”	1

MORE ABOUT DOMINIQUE EADE: http://www.dominiqueeade.com/biography.html  MORE ABOUT IRA COLEMAN: World Musician Ira Coleman was born in Stockholm\, Sweden. Raised in Southern France\, Ira thereafter lived in Germany for fourteen years. While in Germany\, Ira Coleman studied double bass at Cologne's "Hochschule für Musik" and subsequently came a move to the US to attend Berklee College of Music in Boston. "I have very strong ties to Europe\," says Ira who is fluent in French and German. "My mother was Swedish and a famous silversmith and designer\, and my father was a painter and graphic artist from Baltimore. The place to go was Paris. My parents met many expatriate artists\, writers and musicians." Among visitors to Ira's childhood home were Louis Armstrong\, Billie Holiday\, Ray Charles\, Charlie Mingus and Chester Himes. Ira got his inspiration at an early age\, though he didn't actually pick up a bass until he was 19 years old. "The bass fits my character\," says Ira\, who graduated from Berklee College of Music in 1985. "In most musical genres the bass is the pivotal center piece\, the instrument which provides a discrete and clear foundation\, and I enjoy the many challenges its function poses." Ira's resumé tells the story. Over the years\, Ira has worked with such well-known figures as Cab Calloway\, Freddie Hubbard\, Betty Carter\, Branford Marsalis\, Herbie Hancock\, Wayne Shorter\, Jessye Norman and Sting. He was musical director for vocalist Dee Dee Bridgewater and toured with her internationally from 2002 until 2009. One night he's on the stage at Carnegie Hall playing in a tribute to African-American culture. The next morning he is on a plane to Europe to collaborate on a recording or heading to Japan for a jazz festival. As comfortable playing Jamaican rhythms as he is accompanying a gospel choir or performing in a Jazz trio\, this professional bass player has built an international reputation for versatility.	0

My parents met many expatriate artists\, writers and musicians." Among visitors to Ira's childhood home were Louis Armstrong\, Billie Holiday\, Ray Charles\, Charlie Mingus and Chester Himes. Ira got his inspiration at an early age\, though he didn't actually pick up a bass until he was 19 years old. "The bass fits my character\," says Ira\, who graduated from Berklee College of Music in 1985. "In most musical genres the bass is the pivotal center piece\, the instrument which provides a discrete and clear foundation\, and I enjoy the many challenges its function poses." Ira's resumé tells the story. Over the years\, Ira has worked with such well-known figures as Cab Calloway\, Freddie Hubbard\, Betty Carter\, Branford Marsalis\, Herbie Hancock\, Wayne Shorter\, Jessye Norman and Sting. He was musical director for vocalist Dee Dee Bridgewater and toured with her internationally from 2002 until 2009. One night he's on the stage at Carnegie Hall playing in a tribute to African-American culture. The next morning he is on a plane to Europe to collaborate on a recording or heading to Japan for a jazz festival. As comfortable playing Jamaican rhythms as he is accompanying a gospel choir or performing in a Jazz trio\, this professional bass player has built an international reputation for versatility.	1

COL title VAL Season of the Witch COL performer VAL The Masked Marauders	COL video title VAL Edda Magnasson - Trubbel COL channel name VAL Emilia Arroyo COL description VAL Nu lyser ängarna av sommarns alla blommor. Nu surrar bin\, och fåglar sjunger överallt. Nu stryker vinden genom trädens höga kronor men i min trädgård är det visset\, mörkt och kallt. Här är det risigt och förvuxet\, fult och snårigt och lika hopplöst grått och trist som i mitt bröst. Därute doftar det av sommarns alla dofter. Där är det sommar\, men här inne är det höst.  Jag levde lycklig här med dig och mina katter ett liv i synd och utan omsorg att bli frälst. Försonad med min karaktär\, för jag har aldrig förmott att säga nej till någonting som helst. Och aldrig nekat mig det ena eller andra\, och levat livet\, tills jag krossades en dag. Det börja med att du bedrog mig med en annan\, en som du sa var mycket finare än jag.  Vårt gräl tog veckor\, ropen blandades med gråten och jag blev grundligt jämförd med din fina vän Tills du bekände att hon givit dig på båten Då blev det dödstyst här i trädgården igen! Ifrån den stunden var den kvinnan dubbelt hatad Hon hade lekt med dig\, med oss ett litet slag Och ja jag kände det som även jag var ratad Jag ville slåss\, och gick mot mitt livs nederlag  Jag kom med hammaren beredd under min kappa När hon kom ut i sidenpumps och sa: God dag! Kom in och slå dig ner en stund så får vi prata! Jag bara stammade\, nu minns jag inte vad... Och jag blev bjuden på likör och cigarriller och kunde inte få mig till att säga nej! Och när vi skiljdes var vi bästisar och bundis och jag tog saker som du glömt med hem till dig!  Jag går omkring i mitt pompej\, i bland ruiner och jag traskar runt i resterna utav vårt liv Men du skall aldrig ge mig pikar om sekiner och aldrig skall du bli en annans tidsfördriv! Nej\, åt det gamla skall vi binda vackra kransar och ta vårt liv och mina katter som de är. Och trots all kärleksbrist och trasighet och fransar Dig skall jag älska livet ut\, dig har jag kär!	0
COL title VAL Under the Milky Way COL performer VAL Micadelia	COL video title VAL Burl Ives ft Owen Bradley & Orchestra - A Holly Jolly Christmas (MCA Records 1965) COL channel name VAL ChristmasTimeTV COL description VAL "A Holly Jolly Christmas" is a popular song written by Johnny Marks.  Although he was Jewish\, he specialized in Christmas songs and wrote many standards including "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\," "I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day\," "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\, and "Run Rudolph Run."  This song was first recorded by the Quinto Sisters and later by Burl Ives.  The guitarist is Harold Ray Bradley\, the brother of the musical director Owen Bradley.  Burl Icle Ivanhoe Ives (June 14\, 1909 – April 14\, 1995) was an American singer and actor of stage\, screen\, radio and television.  He began as an itinerant singer and banjoist\, and launched his own radio show\, The Wayfaring Stranger\, which popularized traditional folk songs. In 1942 he appeared in Irving Berlin's This Is the Army\, and then became a major star of CBS radio. In the 1960s he successfully crossed over into country music\, recording hits such as "A Little Bitty Tear" and "Funny Way of Laughing". A popular film actor through the late 1940s and 1950s\, Ives's best-known roles in that medium included parts in So Dear to My Heart and Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\, as well as Rufus Hannassey in The Big Country\, for which he won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.  Ives is often remembered for his starring role in the 1964 Christmas stop-motion television special Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\, which continues to air on CBS every Christmas season\, as the voice of "Sam the Snowman"\, the special's host and narrator.  Have a holly\, jolly Christmas;  It's the best time of the year  I don't know if there'll be snow  but have a cup of cheer  Have a holly\, jolly Christmas;  And when you walk down the street  Say Hello to friends you know  and everyone you meet   Oh ho  the mistletoe  hung where you can see;  Somebody waits for you;  Kiss her once for me  Have a holly jolly Christmas  and in case you didn't hear  Oh by golly  have a holly  jolly Christmas this year	0

Their first release\, the April 1959 single "Rockin' Blues" b/w "Midnight Party"\, came out under the name The Del-Tones\, but the group changed their name soon afterward in a nod to the Bomarc missile. Their breakthrough hit was "Clap Your Hands"\, which hit #1 in Canada and Australia\,[1] and peaked at #45 on the US Billboard pop charts[2] and #40 on Cashbox.[3] The tune was also released in French as "Frappe Tes Mains". Their debut\, ten-track full-length came out in 1960; they appeared on American Bandstand and at a charity concert at Carnegie Hall soon afterward. Two more albums followed before the group broke up in 1963; a 1968 reunion saw "Clap Your Hands" get a re-release.	0

L'auteur de L'écume des jours a su trouver les mots qui sonnent avec grâce. La direction musicale de Laurent De Wild est un "Voyage au Paradis".  Libération -- 2009 -- Bruno Pfeiffer -- Diane chante Vian tel que -- Un météore a explosé la surface tranquille de la lune : son dernier disque "Docteur Boris et Mister Vian". Le travail enduit de baume les oreilles\, puis le reste de la carcasse. C'est tout simplement extra... Un régal. Vian n'aurait sans doute pas hésité à applaudir « Rue de la flemme ». Quel concentré de swing relâché! Quel modèle de grande chanson (tour de force de la traduction)! Pourquoi  citer seulement  le savoureux « Voyage au Paradis » ? Les onze valent le coup. Le disque passe comme un remède à l'imbécillité de la période actuelle... La profondeur légère de l'interprétation s'offre comme un cadeau. Les chorus de Laurent de Wilde\, huit ou seize mesures maxi\, ne goinfrent pas la mise en place. La complicité de l'ensemble se ressent du respect flagrant que se portent les artistes. Le prochain qui me classe Diane Tell dans la variété\, je l'enjoins : jazzons les idées préconçues.

Originally a French song by Margueritte Monnot entitled 'Le Goualante du Pauvre Jean' sung by Edith Piaf - roughly translated as 'The Popular Song of Poor John'. The music publisher mis-translated the French title into what we all know it as today - or so the story goes....... This particular disc actually reads 'Poor John' on the label. ---superb key change at 00.54.	0

Luca Santucci	COL video title VAL Woody Herman - A Taste of Honey COL channel name VAL Erlendur Svavarsson COL description VAL On that ghastly afternoon when John F. Kennedy died\, Woody Herman was recording an album for Phillips. The band was playing Bobby Scott's "A Taste of Honey". Everyone had heard the news and there was in that performance a mournfulness that is not in the arrangement\, not in the notes themselves\, but in the attitude in the band\, whose personnel at that period included Nat Pierce\, Sal Nistico\, Phil Wilson\, and Bill Chase. You can hear it in the recording. It is a striking track\, deeply sad\, and it shows how jazz can reflect public events and the consequent more immediately than any other art. Woody finished the take and cancelled the rest of the date.	0

A really wonderful lyric(see below) and gorgeous back up guitar by John Renbourn and Danny Thompson on bass  CHANGES by Phil Ochs  Sit by my side\, come as close as the air\, Share in a memory of grey; and wander in my words\,and dream about the pictures That I played of changes.  Green leaves of summer turn red in the fall To browns and to yellows they fade. And then they have to die\, trapped within the circle time parade of changes.  Scenes of my young years were warm in my mind\, Visions of shadows that shine. Til one day I returned and found they were the Victims of the vine of changes.  The world's spinning madly\, it drifts in the dark Swings through a hollow of haze\, A race around the stars\, a journey through The universe ablaze with changes.  Moments of magic will glow in the night All fears of the forest are gone But when the morning breaks they're swept away by golden drops of dawn\, of changes.  Passions will part to a strange melody. As fires will sometimes burn cold. Like petals in the wind\, we're puppets to the silver strings of souls\, of changes.  Your tears will be trembling\, now we're somewhere else\, One last glass of wine we will pour  I'll kiss you one more time\, and leave you on the rolling river shore of changes.	0

COL title VAL How Deep Is the Ocean (How High Is the Sky) COL performer VAL Ray Charles	COL video title VAL Roots of Blues -- The Mississippi Sheiks „Sitting On Top Of T COL channel name VAL Literatisch COL description VAL „Sitting On Top Of The World" (Hawks -- Jefferson - Simmons)  Recorded: no details available  The Mississippi Sheiks were a popular and influential guitar and fiddle group of the 1930s. They were notable mostly for playing country blues but were adept at many styles of United States popular music of the time\, and their records were bought by both black and white audiences. Country blues is often seen as being the domain of individual musicians\, a stereotype propagated by the way such delta blues performers as Robert Johnson and Charley Patton have entered the popular consciousness. Of the smaller number of groups playing at the time\, the Mississippi Sheiks are among the better known and most influential among their peers.  In 2004\, they were inducted in the Mississippi Musicians Hall of Fame. Their 1930 blues single "Sitting on Top of the World" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2008.  The Mississippi Sheiks consisted mainly of the Chatmon family\, who came from Bolton\, Mississippi and were well known throughout the Mississippi Delta; the father of the family had been a "musicianer" during times of black slavery\, and his children carried on the musical spirit. Their most famous (although by no means permanent) member was Armenter Chatmon - better known as Bo Carter - who managed a successful solo career as well as playing with the Sheiks\, which may have contributed to their success. The band named themselves after Rudolph Valentino's film The Sheik (1921).  When the band first recorded in 1930\, the line-up consisted of Carter with Lonnie and Sam Chatmon\, and Walter Vinson. Charlie McCoy (not to be confused with Charlie McCoy\, a later American musician) played later\, when Bo Carter and Sam Chatmon ceased playing full time. It was Lonnie Chatmon and Vinson who formed the real centre of the group.  Bo Carter's solo work is notable for being sexually suggestive in songs such as "My Pencil Won't Write No More" and this is carried on to an extent with the group; however\, like Carter himself the Mississippi Sheiks rarely used double entendres. They primarily earned their income like Robert Johnson and Skip James. They toured throughout the South of the U.S.\, but also reached as far north as Chicago and New York.  Their first and biggest success was "Sitting On Top Of The World" (1930)\, later to be recorded by Howlin' Wolf\, Nat King Cole\, Bill Monroe\, Bob Wills (numerous times)\, Harry Belafonte\, Frank Sinatra\, Bob Dylan\, the Grateful Dead and Jack White\, and re-done by Robert Johnson\, and called Come On in My Kitchen. Throughout their five active years\, the Mississippi Sheiks recorded over seventy songs for the Okeh\, Paramount and Bluebird labels.  When the band dissolved in 1935 the Chatmon brothers gave up music and returned to being farmers\, the most common occupation of black people in rural Mississippi.  The Sheiks and related groups under other names\, such as Mississippi Mud Steppers and Blacksnakes\, recorded about a hundred sides in the first half of the 1930s\, among them original compositions (probably by Vinson) like "The World is Going Wrong" and "I've Got Blood in My Eyes For You" (1931) - both recorded by Bob Dylan - or the topical "Sales Tax" (1934)	0

(Her album "Child of the Seventies" was recorded in 1972\, and was not released until 2006.)  It is such a treat to see that she is now widely appreciated and respected as a major singer.

It takes a great singer to really do justice to Dylan\, yet KT goes well beyond that and makes this her own. She's just that good live.  I work nights in a television studio and used to come home in the morning to find absolutely nothing interesting to watch on television. The last thing I wanted to see was more commercials. And I'm not really interested in watching talk shows and soap operas.  Then I discovered the commercial free music channel RAVE. HD quality video and pretty much perfect 5.1 sound. A few times a week they run "Later With Jools Holland" in the morning. Jools has great taste in music and each show runs the gamut from pop\, rock\, folk\, Celtic\, African\, to Joanna Newsome. Something for everyone. Suffice to say I love this show.  Uploaded as a high quality 640 x 480 MPEG4 file using Pinnacle Studio.

Sears' lyrics are most commonly set to one of two melodies: "Carol\," composed by Richard Storrs Willis\, or "Noel\," adapted from an English melody.  Ella's accompanied by Ralph Carmichael & Orchestra.  (Capitol Records)  It came upon the midnight clear\,  That glorious song of old\,  From angels bending near the earth  To touch their harps of gold! Peace on the earth\, good will to men\,  From heaven's all gracious King!  The world in solemn stillness lay  To hear the angels sing.   Still through the cloven skies they come  With peaceful wings unfurled  And still their heavenly music floats  O'er all the weary world;  Above its sad and lowly plains  They bend on hovering wing.  And ever o'er its Babel sounds  The blessed angels sing.  Yet with te woes of sin and strife  The world hath suffered long;  Beneath the angel-strain have rolled  Two thousand years of wrong;  And man\, at war with man\, hears not  The love song which they bring:  O hush the noise\, ye men of strife\,  And hear the angels sing.   For lo! the days are hastening on\,  By prophet bards foretold\,  When\, with the ever-circling years\,  Shall come the Age of Gold;  When peace shall over all the earth  Its ancient splendors fling\,  And all the world give back the song  Which now the angels sing.	0

COL title VAL Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas COL performer VAL Megan Nicole	COL video title VAL The Carpenters - Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas (A&M Records 1978) COL channel name VAL ChristmasTimeTV COL description VAL "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" is a song introduced by Judy Garland in the 1944 MGM musical Meet Me in St. Louis. Frank Sinatra later recorded a version with modified lyrics\, which has become more common than the original. The song was written by Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane.  When presented with the original draft lyric\, Garland\, her co-star Tom Drake and director Vincente Minnelli criticized the song as depressing\, and asked Martin to change the lyrics. Though he initially resisted\, Martin made several changes to make the song more upbeat. For example\, the lines "It may be your last / Next year we may all be living in the past" became "Let your heart be light / Next year all our troubles will be out of sight". Garland's version of the song\, which was also released as a single by Decca Records\, became popular among United States troops serving in World War II; her performance at the Hollywood Canteen brought many soldiers to tears.  In 1957\, Frank Sinatra asked Martin to revise the line "Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow". He told Martin\, "The name of my album is A Jolly Christmas. Do you think you could jolly up that line for me?" Martin's new line was "Hang a shining star upon the highest bough". Martin made several other alterations\, changing the song's focus to a celebration of present happiness\, rather than anticipation of a better future. On The Judy Garland Show Christmas Special\, Judy sings the song to her children Joey and Lorna Luft with Sinatra's alternate lyrics.  Have yourself a merry little Christmas  Let your heart be light  From now on  our troubles will be out of sight  Have yourself a merry little Christmas  Make the Yule-tide gay  From now on  our troubles will be miles away   Here were are as in olden days  happy golden days of yore  Faithful friends who are dear to us  gather near to us once more   Through the years we all will be together  If the Fates allow  Hang a shining star upon the highest bough  And have yourself a merry little Christmas now	1

COL title VAL It Ain't Me Babe COL performer VAL Peter\, Paul & Mary	COL video title VAL Vera Lynn - We'll Meet Again (1939 Novachord Version) COL channel name VAL Travis Bickle COL description VAL Thanks to Kim Damien Eriksen for pointing out (in his very informative comment) that in fact this is a '39 version of the song\, and thanks to Aidan The Lover Boy O'Dwyer too for reminding me to check the comments. "We'll Meet Again" is song made famous by British singer Vera Lynn with music and lyrics written by Ross Parker and Hughie Charles (born Charles Hugh Owen Ferry\, 24 Jul 1907 in Reddish\, Stockport\, Cheshire). The song is one of the most famous songs of the Second World War era\, and resonated with soldiers going off to fight and their families and sweethearts. The assertion that "we'll meet again" is optimistic\, as many soldiers did not survive to see their loved ones again. Indeed\, the meeting place at some unspecified time in the future would have been seen by many who lost loved ones to be heaven.	0

COL title VAL Hey Joe COL performer VAL Group Therapy	COL video title VAL Glen Campbell - The Christmas Song (Merry Christmas To You) Capitol Records 1968 COL channel name VAL ChristmasTimeTV COL description VAL "The Christmas Song" (commonly subtitled "Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire" or\, as it was originally subtitled\, "Merry Christmas to You") is a classic Christmas song written in 1944 by musician\, composer\, and vocalist Mel Tormé and Bob Wells. According to Tormé\, the song was written during a blistering hot summer. In an effort to "stay cool by thinking cool\," the most-performed (according to BMI) Christmas song was born. The Nat King Cole Trio first recorded the song early in 1946. At Cole's behest — and over the objections of his label\, Capitol Records — a second recording was made the same year utilizing a small string section\, this version becoming a massive hit on both the pop and R&B charts. Cole again recorded the song in 1953\, using the same arrangement with a full orchestra arranged and conducted by Nelson Riddle\, and once more in 1961\, in a stereophonic version with orchestra conducted by Ralph Carmichael. Nat King Cole's 1961 version is generally regarded as definitive\, and in 2004 was the most loved seasonal song with women aged 30--49\, while Cole's original 1946 recording was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1974.   Chestnuts roasting on an open fire  Jack Frost nipping at your nose  Yuletide carols being sung by a choir  And folks dressed up like Eskimos   Everybody knows a turkey and some  Mistletoe help to make the season bright  Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow  Will find it hard to sleep tonight   They know that Santa's on his way  He's loaded lots of toys and goodies  On his sleigh  And every mother's  Child is gonna spy to see if  Reindeer really know how to fly   And so\, I'm offering this  Simple phrase to kids from  One to ninety-two  Altho' it's been said many times  Many ways  "Merry Christmas to you"	0

In one of the most simple\, but very jazz interpretation of the song "Tea For Two" from her 1997 CD entitle"When the Wind Was Cool".  ESPAÑOL PARA LOS QUE NO ENTIENDEN: Una actuación muy especial por uno de mis bajistas europeo favoritos\, Ira Coleman y la voz única de una extraordinario cantante de Nueva Inglaterra de nombre Dominique Eade. En una de la interpretación más simple\, pero muy jazziada de la canción "Tea For Two"\, de su CD "cuando el viento era fresco"." When The Wind Was Cool".  MORE ABOUT DOMINIQUE EADE: http://www.dominiqueeade.com/biography.html  MORE ABOUT IRA COLEMAN: World Musician Ira Coleman was born in Stockholm\, Sweden. Raised in Southern France\, Ira thereafter lived in Germany for fourteen years. While in Germany\, Ira Coleman studied double bass at Cologne's "Hochschule für Musik" and subsequently came a move to the US to attend Berklee College of Music in Boston. "I have very strong ties to Europe\," says Ira who is fluent in French and German. "My mother was Swedish and a famous silversmith and designer\, and my father was a painter and graphic artist from Baltimore. The place to go was Paris. My parents met many expatriate artists\, writers and musicians." Among visitors to Ira's childhood home were Louis Armstrong\, Billie Holiday\, Ray Charles\, Charlie Mingus and Chester Himes. Ira got his inspiration at an early age\, though he didn't actually pick up a bass until he was 19 years old. "The bass fits my character\," says Ira\, who graduated from Berklee College of Music in 1985. "In most musical genres the bass is the pivotal center piece\, the instrument which provides a discrete and clear foundation\, and I enjoy the many challenges its function poses." Ira's resumé tells the story. Over the years\, Ira has worked with such well-known figures as Cab Calloway\, Freddie Hubbard\, Betty Carter\, Branford Marsalis\, Herbie Hancock\, Wayne Shorter\, Jessye Norman and Sting. He was musical director for vocalist Dee Dee Bridgewater and toured with her internationally from 2002 until 2009. One night he's on the stage at Carnegie Hall playing in a tribute to African-American culture. The next morning he is on a plane to Europe to collaborate on a recording or heading to Japan for a jazz festival. As comfortable playing Jamaican rhythms as he is accompanying a gospel choir or performing in a Jazz trio\, this professional bass player has built an international reputation for versatility.	0

One of Ray's best records\, in my opinion. What is incredible is that it didn't chart nationally in Billboard in the US\, although it was a hit in Australia and the UK. At this point\, Johnnie's last previous big success on the US charts had been in 1954\, but he was to make a major US comeback with "Just Walking in the Rain" later in 1956. It should be mentioned that "Ain't Misbehavin" DID chart in Milwaukee\, Wisconsin. Charted at #17 on UK Singles chart in April 1956.  Many versions of this song have charted over the years: #2 in the US for Leo Reisman and His Orchestra in 1929\, #7 for Louis Armstrong in 1929\, #9 for Gene Austin in 1929\, #16 for Ruth Etting in 1929\, #17 for Fats Waller in 1929\, #6 for Teddy Wilson & His Orchestra in 1937\, #6 for Dinah Washington on the R&B chart in 1948\, #3 in the UK for Tommy Bruce & the Bruisers in May 1960 and #1 on the US Country chart for Hank Williams Jr. in 1986.   Written by Fats Waller\, Harry Brooks & Andy Razaf.   B-side is "Walk Along With Kings".	0

Wir brauchten früher keine große Reise. Wie wurden braun auf Borkum und auf Sylt. Doch heute sind die Braunen nur noch Weiße. Denn hier wird man ja doch nur tiefgekühlt.  Ja früher gab's noch Hitzefrei. Das Freibad war schon auf im Mai. Ich saß bis in die Nacht vor unserem Haus. Da hatten wir noch Sonnenbrand und Riesenquallen an dem Strand\, und Eis und jeder Schutzmann zog die Jacke aus.  Wann wird's mal wieder richtig Sommer -  ein Sommer wie er früher einmal war? Ja mit Sonnenschein von Juni bis September und nicht so naß und so sibirisch wie im letzten Jahr.  Na na na ... la la la ...  Und was wir da für Hitzewellen hatten Pulloverfabrikanten gingen ein. Da gab es bis zu 40 Grad im Schatten Wir mußten mit dem Wasser sparsam sein.  Die Sonne knallte ins Gesicht da brauchte man die Sauna nicht. Ein Schaf war damals froh wenn man es schor Es war hier wie in Afrika Wer durfte machte FKK Doch heut\, heut summen alle Mücken laut im Chor  Wann wird's mal wieder richtig Sommer -  ein Sommer wie er früher einmal war?

COL title VAL Cute COL performer VAL Bob Mintzer Big Band	COL video title VAL George E. Lee's Novelty Singing Orch. - St James Infirmary COL channel name VAL 240252 COL description VAL From Wikipedia:  St James Infirmary -- American folksong\, made famous by Louis Armstrong recording from 1928. (Many records credit it to Joe Primrose\, which is a pseudonim of Irving Mills - agent and songwriter\, probably an autor of an original arrangement).  George E. Lee Singing Novelty Orchestra steadily grew in number and sophistication throughout all the 1920s. George and his sister Julia's showmanship and strong vocals made the band a hit with the audiences in the 18th and Vine area. In August\, 1923\, the six-piece Lee band recorded for the OKeh label\, becoming the first African American band from Kansas City to record. Unfortunately\, Okeh judged the result of the session unsatisfactory and declined to release the two selections\, "Just Wait Until I'm gone" and "Waco Blues." Having missed an opportunity for national exposure\, the Lee band continued playing the dance halls and cabarets in the 18th and Vine community.  In November\, 1929\, the Lee band recorded six selections for the Brunswick label\, including "St James Infirmary." Louis Armstrong had recorded an up-tempo version of "Saint James Infirmary" a year earlier\, but it failed to catch on with the record-buying public. Lee's slower-tempo version better matched the solemn lyrics describing a gambler meditating on his own mortality while viewing his dead sweetheart's body in Saint James Infirmary. The record sold well locally\, but Brunswick did not promote it nationally in the advent of the Great Depression. Cab Calloway's cover of Lee's version of "Saint James Infirmary\," recorded the next year\, created a national sensation.    Recording: George E. Lee & His Novelty Singing Orch.\, voc. George E.

The music was written by Vincent Rose\, the lyrics by [John L. Rooney]. It was recorded six times in 1940. Victor Records released the recording by the Sammy Kaye Orchestra with vocals by Tommy Ryan on May 31\, 1940 (catalog #26643\, with the flip side "Maybe"; matrix #51050). Gene Krupa's version was issued on the Okeh label (#5672) on June 3. Other 1940 recordings were by: Glenn Miller on Bluebird (10768)\, Kay Kyser\, Russ Morgan\, Gene Autry (also in the 1941 film The Singing Hill)\, Connee Boswell\, and Jimmy Dorsey. The largest 1940 hit was by Glenn Miller.  Louis Armstrong's 1949 recording charted in the Billboard Top 40. It was an international hit in 1956 for Fats Domino\, and has become a rock and roll standard. It reached number two\, for three weeks on the Billboard Top 40 charts\, becoming his biggest pop hit\, and spent eight non-consecutive weeks at number one on the R&B Best Sellers chart. The version by Fats Domino was also ranked #81 in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. The song was Domino's greatest hit and remains the song most associated with him.

(the first line of Domino's 1950s version of "Blueberry Hill") in reference to pretty girls he dated or wanted to date.  It is one of the songs that the time traveling James Cole enjoys in the film\, Twelve Monkeys\, and the song is later sung by the scientists upon his return to the future.  The song is purportedly named after a "make-out" spot in Taos\, New Mexico.  Joe Edwards' restaurant on the Delmar Loop in St. Louis\, Missouri\, where Chuck Berry frequently plays\, is named after the song.  The Far Side\, a comic written by Gary Larson\, features a comic parodying the lyrics of this song. A man is talking in a phone booth on top of a hill named "Blueberry Hill." He says into the phone "Norm? This is Mitch. ... You were right--I found my drill." The parody is of the line "found my thrill on Blueberry Hill."  Prime Minister of Russia Vladimir Putin made a cover performance of the song on December 10\, 2010 before an audience of international film and television celebrities\, in support of a charity for ill children. Videos of his performance quickly went viral worldwide.	0

COL title VAL In a Sentimental Mood COL performer VAL John Stubblefield	COL video title VAL "I just wanna make love to you" from Carmen's new Studio Master on the Sound Liaison label COL channel name VAL Carmen Gomes inc. COL description VAL Hi-res: http://www.soundliaison.com/   CD: https://carmengomes.bandcamp.com/   http://www.carmengomes.com/ ''Her style is bluesy and intimate with a sexy voice that's sweet as dark tupelo honey\, and her interpretations are unerring. this intimate effort is one of the best and best-sounding jazz vocal albums to come along in many a day.'' "I've seldom heard recordings that were so successful in both performance and sound aspects.'' quotes from Rad Bennett's review in the audiophile SoundStage! Magazine. Check out Carmen's new audiophile Studio Master Download  from the Sound Liaison label'.http://www.soundliaison.com/ Format: 24-bit/96kHz WAW(download) I've been among the prophets saying that high-resolution downloads are the future of audiophile music sales. Surely it will benefit the majors to make high-quality downloads a first choice rather than an MP3 extra\, but I believe that individual artists can benefit as well. Most new-to-the-scene performers have little money for middlemen and disc manufacture\, yet can get things together for the Internet.  Frans de Rond and Peter Bjørnild have taken this approach with Sound Liaison\, producing recordings available only in 24-bit/96kHz downloads that mirror the master recording. And man\, are they ever sweet. I've seldom heard recordings that were so successful in both performance and sound aspects.  De Rond hails from the Netherlands\, where he studied double bass at The Royal Conservatory in The Hague while concurrently studying recording techniques. Bjørnild also studied double bass\, moving to the Netherlands to continue studies at The Hague. Since graduating\, he has played almost every type of music\, from classical to jazz. Together de Rond and Bjørnild bring two pairs of golden ears to their label. Bjørnild claims that\, "a recording should be as realistic and beautiful sounding as possible. As if\, when closing your eyes\, you find yourself in the best seat in the hall."  The partners discovered a fine recording hall (Studio-Eleven\, Hilversum) and set out to record amazing musicians in this great acoustic place in front of live audiences. It's a daring feat; one take and no place to hide\, but the abilities of the musicians involved make it seem easy. I chose to talk about the first album by Carmen Gomes Inc. It was a tough choice because all of the three current albums were worthy of review.  Carmen Gomes has won many awards in the Netherlands and surrounding areas. Like so many new European singers\, she sings in English -- excellent English\, I might add. She's formed a group called Carmen Gomes Inc.\, with Folker Tettero on guitar\, Peter Bjørnild on double bass\, and Marcel van Engelen on drums. Her style is bluesy and intimate with a sexy voice that's sweet as dark tupelo honey\, and her interpretations are unerring. The musicians play to her and to each other\, and the ensemble is so tight that the four musicians breathe and move as one.  There are some standards on the set that knocked me over with their fresh approach. Any singer can misplace a few accents and rhythms and come up with something that's original\, but perhaps also uneasy and a little strange. Not Gomes\, who has taken the songs to their bones and then restructured them to suit her style. Thus "Fever" doesn't sound like a cover of Peggy Lee; it sounds like a brand new take on a familiar song. You emerge from hearing it not thinking it's better or lesser than Lee's version\, but that it's a valid new interpretation that could have come first.  The same approach works on "Angel Eyes\," "You Don't Know What Love Is\," and "I'm on Fire." Most of the rest\, including the title song\, "Oblivion\," "Time Will Tell\," "Gasoa Blue\," and "The Sea\," are Gomes originals that fit right in with the standards. The recording achieves exactly what Bjørnild set out as his goal. It can provide the best seat in your listening room. Go to the Sound Liaison site\, listen to a few samples\, download an album\, and see if you don't agree that this intimate effort is one of the best and best-sounding jazz vocal albums to come along in many a day. By the way\, the small audience applauds enthusiastically enough after the last chords of a song die away\, but the attendees never interrupt or make themselves known while a song is going on. No doubt they were completely mesmerized into silence\, as was I.  Be sure to listen to: On "Dock of the Bay\," Gomes creates a languid\, bluesy version that is a little bit reminiscent of Bobbie Gentry while still coming across as quite original. It'll cast a spell over you.  . . . Rad Bennett radb@soundstagenetwork.comradb@soundstagenetwork.com	0

The song was a Top Ten hit around the world\, ranking #1 on Rolling Stone Magazine's dance chart for six weeks that summer. "Peter Gunn" won the Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental of 1986. It also gave Eddy the distinction of being the only instrumentalist to have had Top 10 hit singles in four different decades in Great Britain.  Peter Gunn is an American private eye television series which aired on the NBC (produced by Revue Productions) and later ABC (produced by MGM Television) television networks from 1958 to 1961. The show's creator (and also writer and director on occasion) was Blake Edwards. Also directed by Robert Altman\, a total of 114 thirty-minute episodes were produced.	0

(Her album "Child of the Seventies" was recorded in 1972\, and was not released until 2006.)  It is such a treat to see that she is now widely appreciated and respected as a major singer.  It only took her four decades! I highly recommend her albums\, from every decade.	0

A really wonderful lyric(see below) and gorgeous back up guitar by John Renbourn and Danny Thompson on bass  CHANGES by Phil Ochs  Sit by my side\, come as close as the air\, Share in a memory of grey; and wander in my words\,and dream about the pictures That I played of changes.  Green leaves of summer turn red in the fall To browns and to yellows they fade. And then they have to die\, trapped within the circle time parade of changes.  Scenes of my young years were warm in my mind\, Visions of shadows that shine. Til one day I returned and found they were the Victims of the vine of changes.  The world's spinning madly\, it drifts in the dark Swings through a hollow of haze\, A race around the stars\, a journey through The universe ablaze with changes.  Moments of magic will glow in the night All fears of the forest are gone But when the morning breaks they're swept away by golden drops of dawn\, of changes.  Passions will part to a strange melody. As fires will sometimes burn cold. Like petals in the wind\, we're puppets to the silver strings of souls\, of changes.  Your tears will be trembling\, now we're somewhere else\, One last glass of wine we will pour  I'll kiss you one more time\, and leave you on the rolling river shore of changes.	0

Es que desde hace mucho tiempo solo teníamos de este grupo una pequeña foto borrosa y una reseña en inglés que subió George Bonilla al sitio http://www.incarock.com. Yo nunca los había escuchado.  En 1964\, Diego García Sayán\, los hermanos José y Freddy Rizo Patrón\, Ramón Orbegoso y Felipe Larrabure\, formaron Los Hang Tens (1964-1968). Ellos eran compañeros de estudios del colegio Santa María en el distrito San Isidro. "Una banda que se formó sin la pretensión de convertirse en grupo profesional\, pues el principal propósito era reunirse para disfrutar de la música y entretener a sus amigos en fiestas y funciones escolares"\, dice Bonilla. Según esta misma referencia\, ellos (como ya muchos en el mundo) habían caído bajo el influjo de la llamada "invasión británica": Beatles\, Rolling Stones\, Kinks\, Yarbirds\, Dave Clark Five\, Animals\, Herman Hermits\, etc. También participaron en el grupo Manuel Sanguinetti\, Juan de Aliaga\, Jaime Sabal y Guillermo Pérez Argüello\, remplazando o alternándose con los fundadores. La popularidad del grupo atrajo la atención del sello Odeon\, que les propuso grabar un 45 rpm\, que ahora se ha convertido en pieza de colección: "Till the end of the day" (del grupo The Kinks) en el lado A y "These boots were made for walking" (que popularizara Nancy Sinatra) en el lado B. El disco salió en 1966. En 1967\, los hermanos Rizo Patrón y Manuel Sanguinetti ya planeaban crear un grupo de mayores proyecciones: Traffic Sound. Pero esa ya es otra historia (y qué historia).	0

Naturally\, they were required to run through as many takes of each song as was necessary to satisfy the exacting demands of their mentors. Luckily for us\, many of these alternate takes have survived. Mono was the standard recording format until the late 1960s\, but many of the big selling artists also recorded alternate versions specifically for the stereo market\, which was targeted to the discerning adult listener.     Disc One features all the alternate stereo versions of Coasters songs that were issued at the time on album and subsequently on CD. Disc Two takes you deep into the heart of Coasters sessions with composite tracks which combine studio chatter together with the finest moments from various different takes. This disc contains several outtakes which have until now been unavailable anywhere and gives an invaluable insight into the genesis of many well-loved tracks and also into the character and working practice of the Coasters and of their producers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller.     The accompanying 24-page booklet includes many rare photos and an exhaustive session discography by Claus Röhnisch. A collection for Coasters and early rock 'n' roll aficionados!	0

Everyone had heard the news and there was in that performance a mournfulness that is not in the arrangement\, not in the notes themselves\, but in the attitude in the band\, whose personnel at that period included Nat Pierce\, Sal Nistico\, Phil Wilson\, and Bill Chase. You can hear it in the recording. It is a striking track\, deeply sad\, and it shows how jazz can reflect public events and the consequent more immediately than any other art.

It takes a great singer to really do justice to Dylan\, yet KT goes well beyond that and makes this her own. She's just that good live.  I work nights in a television studio and used to come home in the morning to find absolutely nothing interesting to watch on television. The last thing I wanted to see was more commercials. And I'm not really interested in watching talk shows and soap operas.  Then I discovered the commercial free music channel RAVE. HD quality video and pretty much perfect 5.1 sound. A few times a week they run "Later With Jools Holland" in the morning. Jools has great taste in music and each show runs the gamut from pop\, rock\, folk\, Celtic\, African\, to Joanna Newsome. Something for everyone. Suffice to say I love this show.  Uploaded as a high quality 640 x 480 MPEG4 file using Pinnacle Studio.

In December of 2012\, he laid down tracks with two of his idols—the legendary Ron Carter and the estimable Kenny Barron—and dubbed their group the Thrasher Dream Trio. The eponymous debut from that band\, featuring fifteen tracks recorded at those sessions\, was\, not surprisingly\, a strong and classy affair filled with standards\, some originals\, and other jazz-friendly fare\, such as Stevie Wonder's "Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing" and Burt Bacharach's "Promises\, Promises."   At the time of that album's release\, those last-mentioned tracks could simply be viewed as part of the well-rounded program. But looking back now\, it actually seems like they were dropped as hints of what was to come. About a year-and-a-half after that first Thrasher Dream Trio album was recorded\, Gibbs brought the band together again to lay things down for We're Back (Whaling City Sound\, 2014)\, a jazz-does-R&B project with A-list guests—vibraphonist Warren Wolf\, saxophonist Steve Wilson\, and organist Larry Goldings. That album offered multiple helpings of Wonder and Earth\, Wind & Fire along with single servings of Bacharach\, Marvin Gaye\, Miles Davis\, and the Average White Band. As on the trio's first album\, the sparks were flying. The playing field\, however\, had changed a bit.   For this\, the third go-around for this group\, Gibbs does it again\, tweaking the formula without altering the essence of the trio. This time he turned the focus toward pop-ish material from the '50s and '60s—the work of Bacharach\, Henry Mancini\, Michel Legrand\, and others of that ilk—and put an audience in front of the band\, recording live at Systems Two Recording Studio. Guests are part of the package again—now it's trumpeter Roy Hargrove and vocalist Cassandra Wilson\, each appearing on a few tracks—and they help to add another wrinkle or two to the project without drawing focus away from the trio.   The album opens on a fluid "Wives And Lovers" that allows Barron's lyricism to shine through\, gives Carter a chance to step into the spotlight\, and puts Gibbs' brushwork at center stage. From there\, the trio moves on with an unusually upbeat take on "The Summer Knows\," a Wilson-enhanced version of "The Look Of Love" that moves from bossa nova to swing\, and a variety of other familiar hits of yesteryear. Hargrove joins in for "On A Clear Day\," quoting Ellington at one point and playfully trading solos with Gibbs; Vince Guaraldi's cheerfulness shines through on a perky trio performance of his "Cast Your Fate To The Wind"; "More" is transformed from a stale confection into an enjoyable swinger; and "Watch What Happens" happens twice—first as a cheerful\, Brazilian-based instrumental\, then as a swing-centered feature for Wilson.   Along the way there are plenty of other bright spots—an appropriately noir-ish "What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life?" with Hargrove on flugelhorn\, a leisurely stroll through "Girl Talk"—and plenty of moments that serve as simple reminders as to why Barron and Carter are loved\, respected\, and emulated the world over. Their time and taste are impeccable\, and when married to Gibbs' in-the-tradition drumming\, you know the music is going to go in the right direction every time.

COL title VAL Throw It Away COL performer VAL Laïka Fatien	COL video title VAL Ella Fitzgerald ft Ralph Carmichael & Orchestra - It Came Upon A Midnight Clear (Capitol Rec 1967) COL channel name VAL ChristmasTimeTV COL description VAL "It Came Upon a Midnight Clear" (sometimes rendered as "It Came Upon a Midnight Clear") is a poem and Christmas carol written by Edmund Sears\, pastor of the Unitarian Church in Lancaster\, Massachusetts. Sears' lyrics are most commonly set to one of two melodies: "Carol\," composed by Richard Storrs Willis\, or "Noel\," adapted from an English melody.  Ella's accompanied by Ralph Carmichael & Orchestra.  (Capitol Records)  It came upon the midnight clear\,  That glorious song of old\,  From angels bending near the earth  To touch their harps of gold! Peace on the earth\, good will to men\,  From heaven's all gracious King!  The world in solemn stillness lay  To hear the angels sing.   Still through the cloven skies they come  With peaceful wings unfurled  And still their heavenly music floats  O'er all the weary world;  Above its sad and lowly plains  They bend on hovering wing.  And ever o'er its Babel sounds  The blessed angels sing.  Yet with te woes of sin and strife  The world hath suffered long;  Beneath the angel-strain have rolled  Two thousand years of wrong;  And man\, at war with man\, hears not  The love song which they bring:  O hush the noise\, ye men of strife\,  And hear the angels sing.   For lo! the days are hastening on\,  By prophet bards foretold\,  When\, with the ever-circling years\,  Shall come the Age of Gold;  When peace shall over all the earth  Its ancient splendors fling\,  And all the world give back the song  Which now the angels sing.	0

COL title VAL Comin' Home Baby COL performer VAL Harrison Craig	COL video title VAL Perez Prado - Guaglione (1958) COL channel name VAL Moraito COL description VAL Perez Prado (1958) Guaglione is a Neapolitan song with music by Giuseppe Fanciulli and words by Nicola "Nisa" Salerno. It was the winning song at the IV Napoli Song Festival broadcast by radio in 1956. The song's title means simply "boy" in Neapolitan language but as slang translates to "street bum"\, "urchin"\, "back street boy"\, "corner boy" or "street tough". The word guaglione has appeared as "wallyo" in New York immigrant slang. The song has been covered by various artists\, including Italian bandleader Renzo Arbore\, and Italian singers Claudio Villa\, Aurelio Fierro and Renato Carosone. Under the title "The Man Who Plays the Mandolino"\, with a lyric in English\, Dean Martin sang it in 1956 after Fred Raphael of Walt Disney Music Company obtained for Disney the U.S. publishing rights. The best known version of "Guaglione" was recorded by the Cuban bandleader Perez Prado in 1958 as an uptempo mambo tune. As a mambo\, the track rose to fame in 1995 after it was used for the Guinness advert "Anticipation". It has since been featured as the intro music for the 1996 video game Kingdom O' Magic\, and more recently as the opening music for the television showJimmy's Farm. The song is one of Disney's biggest profit makers. Written by G. Fanciulli &\, Nisa and produced by Herman Diaz\, Jr. All music or related performances remain the sole property of their respective copyright holders.

Sears' lyrics are most commonly set to one of two melodies: "Carol\," composed by Richard Storrs Willis\, or "Noel\," adapted from an English melody.  Ella's accompanied by Ralph Carmichael & Orchestra.  (Capitol Records)  It came upon the midnight clear\,  That glorious song of old\,  From angels bending near the earth  To touch their harps of gold! Peace on the earth\, good will to men\,  From heaven's all gracious King!  The world in solemn stillness lay  To hear the angels sing.   Still through the cloven skies they come  With peaceful wings unfurled  And still their heavenly music floats  O'er all the weary world;  Above its sad and lowly plains  They bend on hovering wing.  And ever o'er its Babel sounds  The blessed angels sing.  Yet with te woes of sin and strife  The world hath suffered long;  Beneath the angel-strain have rolled  Two thousand years of wrong;  And man\, at war with man\, hears not  The love song which they bring:  O hush the noise\, ye men of strife\,  And hear the angels sing.   For lo! the days are hastening on\,  By prophet bards foretold\,  When\, with the ever-circling years\,  Shall come the Age of Gold;  When peace shall over all the earth  Its ancient splendors fling\,  And all the world give back the song  Which now the angels sing.	0

COL title VAL Ruby Baby COL performer VAL Ronnie Hawkins and The Hawks	COL video title VAL Eydie Gorme   Round Midnight COL channel name VAL ifcopod COL description VAL Don't tell anyone  I'd probably prefer this Gorme  performance to any by Billie Holiday.though I have a sneaking affection for the soupy strings added by Our Man on Broadway  Ray Ellis to   Billie's two late albums. Billie was vaunted for her assimilation of  jazz instrumentalists in effect using her voice  plus vibrato  like a jazz soloist. Edyie Gorme and  husband Steve Lawrence  had stellar careers as popular song stylists backed by Don Costa  Orchestra when she recorded   in the 1950s for ABC Paramount. Their careers crossed  as well as threading  solo   paths..OK point taken Gorme is not a tragedienne as Holiday was  but then some are not overly flexed about tragedy in music. However the punch line in this   special  performance   comes  at the close of a wonderful vibrato laden styling. Edyie  underlining that singers of   this calibre just aint around  She  really  caps the proceedings with an amazingly held  smoky   closing note seems wonderfully to go on   and on  and on ~ sadly  interrupted by the  head honchos    monitoring  the recording  What a gang of philistines.. .One of the best  endings  you'll hear  from any singer  Gorme's interpretation worth it for this  alone.	0

Berry Gordy\, along with Gil Askey\, teamed up to record an album for the Supremes singing the Rodgers & Hart songbook and for it to coincide with the airing of the TV special. The girls recorded over 26 songs with Motown planning to release the album as a 2-LP set. However it was cut down to just 12 songs with the other 14 recordings remaining in the Motown vaults until the 1980's. "The Supremes Sing Rodgers & Hart" was released in May 1967 to critical acclaim. Ranging from big band to jazz to the modern sounds of Motown\, the album proved the Supremes could sing anything. It was versatility at its finest.   Written by: Richard Rodgers & Lorenz Hart Produced by: Berry Gordy & Gil Askey Arrangement by: Gil Askey Track recorded in LA: date unknown Vocals recorded: November 1966	0

COL title VAL 1-2-3 COL performer VAL Richard "Groove" Holmes	COL video title VAL Mildred Bailey - I Don't Stand A Ghost Of A Chance With You - 1939 COL channel name VAL warholsoup100 COL description VAL Vintage Radio Slideshow. Mildred Bailey (February 27\, 1907 -- December 12\, 1951) was a popular and influential American jazz singer during the 1930s\, known as "The Rockin' Chair Lady" and "Mrs. Swing". Her number one hits were "Please Be Kind"\, "Darn That Dream"\, "Rockin' Chair" and "Says My Heart". In the mid 1930s\, she recorded with her third husband Red Norvo. A dynamic couple\, they earned the nicknames "Mr. and Mrs. Swing". During this period (1936--1939) Norvo recorded for Brunswick (with Bailey as primary vocalist) and Bailey recorded her own set of recordings for Vocalion\, often with Norvo's band. Some of her recordings instead featured members of Count Basie's band. Despite her divorce from Norvo\, she and Red would continue to record together until 1945. Suffering from diabetes and depression (during her adult life Bailey was overweight)\, she only made a few recordings following World War II.  Mildred Bailey died December 12\, 1951\, in Poughkeepsie\, New York\, of heart failure\, aged 44\, chiefly due to her diabetes. Her ashes were scattered. Red Norvo outlived Bailey by nearly half a century\, dying in April 1999\, a week after his 91st birthday. "I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You" is a 1932 song composed by Victor Young\, with lyrics written by Ned Washington and Bing Crosby\, recorded on October 14\, 1932 by Bing Crosby in New York. In 1939\, Mildred Bailey fronted a six-side\, mostly blues session as "Mildred Bailey and her Oxford Greys" for Vocalion\, which featured a small mixed-race combo of Mary Lou Williams (piano)\, Floyd Smith (electric guitar)\, John Williams (bass) and Eddie Dougherty (drums).	0

COL title VAL A Taste of Honey COL performer VAL Les & Larry Elgart	COL video title VAL The Beatles - A Taste Of Honey COL channel name VAL DeutschMatheLehrer COL description VAL The Beatles - A Taste Of Honey (Copyright 1963 EMI Records)  "A Taste of Honey" is a pop standard written by Bobby Scott and Ric Marlow. It was originally an instrumental track (or recurring theme) written for the 1960 Broadway version of the 1958 British play A Taste of Honey (which was also made into a film with the same name in 1961). Both the original and a cover by Herb Alpert in 1965 earned the song Grammy Awards. A vocal version of the song\, first recorded by Lenny Welch\, became popular when it was recorded by The Beatles in 1963.  The original recorded versions of the song ("A Taste of Honey"\, "A Taste of Honey (refrain)" and "A Taste of Honey (closing theme)" appeared on Bobby Scott's 1960 album\, also titled A Taste of Honey\, on Atlantic Records (Atlantic 1355). After being used in the film\, the composition won Best Instrumental Theme at the Grammy Awards of 1962.  Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass recorded the most popular instrumental version of this song with a cover on their 1965 album\, Whipped Cream & Other Delights. This recording spent five weeks at #1 on the adult contemporary chart\, reached #7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart\, and won three awards including Record of the Year at the Grammy Awards of 1966.  Martin Denny and The Victor Feldman Quartet each scored minor hits in 1962 with their covers.  Acker Bilk released a version in the UK in January 1963\, reaching #16 in the UK Singles Chart.  Paul Desmond recorded it on his album Glad to be Unhappy in 1963.  Lenny Welch recorded the first vocal version. It was released as a single in September 1962 on the Cadence label and included on his 1963 album Since I Fell for You. This version also credits Lee Morris as a writer but it is not known if it was he who provided the lyrics. This credit does not appear on any covers of the song\, with only Marlow/Scott credited.  Allan Sherman recorded a parody version called "A Waste of Money".   In other news\, I have added the lyrics to this song so you can sing along\, or perhaps learn the song! This is how I learned my first Beatles song! Enjoy! :)  Album: Introducing The Beatles Recorded: February 11\, 1963	1

They were notable mostly for playing country blues but were adept at many styles of United States popular music of the time\, and their records were bought by both black and white audiences. Country blues is often seen as being the domain of individual musicians\, a stereotype propagated by the way such delta blues performers as Robert Johnson and Charley Patton have entered the popular consciousness. Of the smaller number of groups playing at the time\, the Mississippi Sheiks are among the better known and most influential among their peers.  In 2004\, they were inducted in the Mississippi Musicians Hall of Fame. Their 1930 blues single "Sitting on Top of the World" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2008.  The Mississippi Sheiks consisted mainly of the Chatmon family\, who came from Bolton\, Mississippi and were well known throughout the Mississippi Delta; the father of the family had been a "musicianer" during times of black slavery\, and his children carried on the musical spirit. Their most famous (although by no means permanent) member was Armenter Chatmon - better known as Bo Carter - who managed a successful solo career as well as playing with the Sheiks\, which may have contributed to their success. The band named themselves after Rudolph Valentino's film The Sheik (1921).  When the band first recorded in 1930\, the line-up consisted of Carter with Lonnie and Sam Chatmon\, and Walter Vinson. Charlie McCoy (not to be confused with Charlie McCoy\, a later American musician) played later\, when Bo Carter and Sam Chatmon ceased playing full time. It was Lonnie Chatmon and Vinson who formed the real centre of the group.  Bo Carter's solo work is notable for being sexually suggestive in songs such as "My Pencil Won't Write No More" and this is carried on to an extent with the group; however\, like Carter himself the Mississippi Sheiks rarely used double entendres. They primarily earned their income like Robert Johnson and Skip James. They toured throughout the South of the U.S.\, but also reached as far north as Chicago and New York.  Their first and biggest success was "Sitting On Top Of The World" (1930)\, later to be recorded by Howlin' Wolf\, Nat King Cole\, Bill Monroe\, Bob Wills (numerous times)\, Harry Belafonte\, Frank Sinatra\, Bob Dylan\, the Grateful Dead and Jack White\, and re-done by Robert Johnson\, and called Come On in My Kitchen. Throughout their five active years\, the Mississippi Sheiks recorded over seventy songs for the Okeh\, Paramount and Bluebird labels.  When the band dissolved in 1935 the Chatmon brothers gave up music and returned to being farmers\, the most common occupation of black people in rural Mississippi.  The Sheiks and related groups under other names\, such as Mississippi Mud Steppers and Blacksnakes\, recorded about a hundred sides in the first half of the 1930s\, among them original compositions (probably by Vinson) like "The World is Going Wrong" and "I've Got Blood in My Eyes For You" (1931) - both recorded by Bob Dylan - or the topical "Sales Tax" (1934)	0

COL title VAL Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas COL performer VAL Dan + Shay	COL video title VAL Blind Boys of Alabama w/ Susan Tedeschi - People Get Ready - (Live in New Orleans) (HD) COL channel name VAL JR99yes COL description VAL On April 26\, 2008\, the Blind Boys of Alabama played a sold-out show at Tipitina's\, in New Orleans -- the city that was the focus of the band's "Down in New Orleans" CD (released the year before). On that very special night\, the Blind Boys invited some of their favorite musicians to join them: Dr. John\, Preservation Hall Jazz Band\, Henry Butler\, Marva Wright... and Susan Tedeschi.  The set list contained new and old favs -- selections from their New Orleans CD\, as well as songs from the Blind Boys' 4 Grammy-winning albums\, including the great soul-stirring classic\, "People Get Ready."  The packed crowd went wild\, and the whole unforgettable\, historic show was preserved forever on the DVD "The Blind Boys of Alabama - Live in New Orleans" -- from which this clip was taken.  I've always loved this song\, and I'd never heard it done this way. Imo\, it's Susan T. who makes this thing fly. That woman plays and sings like.... like the train really is a comin'! She's just a flat-out GREAT MUSICIAN\, in the purest sense.  Note: I made sure that the audio here is as good as it can possibly be. Ok. Enjoy.  (I claim no copyright ownership whatsoever to any of this material.)  Btw... Can you guess when the Blind Boys first sang together as a band? Hmmm. 1939. (Less than 4 score years after the Civil War!) Wow.	0

It reached number two\, for three weeks on the Billboard Top 40 charts\, becoming his biggest pop hit\, and spent eight non-consecutive weeks at number one on the R&B Best Sellers chart. The version by Fats Domino was also ranked #81 in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

(the first line of Domino's 1950s version of "Blueberry Hill") in reference to pretty girls he dated or wanted to date.  It is one of the songs that the time traveling James Cole enjoys in the film\, Twelve Monkeys\, and the song is later sung by the scientists upon his return to the future.  The song is purportedly named after a "make-out" spot in Taos\, New Mexico.  Joe Edwards' restaurant on the Delmar Loop in St. Louis\, Missouri\, where Chuck Berry frequently plays\, is named after the song.  The Far Side\, a comic written by Gary Larson\, features a comic parodying the lyrics of this song. A man is talking in a phone booth on top of a hill named "Blueberry Hill." He says into the phone "Norm? This is Mitch. ... You were right--I found my drill." The parody is of the line "found my thrill on Blueberry Hill."  Prime Minister of Russia Vladimir Putin made a cover performance of the song on December 10\, 2010 before an audience of international film and television celebrities\, in support of a charity for ill children. Videos of his performance quickly went viral worldwide.	0

Berry Gordy\, along with Gil Askey\, teamed up to record an album for the Supremes singing the Rodgers & Hart songbook and for it to coincide with the airing of the TV special. The girls recorded over 26 songs with Motown planning to release the album as a 2-LP set. However it was cut down to just 12 songs with the other 14 recordings remaining in the Motown vaults until the 1980's. "The Supremes Sing Rodgers & Hart" was released in May 1967 to critical acclaim. Ranging from big band to jazz to the modern sounds of Motown\, the album proved the Supremes could sing anything. It was versatility at its finest.

Room for One More pairs singer Irene Reid with arranger Oliver Nelson and a sprawling who's who of session players including Thad Jones\, Charlie Mariano\, Kenny Burrell\, Phil Woods\, and J.J. Johnson. The title's more than a bit tongue in cheek\, of course\, but given the stature of her collaborators\, Reid no doubt felt some pressure to prove herself worthy of occupying the same studio space\, let alone to claim top billing\, but she does so admirably\, rendering classics like "Save Your Love for Me" and "I Wonder Where Our Love Has Gone" with extraordinary emotional potency. Although best suited for ballads\, most notably a breathtaking reading of "Who Can I Turn To?\," Reid is such a nimble stylist that even a throwaway number like the Bewitched theme still makes its mark. Nelson's spacious arrangements are sublime\, and it almost goes without saying that the band is exemplary. In short\, a wonderful if little-known LP in desperate need of reissue.	0

COL title VAL The Christmas Song COL performer VAL The Charlie Daniels Band	COL video title VAL Glen Campbell - The Christmas Song (Merry Christmas To You) Capitol Records 1968 COL channel name VAL ChristmasTimeTV COL description VAL "The Christmas Song" (commonly subtitled "Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire" or\, as it was originally subtitled\, "Merry Christmas to You") is a classic Christmas song written in 1944 by musician\, composer\, and vocalist Mel Tormé and Bob Wells. According to Tormé\, the song was written during a blistering hot summer. In an effort to "stay cool by thinking cool\," the most-performed (according to BMI) Christmas song was born. The Nat King Cole Trio first recorded the song early in 1946. At Cole's behest — and over the objections of his label\, Capitol Records — a second recording was made the same year utilizing a small string section\, this version becoming a massive hit on both the pop and R&B charts. Cole again recorded the song in 1953\, using the same arrangement with a full orchestra arranged and conducted by Nelson Riddle\, and once more in 1961\, in a stereophonic version with orchestra conducted by Ralph Carmichael. Nat King Cole's 1961 version is generally regarded as definitive\, and in 2004 was the most loved seasonal song with women aged 30--49\, while Cole's original 1946 recording was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1974.   Chestnuts roasting on an open fire  Jack Frost nipping at your nose  Yuletide carols being sung by a choir  And folks dressed up like Eskimos   Everybody knows a turkey and some  Mistletoe help to make the season bright  Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow  Will find it hard to sleep tonight   They know that Santa's on his way  He's loaded lots of toys and goodies  On his sleigh  And every mother's  Child is gonna spy to see if  Reindeer really know how to fly   And so\, I'm offering this  Simple phrase to kids from  One to ninety-two  Altho' it's been said many times  Many ways  "Merry Christmas to you"	1

COL title VAL Nancy COL performer VAL Ray Charles	COL video title VAL Sarah Vaughan - Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye (Roulette Records 1961) COL channel name VAL RoundMidnightTV COL description VAL "Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye" is a song with lyrics and music by Cole Porter. It was introduced in 1944 in Billy Rose's musical revue\, Seven Lively Arts. The bit where it goes 'from major to minor'\, the harmony actually goes from minor to dominant. The song has since become a jazz standard after gaining popularity in the late 50's and early 60's.  Note: Many artists have replaced the apostrophe in "ev'ry" with an "e" and have combined "time" to form the more common "everytime."  After Hours is a 1961 studio album by American jazz singer Sarah Vaughan. This was Vaughan's first album with just guitar and double bass accompaniment\, it was followed by 1963's Sarah + 2 in a similar vein.  The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow awarded After Hours three stars and said that "the emphasis throughout is exclusively on Sassy's magnificent voice. The program mostly sticks to ballads\, with a couple of exceptions...and is a quiet and intimate affair\, with Vaughan more subtle than she sometimes was. Despite a lightweight version of "My Favorite Things" that will not remind listeners of John Coltrane\, this is an excellent if brief set (34-and-a-half minutes) with some fine jazz singing".  Sarah's accompanied by Mundell Lowe (guitar) and  George Duvivier (double bass).  Pictured along with Sarah in video is Richard Davis.  Recorded in RKO-Path Studio\, New York City\, July 18\, 1961. (Roulette Records)  Everytime we say goodbye\, I die a little\, Why the Gods above me\, who must be in the know. Think so little of me\, they allow you to go.  When you're near\, there's such an air of spring about it\, I can hear a lark somewhere\, begin to sing about it\, There's no love song finer\,  But how strange the change from major to minor\, Everytime we say goodbye.

COL title VAL A Day in the Life COL performer VAL Sweet Little Band	COL video title VAL Paul McCartney - A Day In The Life\\Give Peace A Chance Live at Anfield\, Liverpool 1st June COL channel name VAL NaCcache100 COL description VAL A Day in the Life is a song by the British rock band The Beatles. Written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney\, it is the final track on the group's 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The song comprises portions originally authored independently by Lennon and McCartney\, two cacophonous\, part-improvised\, orchestra crescendos\, and a sustained final piano chord. While Lennons lyrics were inspired by contemporary newspaper articles\, McCartneys were reminiscent of his youth. The decisions to link sections of the song with orchestral crescendos and to end the song with a sustained piano chord were made only after the rest of the song had been recorded.  The supposed drug reference in the line Id love to turn you on resulted in the song initially being banned from broadcast by the BBC. The song is highly regarded by critics and is considered one of the most influential songs of all time. In 2004\, Rolling Stone ranked "A Day in the Life" at number 26 on the magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. Since its original album release\, "A Day in the Life" has been released as a B-side\, and also on various compilation albums. It has been covered by other artists including Bobby Darin\, Neil Young\, Jeff Beck\, The Bee Gees\, and since 2008\, by Paul McCartney in his live performances	1

COL title VAL Big Yellow Taxi COL performer VAL Susan Wong	COL video title VAL Mario Lanza - The Loveliest Night of the Year - Gordeeva & Grinkov COL channel name VAL MegaMusiclover1234 COL description VAL Photos of M. Lanza\, Ann Blyth\, and champion ice skaters Ekaterina Gordeeva and Sergei Grinkov skating while Lanza sings\, combine the perfection of Mario's voice with the perfection of Gordeeva and Grinkov's ice skating.  Mario Lanza sings "Loveliest Night of the Year" so very beautifully\, he touches your heart. Long may his legacy live through his movies\, his many recordings\, videos on YouTube and through other media outlets. His voice may never be equaled.  This music was first published as a waltz called "Sobre las olas" ("Over the Waves") in 1888 written by Juventino P. Rosas. In 1950 the music was adapted by Irving Aaronson with lyrics by Paul Francis Webster for the movie The Great Caruso. It was recorded by Mario Lanza and became one of the most popular songs of 1951 reaching No. 3 in the US Billboard Charts. (Information from Wikipedia)  Hedda Hopper\, well-known gossip columnist\, believed that "there had never been anyone like Mario\, and I doubt whether we shall ever see his like again."  Special thanks go to the following web sites and their holders and other media for use of their online photos and video which made this video possible:  Most of the photos of Mario Lanza and Ann Blyth were taken from film clips of his film\, "The Great Caruso"; one photo was taken from his film "That Midnight Kiss". Both films are available for purchase online from Turner Classic Movies.  The video of Ekaterina Gordeeva and Sergei Grinkov of the Soviet Union skating in the Pairs' Long Program in the 1988 Winter Games in Calgary\, Alberta\, Canada\, was posted by 3Axel1996 at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0B0tSnQKzwo.  3Axel1996 has over 3\, 441 videos uploaded for your viewing pleasure on YouTube. 3Axel1996 reported that\, "They skated a near flawless program to win the Gold Medal".  Although Sergei Grinkov has since passed away\, may the many videos of his beautiful skating with his lovely wife Ekaterina Gordeeva preserve their incredibly magnificent skating.

GET HERE Music and Lyrics\, Brenda Russell  You can reach me by railway\, you can reach me by trailway You can reach me on an airplane\, you can reach me with your mind You can reach me by caravan\, cross the desert like an Arab man I don't care how you get here\, just- get here if you can  You can reach me by sailboat\, climb a tree and swing rope to rope Take a sled and slide down slow\, into these arms of mine You can jump on a speedy colt\, cross the border in a blaze of hope I don't care how you get here\, just- get here if you can  There are hills and mountains between us Always something to get over If I had my way\, then surely you would be closer I need you closer  You can windsurf into my life\, take me up on a carpet ride You can make it in a big balloon\, but you better make it soon You can reach me by caravan\, cross the desert like an Arab man I don't care how you get here\, just- get here if you can  I don't care\, I dont care\, I need you right here right now I need you right here\, right now\, right by my side I don't care how you get here\, just- get here if you can.  "Get Here" is a pop ballad written by American singer/songwriter Brenda Russell which became an international hit via a 1990 recording by Oleta Adams\, reaching #4 in the UK and #5 (#8 R&B) in the US.  Brenda Russell had written the song while staying at a penthouse in Stockholm: the tune came to her as she viewed some hot air balloons floating over the city\, a sight Russell recalls set her "really tripping on how many ways you can get to a person" (the eventual song's lyrics include the line: "You can make it in a big balloon but you'd better make it soon"). Although Russell did not pursue the musical ideas that came to her as her current record label saw her as a dance artist and she thought would not be interested in a song such as the one which became "Get Here"\, the song was still in the singer's mind when she woke up the next day: "I don't read or write music [therefore] it's extraordinary if a song is still in my head that I haven't jotted down or recorded. So if it's still in my head overnight\, I think that's something extra special\, it's like somebody trying to tell me something." Russell recorded the song as the title cut of her 1988 album from which it was issued as a single - the album's third - reaching the Top 40 on the Billboard R&B charts.  It was while Oleta Adams was visiting Stockholm that she heard the original Brenda Russell version of "Get Here" playing in a record store and was sufficiently impressed with the song to record it for her 1990 debut album Circle of One. Adams' "Get Here" was issued as a single - after two previous tracks from Circle of One had been released to scant notice - in November 1990; world events at this time gave the song a resonance as an anthem for the US troops in the Gulf War - underscored by the lyrics: "You can reach me by caravan|Cross the desert like an Arab man" - which impelled Adams' single into the Top Ten of the Billboard Hot 100 in the spring of 1991 .  A signature number of Justin Guarini during season #1 of American Idol and included on the Justin Guarini album\, "Get Here" has also been recorded by Vanessa Amorosi\, Paul Anka\, David Archuleta\, Alexia Gardner\, Barbara Mandrell\, Omar Chakil (who wrote French lyrics for his version: "Tu m'as tout donné ")\, Q featuring Tracey Ackerman\, Jennifer Rush\, Livingston Taylor and Jonalyn Viray. A humorous cover\, which featured comedy sound effects after each method of transport mentioned\, was performed by fictional singer Michelle Coffee in the Peter Kay series Phoenix Nights.  The Beautiful South's album Gaze included a song with the same title and\, partially\, similar lyrics - but reversed the theme\, with Paul Heaton protesting his unwillingness to travel any distance at all for his lover. (Sample lyric: "You can get here by helicopter"/"I can barely make Blackpool sands").

Their first release\, the April 1959 single "Rockin' Blues" b/w "Midnight Party"\, came out under the name The Del-Tones\, but the group changed their name soon afterward in a nod to the Bomarc missile. Their breakthrough hit was "Clap Your Hands"\, which hit #1 in Canada and Australia\,[1] and peaked at #45 on the US Billboard pop charts[2] and #40 on Cashbox.[3] The tune was also released in French as "Frappe Tes Mains". Their debut\, ten-track full-length came out in 1960; they appeared on American Bandstand and at a charity concert at Carnegie Hall soon afterward. Two more albums followed before the group broke up in 1963; a 1968 reunion saw "Clap Your Hands" get a re-release.	0

Join our Youtube: https://goo.gl/8AOGaN Join our Facebook: http://goo.gl/5oL723 James Joseph Brown (May 3\, 1933 – December 25\, 2006) was an American singer\, songwriter\, record producer\, dancer and bandleader. The founding father of funk music and a major figure of 20th century popular music and dance\, he is often referred to as the "Godfather of Soul". In a career that spanned six decades\, he influenced the development of several music genres. Brown began his career as a gospel singer in Toccoa\, Georgia. He joined an R&B vocal group\, the Avons (which later evolved into the Flames)\, in which he was the lead singer. First coming to national public attention in the late 1950s as a member of the singing group the Famous Flames with the hit ballads "Please\, Please\, Please" and "Try Me"\, Brown built a reputation as a tireless live performer with the Famous Flames and his backing band\, sometimes known as the James Brown Band or the James Brown Orchestra. His success peaked in the 1960s with the live album Live at the Apollo and hit singles such as "Papa's Got a Brand New Bag"\, "I Got You (I Feel Good)" and "It's a Man's Man's Man's World". During the late 1960s he moved from a continuum of blues and gospel-based forms and styles to a profoundly "Africanized" approach to music-making that influenced the development of funk music. By the early 1970s\, Brown had fully established the funk sound after the formation of the J.B.s with records such as "Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine" and "The Payback". He also became noted for songs of social commentary\, including the 1968 hit "Say It Loud – I'm Black and I'm Proud". Brown continued to perform and record until his death from congestive heart failure in 2006.

COL title VAL Rudolph\, the Red Nosed Reindeer COL performer VAL Arthur Lyman	COL video title VAL C. Henry Hall - I BELIEVE  (1964) COL channel name VAL Anthony Reichardt COL description VAL NO COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT INTENDED - (Mercury 72252)  Out of New York\, this 1964 release is the first of six classy singles issued by Mr. Hall (yes\, 'MISTER') on the Mercury label between 1964 and 1966.  It was somewhat confusing as to why he was credited on the labels of his singles as 'C. Henry Hall'\, 'Carl Henry Hall' and finally 'Carl Hall'.   The tune\, 'I Believe'\, was written by Ervin Drake\, Irvin Graham\, Jimmy Shirl and Al Stillman in 1953 upon request by Jane Froman who was troubled by the escalating Korean War so soon after the end of World War II.  She introduced the song on her television show as as offering of hope and faith to the populace.  The song would go on to be recorded by many artists but this version by Carl Hall is one of the most soulfully and impassioned versions you will ever hear.  Recorded at New York City's A&R Recording Studio with a lushly orchestrated arrangement by an uncredited Claus Ogerman\, Mr. hall takes 'I Believe' straight to the church.  His vocal delivery dips and soars above the building backing track effortlessly until an amazingly emotive\, and climactic end.  I certainly would have loved to have been in the studio to see his performance when 'I Believe' was recorded.  One of the many records that gets promptly tossed into the 'Should'a\, Could'a\, Would'a Been Hits' pile.	0

(Her album "Child of the Seventies" was recorded in 1972\, and was not released until 2006.)  It is such a treat to see that she is now widely appreciated and respected as a major singer.  It only took her four decades! I highly recommend her albums\, from every decade.	0

At the same time\, war and military conflict was such a distant concept for our students\,  I wanted to some how make history relevant to them\, let alone an "Australian" song that most of the our middle school students have never heard.  The more I listened to Bogle's words\, the more I realized that this song was about more than a moment in history. It's about how history repeats itself and the great sacrifices that are made during war and how futile it all is if we fail to learn from our mistakes.  Making the transition from B/W to full colour to coincide with Bogle's words "We started all over again\," I wanted to show how war is part of our past\, present and (unfortunately) future.  Great sacrifices have been made because of war. Bogle asks "What are they marching for?" I say they are marching to honour those sacrifices. If any veteran is offended by this video\, I truly do apologize.  *************************  April 25 - ANZAC Day November 11 - Remembrance Day  "Waltzing Matilda" is a very famous Australian folk song and a "Matilda" was the name given to the pack that Australian farm workers carried on their backs.

COL title VAL Where Eagles Dare COL performer VAL Therapy?	COL video title VAL Gerry Gibbs - 2015 - Live In Studio - 10 Cast Your Fate To The Wind COL channel name VAL JazzTube COL description VAL Personnel Kenny Barron: piano Ron Carter: acoustic bass Gerry Gibbs: drums  Composers Vince Guaraldi  Drummer Gerry Gibbs has been living a recurring dream with slight variations for the past few years. In December of 2012\, he laid down tracks with two of his idols—the legendary Ron Carter and the estimable Kenny Barron—and dubbed their group the Thrasher Dream Trio. The eponymous debut from that band\, featuring fifteen tracks recorded at those sessions\, was\, not surprisingly\, a strong and classy affair filled with standards\, some originals\, and other jazz-friendly fare\, such as Stevie Wonder's "Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing" and Burt Bacharach's "Promises\, Promises."   At the time of that album's release\, those last-mentioned tracks could simply be viewed as part of the well-rounded program. But looking back now\, it actually seems like they were dropped as hints of what was to come. About a year-and-a-half after that first Thrasher Dream Trio album was recorded\, Gibbs brought the band together again to lay things down for We're Back (Whaling City Sound\, 2014)\, a jazz-does-R&B project with A-list guests—vibraphonist Warren Wolf\, saxophonist Steve Wilson\, and organist Larry Goldings. That album offered multiple helpings of Wonder and Earth\, Wind & Fire along with single servings of Bacharach\, Marvin Gaye\, Miles Davis\, and the Average White Band. As on the trio's first album\, the sparks were flying. The playing field\, however\, had changed a bit.   For this\, the third go-around for this group\, Gibbs does it again\, tweaking the formula without altering the essence of the trio. This time he turned the focus toward pop-ish material from the '50s and '60s—the work of Bacharach\, Henry Mancini\, Michel Legrand\, and others of that ilk—and put an audience in front of the band\, recording live at Systems Two Recording Studio. Guests are part of the package again—now it's trumpeter Roy Hargrove and vocalist Cassandra Wilson\, each appearing on a few tracks—and they help to add another wrinkle or two to the project without drawing focus away from the trio.   The album opens on a fluid "Wives And Lovers" that allows Barron's lyricism to shine through\, gives Carter a chance to step into the spotlight\, and puts Gibbs' brushwork at center stage. From there\, the trio moves on with an unusually upbeat take on "The Summer Knows\," a Wilson-enhanced version of "The Look Of Love" that moves from bossa nova to swing\, and a variety of other familiar hits of yesteryear. Hargrove joins in for "On A Clear Day\," quoting Ellington at one point and playfully trading solos with Gibbs; Vince Guaraldi's cheerfulness shines through on a perky trio performance of his "Cast Your Fate To The Wind"; "More" is transformed from a stale confection into an enjoyable swinger; and "Watch What Happens" happens twice—first as a cheerful\, Brazilian-based instrumental\, then as a swing-centered feature for Wilson.   Along the way there are plenty of other bright spots—an appropriately noir-ish "What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life?" with Hargrove on flugelhorn\, a leisurely stroll through "Girl Talk"—and plenty of moments that serve as simple reminders as to why Barron and Carter are loved\, respected\, and emulated the world over. Their time and taste are impeccable\, and when married to Gibbs' in-the-tradition drumming\, you know the music is going to go in the right direction every time.

COL title VAL Mighty Quinn COL performer VAL Chris Thompson & Mads Eriksen Band	COL video title VAL C. Henry Hall - I BELIEVE  (1964) COL channel name VAL Anthony Reichardt COL description VAL NO COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT INTENDED - (Mercury 72252)  Out of New York\, this 1964 release is the first of six classy singles issued by Mr. Hall (yes\, 'MISTER') on the Mercury label between 1964 and 1966.  It was somewhat confusing as to why he was credited on the labels of his singles as 'C. Henry Hall'\, 'Carl Henry Hall' and finally 'Carl Hall'.   The tune\, 'I Believe'\, was written by Ervin Drake\, Irvin Graham\, Jimmy Shirl and Al Stillman in 1953 upon request by Jane Froman who was troubled by the escalating Korean War so soon after the end of World War II.  She introduced the song on her television show as as offering of hope and faith to the populace.  The song would go on to be recorded by many artists but this version by Carl Hall is one of the most soulfully and impassioned versions you will ever hear.  Recorded at New York City's A&R Recording Studio with a lushly orchestrated arrangement by an uncredited Claus Ogerman\, Mr. hall takes 'I Believe' straight to the church.  His vocal delivery dips and soars above the building backing track effortlessly until an amazingly emotive\, and climactic end.  I certainly would have loved to have been in the studio to see his performance when 'I Believe' was recorded.  One of the many records that gets promptly tossed into the 'Should'a\, Could'a\, Would'a Been Hits' pile.	0

COL title VAL Railroad Worksong COL performer VAL The Notting Hillbillies	COL video title VAL Red Patterson's Piedmont Log Rollers - Down on the Banks of the Ohio (1927) COL channel name VAL ArkivArkiv COL description VAL "Banks of the Ohio" is a 19th century murder ballad\, written by unknown authors\, in which "Willie" invites his young lover for a walk during which she rejects his marriage proposal. Once they are alone on the river bank\, he murders the young woman. It is also known by the longer title Down On The Banks Of The Ohio The first recording of the song was by Red Patterson's Piedmont Log Rollers on August 12\, 1927. The song has since been recorded numerous times\, such as by New Lost City Ramblers\, The Wolfe Tones\, G. B. Grayson and Henry Whitter (as "I'll Never Be Yours")\, Ernest Stoneman\, Clayton McMichen\, Bascom Lamar Lunsford\, The Carter Family\, Blue Sky Boys (whose version\, performed in 1936\, appears in the soundtrack of the 1973 film Paper Moon)\, Johnny Cash\, Porter Wagoner\, Pete Seeger\, Monroe Brothers\, Joan Baez\, Olivia Newton-John (with Mike Sammes\, in 1971\, her second commercial single in the United States)\, Dave Guard and the Whiskeyhill Singers\, Mike Ireland and Holler\, The Callagan Brothers\, and Doc Watson\, with slightly different lyrics when sung by a female. The song is similar in subject to "Pretty Polly"\, and likely tells the same story (Both songs date from approximately the same time\, tell roughly the same story\, and feature a villain named "Willie").  Red Patterson's Piedmont Log Rollers: Red Patterson vocals/banjo\, Percy Setcliff violin\, Dick Nolen tenor banjo\, Lee Nolen guitar.	0

COL title VAL In Other Words (Fly Me to the Moon) COL performer VAL James Moody	COL video title VAL Mildred Bailey - I Don't Stand A Ghost Of A Chance With You - 1939 COL channel name VAL warholsoup100 COL description VAL Vintage Radio Slideshow. Mildred Bailey (February 27\, 1907 -- December 12\, 1951) was a popular and influential American jazz singer during the 1930s\, known as "The Rockin' Chair Lady" and "Mrs. Swing". Her number one hits were "Please Be Kind"\, "Darn That Dream"\, "Rockin' Chair" and "Says My Heart". In the mid 1930s\, she recorded with her third husband Red Norvo. A dynamic couple\, they earned the nicknames "Mr. and Mrs. Swing". During this period (1936--1939) Norvo recorded for Brunswick (with Bailey as primary vocalist) and Bailey recorded her own set of recordings for Vocalion\, often with Norvo's band. Some of her recordings instead featured members of Count Basie's band. Despite her divorce from Norvo\, she and Red would continue to record together until 1945. Suffering from diabetes and depression (during her adult life Bailey was overweight)\, she only made a few recordings following World War II.  Mildred Bailey died December 12\, 1951\, in Poughkeepsie\, New York\, of heart failure\, aged 44\, chiefly due to her diabetes. Her ashes were scattered. Red Norvo outlived Bailey by nearly half a century\, dying in April 1999\, a week after his 91st birthday. "I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You" is a 1932 song composed by Victor Young\, with lyrics written by Ned Washington and Bing Crosby\, recorded on October 14\, 1932 by Bing Crosby in New York. In 1939\, Mildred Bailey fronted a six-side\, mostly blues session as "Mildred Bailey and her Oxford Greys" for Vocalion\, which featured a small mixed-race combo of Mary Lou Williams (piano)\, Floyd Smith (electric guitar)\, John Williams (bass) and Eddie Dougherty (drums).	0

Richards was blinded in the left eye at the age of four in an archery accident\, and lost sight in the right eye as well some years later. He first began playing in a group called The Five Pearls while still a teen in the 1950s. His first appearance on record was a single titled "All About Ann"\, released on Cincinnati\, Ohio label Fraternity Records. He moved to Los Angeles with an ensemble in the early 1960s\, but his band failed and he returned to West Virginia. Later in the 1960s he moved to New York. He played the uptown East Side local Bar's (Malachy's II) (72nd & Lexington) and eventually found success in New York.He released his debut album on Warner Bros. Records in 1970. He scored two minor hit singles in the US in the early 1970s. Further releases followed later in the decade\, as did a third hit in 1980. On September 1\, 2011 Turley Richards Said "My! the world is crazy. I just found out this week that Richard Turley (my given name before changing it) on Fraternity Records in 1959 song 'Making Love With My Baby' has put me in the Rockabilly Hall of fame. I'm so flattered."  Lyrics : My World Is Empty Without You\, babe. My World Is Empty Without You\, babe. And as I go my way alone\, I find it hard for me to carry on. I need your strength\,  I need your tender touch I need the love\, my dear\, I miss so much.  My World Is Empty Without You\, babe. My World Is Empty Without You\, babe. From this old world I try to hide my face\, But from this loneliness there's no hiding place. Inside this cold and empty house I dwell\, in darkness with memories I know so well.  I need your love more than before\,  I can hardly carry on anymore. My World Is Empty Without You\, babe\,  without you babe\,without you babe\, My mind and soul have felt like this\, Since love between us no more exist.  And each time that darkness falls\, if finds me alone with these four walls.  My World Is Empty Without You\, babe. My World Is Empty Without You\, babe.

GET HERE Music and Lyrics\, Brenda Russell  You can reach me by railway\, you can reach me by trailway You can reach me on an airplane\, you can reach me with your mind You can reach me by caravan\, cross the desert like an Arab man I don't care how you get here\, just- get here if you can  You can reach me by sailboat\, climb a tree and swing rope to rope Take a sled and slide down slow\, into these arms of mine You can jump on a speedy colt\, cross the border in a blaze of hope I don't care how you get here\, just- get here if you can  There are hills and mountains between us Always something to get over If I had my way\, then surely you would be closer I need you closer  You can windsurf into my life\, take me up on a carpet ride You can make it in a big balloon\, but you better make it soon You can reach me by caravan\, cross the desert like an Arab man I don't care how you get here\, just- get here if you can  I don't care\, I dont care\, I need you right here right now I need you right here\, right now\, right by my side I don't care how you get here\, just- get here if you can.  "Get Here" is a pop ballad written by American singer/songwriter Brenda Russell which became an international hit via a 1990 recording by Oleta Adams\, reaching #4 in the UK and #5 (#8 R&B) in the US.  Brenda Russell had written the song while staying at a penthouse in Stockholm: the tune came to her as she viewed some hot air balloons floating over the city\, a sight Russell recalls set her "really tripping on how many ways you can get to a person" (the eventual song's lyrics include the line: "You can make it in a big balloon but you'd better make it soon"). Although Russell did not pursue the musical ideas that came to her as her current record label saw her as a dance artist and she thought would not be interested in a song such as the one which became "Get Here"\, the song was still in the singer's mind when she woke up the next day: "I don't read or write music [therefore] it's extraordinary if a song is still in my head that I haven't jotted down or recorded. So if it's still in my head overnight\, I think that's something extra special\, it's like somebody trying to tell me something." Russell recorded the song as the title cut of her 1988 album from which it was issued as a single - the album's third - reaching the Top 40 on the Billboard R&B charts.  It was while Oleta Adams was visiting Stockholm that she heard the original Brenda Russell version of "Get Here" playing in a record store and was sufficiently impressed with the song to record it for her 1990 debut album Circle of One. Adams' "Get Here" was issued as a single - after two previous tracks from Circle of One had been released to scant notice - in November 1990; world events at this time gave the song a resonance as an anthem for the US troops in the Gulf War - underscored by the lyrics: "You can reach me by caravan|Cross the desert like an Arab man" - which impelled Adams' single into the Top Ten of the Billboard Hot 100 in the spring of 1991 .  A signature number of Justin Guarini during season #1 of American Idol and included on the Justin Guarini album\, "Get Here" has also been recorded by Vanessa Amorosi\, Paul Anka\, David Archuleta\, Alexia Gardner\, Barbara Mandrell\, Omar Chakil (who wrote French lyrics for his version: "Tu m'as tout donné ")\, Q featuring Tracey Ackerman\, Jennifer Rush\, Livingston Taylor and Jonalyn Viray. A humorous cover\, which featured comedy sound effects after each method of transport mentioned\, was performed by fictional singer Michelle Coffee in the Peter Kay series Phoenix Nights.  The Beautiful South's album Gaze included a song with the same title and\, partially\, similar lyrics - but reversed the theme\, with Paul Heaton protesting his unwillingness to travel any distance at all for his lover. (Sample lyric: "You can get here by helicopter"/"I can barely make Blackpool sands").

COL title VAL The House of the Rising Sun COL performer VAL Dolly Parton	COL video title VAL Mildred Bailey - I Don't Stand A Ghost Of A Chance With You - 1939 COL channel name VAL warholsoup100 COL description VAL Vintage Radio Slideshow. Mildred Bailey (February 27\, 1907 -- December 12\, 1951) was a popular and influential American jazz singer during the 1930s\, known as "The Rockin' Chair Lady" and "Mrs. Swing". Her number one hits were "Please Be Kind"\, "Darn That Dream"\, "Rockin' Chair" and "Says My Heart". In the mid 1930s\, she recorded with her third husband Red Norvo. A dynamic couple\, they earned the nicknames "Mr. and Mrs. Swing". During this period (1936--1939) Norvo recorded for Brunswick (with Bailey as primary vocalist) and Bailey recorded her own set of recordings for Vocalion\, often with Norvo's band. Some of her recordings instead featured members of Count Basie's band. Despite her divorce from Norvo\, she and Red would continue to record together until 1945. Suffering from diabetes and depression (during her adult life Bailey was overweight)\, she only made a few recordings following World War II.  Mildred Bailey died December 12\, 1951\, in Poughkeepsie\, New York\, of heart failure\, aged 44\, chiefly due to her diabetes. Her ashes were scattered. Red Norvo outlived Bailey by nearly half a century\, dying in April 1999\, a week after his 91st birthday. "I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You" is a 1932 song composed by Victor Young\, with lyrics written by Ned Washington and Bing Crosby\, recorded on October 14\, 1932 by Bing Crosby in New York. In 1939\, Mildred Bailey fronted a six-side\, mostly blues session as "Mildred Bailey and her Oxford Greys" for Vocalion\, which featured a small mixed-race combo of Mary Lou Williams (piano)\, Floyd Smith (electric guitar)\, John Williams (bass) and Eddie Dougherty (drums).	0

Randazzo\, a childhood friend of the group\, wrote the song especially for them\, having also supplied the group with their previous Top 20 Hit "I'm on the Outside (Looking In)". Their original version of the song was a Billboard Top 10 Pop hit\, reaching #6 on the Billboard Hot 100\, and #1 in the Canadian RPM-list in 1965. The song peaked at #8 on Cashbox magazine's R&B chart (Billboard was in a chart recess for R&B listings at that time). The Little Anthony & the Imperials original recording is the most commonly known version of the song\, and the definitive version\, although it's since been covered by many other artists.

COL title VAL I'll Be Seeing You COL performer VAL Rosemary Clooney	COL video title VAL Edda Magnasson - Trubbel COL channel name VAL Emilia Arroyo COL description VAL Nu lyser ängarna av sommarns alla blommor. Nu surrar bin\, och fåglar sjunger överallt. Nu stryker vinden genom trädens höga kronor men i min trädgård är det visset\, mörkt och kallt. Här är det risigt och förvuxet\, fult och snårigt och lika hopplöst grått och trist som i mitt bröst. Därute doftar det av sommarns alla dofter. Där är det sommar\, men här inne är det höst.  Jag levde lycklig här med dig och mina katter ett liv i synd och utan omsorg att bli frälst. Försonad med min karaktär\, för jag har aldrig förmott att säga nej till någonting som helst. Och aldrig nekat mig det ena eller andra\, och levat livet\, tills jag krossades en dag. Det börja med att du bedrog mig med en annan\, en som du sa var mycket finare än jag.  Vårt gräl tog veckor\, ropen blandades med gråten och jag blev grundligt jämförd med din fina vän Tills du bekände att hon givit dig på båten Då blev det dödstyst här i trädgården igen! Ifrån den stunden var den kvinnan dubbelt hatad Hon hade lekt med dig\, med oss ett litet slag Och ja jag kände det som även jag var ratad Jag ville slåss\, och gick mot mitt livs nederlag  Jag kom med hammaren beredd under min kappa När hon kom ut i sidenpumps och sa: God dag! Kom in och slå dig ner en stund så får vi prata! Jag bara stammade\, nu minns jag inte vad... Och jag blev bjuden på likör och cigarriller och kunde inte få mig till att säga nej! Och när vi skiljdes var vi bästisar och bundis och jag tog saker som du glömt med hem till dig!  Jag går omkring i mitt pompej\, i bland ruiner och jag traskar runt i resterna utav vårt liv Men du skall aldrig ge mig pikar om sekiner och aldrig skall du bli en annans tidsfördriv! Nej\, åt det gamla skall vi binda vackra kransar och ta vårt liv och mina katter som de är. Och trots all kärleksbrist och trasighet och fransar Dig skall jag älska livet ut\, dig har jag kär!	0

COL title VAL The Peanut Vendor COL performer VAL Louis Armstrong and His Sebastian New Cotton Club Orchestra	COL video title VAL California Ramblers Wally Edwards Orch. - Peanut Vendor 1930 El Manisero COL channel name VAL warholsoup100 COL description VAL Peanut vendor 12-2-1930. 1930 California Ramblers. Columbia 2351 Columbia DC104. First recording of this song by a U.S. group. Yes\, it's the Ramblers\, not the usual sound you might think. The California Ramblers were a popular and prolific jazz group from the 1920s\, that recorded hundreds of songs under many different record labels throughout the 1920s. Three of the members of the band\, Red Nichols\, Jimmy Dorsey\, and Tommy Dorsey\, would go on to front big bands in later decades. The original bandmembers were from Ohio\, but chose the name California Ramblers because they thought people would be less inclined to listen to a jazz band from the Midwest. The Peanut Vendor (original title: El Manisero) is a Cuban song based on a street-seller's cry\, and known as a pregón. It is possibly the most famous piece of music created by a Cuban musician. The Peanut Vendor has been recorded more than 160 times\, sold over a million copies of the sheet music\, and was the first million-selling 78rpm of Cuban music.	1

COL title VAL My Luve Is Like a Red\, Red Rose COL performer VAL Only Men Aloud	COL video title VAL ELIO PACE - You Never Can Tell (from the album 'Come And Get It' 2002) 4 of 16 COL channel name VAL rosarecordsonline COL description VAL 'You Never Can Tell' was written and originally recorded by Chuck Berry.  _________________________  A message from Elio...  The original concept behind 'Come And Get It'\, was to produce a high quality demo for me and my band to use as promotion with a view to attracting bigger and better corporate work as a 'covers band'. It was never intended for commercial release. Proving this point\, the original two-thousand CDs pressed in February 2002\, had no barcode on the artwork.  In fact\, the idea (going into the first day of recording) was to record only segments of 10 or 12 songs and to create a five-minute showreel. It was only just as recording was about to commence that Darren Loveday (one of two guitarists in the band at the time and my co-producer on the project) suggested that for the time it took to decide which segment of each song should be recorded\, we may as well play the whole song from start to finish\, especially as we all knew the songs so well\, having played them so many times. It was only when listening back the following day to the 13-tracks we'd recorded\, that Darren and I decided to create a full album of the material.  It was also decided that along with the 13 'new' songs\, we should make use of the 74-minutes available on CD (at the time) and include; a previous demo we'd made in 1998 of Billy Joel's 'My Life'; a live stereo recording (off MiniDisc\, with a few overdubs) of Jerry Lee Lewis' 'Great Balls Of Fire' from August 2000; and demos of three original songs I'd written (Addicted To The Phone\, Got The Bug Back and Katy Likes House) which would eventually be re-recorded and released on my 2009 'debut' album\, 'A Seat At My Table.  The last item that we decided to include on this original 19-track album was a 1998 demo we had recorded of Delbert McClinton's 'Two More Bottles Of Wine'. Ironically\, it was THIS little track (with just myself on piano\, Darren on guitar and the both of us doing the backing vocals and hand-claps) that realised the original concept for this album and opened a huge door for me in my career. Sir Terry Wogan and the late Paul Walters\, working together on BBC Radio 2's 'Wake Up To Wogan'\, played my version of 'Two More Bottles Of Wine' on their show\, once a week for six-months\, from August 2003. It was the first time that one of my recordings had been played on national radio in the UK. I really wasn't prepared for it as I didn't even have a website at the time.  I eventually got my act together and although casually stocked in a hand-full of small record shops\, 'Come And Get It' (on my own label\, Rosa Records) became available to buy in 2005 on CD via my website and then released to the general public as a download in 2007. This digital release and the subsequent CD pressings does not include the three demos of my songs... for obvious reasons. Now discontinued\, you would have to hunt down one of the original batch of those two-thousand CDs pressed in February 2002.  By the way\, the billing as 'The Elio Pace Band' was purely to guarantee that prospective clients knew that they were not booking just an individual at a piano and to differentiate between my two 'hats' as a performer; a) playing 'dance party' covers and b) playing my own material\, for which I would simply be known as Elio Pace. Interestingly\, Terry Wogan never once announced my record as 'The Elio Pace Band'. Instead he always referred to me as "Elio Pace and his band". 'Come And Get It' was the first and only album that will have 'The Elio Pace Band' as the artist name although I fully expect to record another album of covers sometime in the future.  _________________________  Track listing:  1.

It takes a great singer to really do justice to Dylan\, yet KT goes well beyond that and makes this her own. She's just that good live.  I work nights in a television studio and used to come home in the morning to find absolutely nothing interesting to watch on television. The last thing I wanted to see was more commercials. And I'm not really interested in watching talk shows and soap operas.  Then I discovered the commercial free music channel RAVE. HD quality video and pretty much perfect 5.1 sound. A few times a week they run "Later With Jools Holland" in the morning. Jools has great taste in music and each show runs the gamut from pop\, rock\, folk\, Celtic\, African\, to Joanna Newsome. Something for everyone. Suffice to say I love this show.  Uploaded as a high quality 640 x 480 MPEG4 file using Pinnacle Studio.

COL title VAL The Christmas Song COL performer VAL Anthony Hamilton featuring Chaka Khan	COL video title VAL Glen Campbell - The Christmas Song (Merry Christmas To You) Capitol Records 1968 COL channel name VAL ChristmasTimeTV COL description VAL "The Christmas Song" (commonly subtitled "Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire" or\, as it was originally subtitled\, "Merry Christmas to You") is a classic Christmas song written in 1944 by musician\, composer\, and vocalist Mel Tormé and Bob Wells. According to Tormé\, the song was written during a blistering hot summer. In an effort to "stay cool by thinking cool\," the most-performed (according to BMI) Christmas song was born. The Nat King Cole Trio first recorded the song early in 1946. At Cole's behest — and over the objections of his label\, Capitol Records — a second recording was made the same year utilizing a small string section\, this version becoming a massive hit on both the pop and R&B charts. Cole again recorded the song in 1953\, using the same arrangement with a full orchestra arranged and conducted by Nelson Riddle\, and once more in 1961\, in a stereophonic version with orchestra conducted by Ralph Carmichael. Nat King Cole's 1961 version is generally regarded as definitive\, and in 2004 was the most loved seasonal song with women aged 30--49\, while Cole's original 1946 recording was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1974.   Chestnuts roasting on an open fire  Jack Frost nipping at your nose  Yuletide carols being sung by a choir  And folks dressed up like Eskimos   Everybody knows a turkey and some  Mistletoe help to make the season bright  Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow  Will find it hard to sleep tonight   They know that Santa's on his way  He's loaded lots of toys and goodies  On his sleigh  And every mother's  Child is gonna spy to see if  Reindeer really know how to fly   And so\, I'm offering this  Simple phrase to kids from  One to ninety-two  Altho' it's been said many times  Many ways  "Merry Christmas to you"	1

Es que desde hace mucho tiempo solo teníamos de este grupo una pequeña foto borrosa y una reseña en inglés que subió George Bonilla al sitio http://www.incarock.com. Yo nunca los había escuchado.  En 1964\, Diego García Sayán\, los hermanos José y Freddy Rizo Patrón\, Ramón Orbegoso y Felipe Larrabure\, formaron Los Hang Tens (1964-1968). Ellos eran compañeros de estudios del colegio Santa María en el distrito San Isidro. "Una banda que se formó sin la pretensión de convertirse en grupo profesional\, pues el principal propósito era reunirse para disfrutar de la música y entretener a sus amigos en fiestas y funciones escolares"\, dice Bonilla. Según esta misma referencia\, ellos (como ya muchos en el mundo) habían caído bajo el influjo de la llamada "invasión británica": Beatles\, Rolling Stones\, Kinks\, Yarbirds\, Dave Clark Five\, Animals\, Herman Hermits\, etc. También participaron en el grupo Manuel Sanguinetti\, Juan de Aliaga\, Jaime Sabal y Guillermo Pérez Argüello\, remplazando o alternándose con los fundadores. La popularidad del grupo atrajo la atención del sello Odeon\, que les propuso grabar un 45 rpm\, que ahora se ha convertido en pieza de colección: "Till the end of the day" (del grupo The Kinks) en el lado A y "These boots were made for walking" (que popularizara Nancy Sinatra) en el lado B. El disco salió en 1966. En 1967\, los hermanos Rizo Patrón y Manuel Sanguinetti ya planeaban crear un grupo de mayores proyecciones: Traffic Sound. Pero esa ya es otra historia (y qué historia).	0

COL title VAL Bewitched\, Bothered and Bewildered COL performer VAL Anita O'Day	COL video title VAL Earl Bostic -- Bugle Call Rag (VintageMusic.es) COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL 1913 -- 1965 El saxo alto Earl Bostic fue un auténtico master de su instrumento\, a pesar de ser infravalorado por los aficionados al jazz a causa de sus grabaciones de estilo jump que hiciera durante los años 50s y 60s.  Nacido en Tulsa\, Oklahoma\, Eugene Earl Bostic\, tocó por el territorio del Medio Oeste a principios de los años 30. Estudió en la Xavier University\, e hizo giras con varias bandas antes de trasladarse a New York en 1938. En esa ciudad tocó con Don Redman y Lionel Hampton\, con quien grabó su primer disco en 1939.  A principios de los años 40\, Bostic trabajó como arreglista y músico de sesión y formó su primera banda en 1945\, empezando a grabar regularmente consiguiendo su primer hit en 1948 con la pieza "Temptation". Enseguida firmó con la discográfica King\, la casa de la mayoría de sus éxitos de los jukebox\, que habitualmente se caracterizaba por un fuerte driving y un contagioso ritmo beat\, servido por el potente sonido del alto de Bostic en su faceta más romántica o agresiva y bluesy  En 1951\, Bostic consiguió un numero uno en las listas de éxitos con "Flamingo" al que siguieron varios más\, como "Sleep"\, "You Go to My Head" y "Cherokee". Por los grupos de Bostic desfilaron muchos jóvenes jazzmen tales como John Coltrane\, Blue Mitchell\, Benny Golson\, Stanley Turrentine\, Jaki Byard y otros muchos. Desgraciadamente\, Bostic sufrió un ataque al corazón a finales de los años 50s\, que le apartó de la música durante dos años. Regresó en 1959 pero no grabó tan extensamente y las sesiones de los 60s fueron más de corte Soul Jazz que de R&B.  Bostic murió de un fatal ataque al corazón mientras tocaba en un hotel de Rochester\, New York.

Though love is blind\, make up your mind I've got to know Should I hang up or will you tell her she'll have to go?  You can't say the words I want to hear While you're with another friend Do you want me answer yes or no? Darling\, I will understand  Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone Let's pretend that we're together all alone I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low And you can tell your friend there with you\, she'll have to go	1

Why should our magical moments of madness Be leaving me with such a feeling of sadness? I know I am playing a forbidden game For the girl that I love is not sharing my name.  There isn't anything special about her But try as I may\, life means nothing without her Perhaps I'm a fool to be hoping in vain But I know that I'm playing a forbidden game.  No one can tell me how long love will last If the future will bring me much more than the past Should I show her I worry? I don't think I dare When my happiness lies in each moment we share.  I'll go on loving her\, just as before For she's all that I want\, and I ask nothing more And if things should go wrong\, I must take all the blame For you're bound to get hurt playing forbidden games.	0

COL title VAL A Day in the Life COL performer VAL Sweet Little Band	COL video title VAL 99 Red Balloons Parody - 99 Dead Baboons COL channel name VAL Axel Noble COL description VAL Someone requesting for the lyrics\, So\, here is it. =) Let's now sing this song all together! Wew!   Hey\, have a lot of you heard the new song by Nena - "99 Red Balloons"? You know\, I heard the German version of that song first\, and I really liked it. But then I heard the English version\, and I was really surprised to find that what she's singing in English and what she's singing in German are not even close. Uh\, I ended up buying the record\, and I listened very closely to the German version\, and I've come up with a new English translation that I think is really much more accurate\, much closer... I have to admit there are a couple of lines in this new English version that I'm not real sure about\, but I think it's a much more accurate version. Now this is the new version\, "99 Red Balloons".  Hello Bobby my old friend. It's good to see you once again. How's your mother\, how's your aunt? How's your father's skin diving suit? (That's one of the lines I'm not real sure about\, but it goes something like this.)  I've got something you should see Back at my place; come with me. I've got some brand new furnishings\, Plus 99 dead baboons  99 dead baboons Sitting in my living room. Not too functional it seems\, But quite a conversation piece. This one's Jake\, that one's Dinah\, There's big Ned in my recliner. No it's not a lazy boy. Can't you see it's a dead baboon?  Dead baboons\, dead baboons. Dead baboons\, dead baboons.  How they got here I'm not sure; Woke up one day\, there they were. Luckily I've got a lease Allowing pets if they're deceased. I'm just thankful they're not apes\, 'Cuz apes would clash with the drapes. No more napkins at my parties - Wipe your hands on a dead baboon.  Dead baboons\, dead baboons. Dead baboons\, dead baboons.  Dead baboons are lots of fun; Playin' water balloons I've always won. You can keep your dead giraffes and swine\, I'll take dead baboons every time. There's just one problem I have found: It's finding Purina Dead Baboon Chow. But what a happy snorkelling device... (That's another line I'm not real sure about\, but it's somethin' like that) With 99 dead baboons.  Dead baboons\, dead baboons. Dead baboons\, dead baboons.	0

L'auteur de L'écume des jours a su trouver les mots qui sonnent avec grâce. La direction musicale de Laurent De Wild est un "Voyage au Paradis".  Libération -- 2009 -- Bruno Pfeiffer -- Diane chante Vian tel que -- Un météore a explosé la surface tranquille de la lune : son dernier disque "Docteur Boris et Mister Vian". Le travail enduit de baume les oreilles\, puis le reste de la carcasse. C'est tout simplement extra... Un régal. Vian n'aurait sans doute pas hésité à applaudir « Rue de la flemme ». Quel concentré de swing relâché! Quel modèle de grande chanson (tour de force de la traduction)! Pourquoi  citer seulement  le savoureux « Voyage au Paradis » ? Les onze valent le coup. Le disque passe comme un remède à l'imbécillité de la période actuelle... La profondeur légère de l'interprétation s'offre comme un cadeau. Les chorus de Laurent de Wilde\, huit ou seize mesures maxi\, ne goinfrent pas la mise en place. La complicité de l'ensemble se ressent du respect flagrant que se portent les artistes. Le prochain qui me classe Diane Tell dans la variété\, je l'enjoins : jazzons les idées préconçues.

COL title VAL Yours Until Tomorrow COL performer VAL Florence Ballard	COL video title VAL Ella Fitzgerald ft Ralph Carmichael & Orchestra - It Came Upon A Midnight Clear (Capitol Rec 1967) COL channel name VAL ChristmasTimeTV COL description VAL "It Came Upon a Midnight Clear" (sometimes rendered as "It Came Upon a Midnight Clear") is a poem and Christmas carol written by Edmund Sears\, pastor of the Unitarian Church in Lancaster\, Massachusetts. Sears' lyrics are most commonly set to one of two melodies: "Carol\," composed by Richard Storrs Willis\, or "Noel\," adapted from an English melody.  Ella's accompanied by Ralph Carmichael & Orchestra.  (Capitol Records)  It came upon the midnight clear\,  That glorious song of old\,  From angels bending near the earth  To touch their harps of gold! Peace on the earth\, good will to men\,  From heaven's all gracious King!  The world in solemn stillness lay  To hear the angels sing.   Still through the cloven skies they come  With peaceful wings unfurled  And still their heavenly music floats  O'er all the weary world;  Above its sad and lowly plains  They bend on hovering wing.  And ever o'er its Babel sounds  The blessed angels sing.  Yet with te woes of sin and strife  The world hath suffered long;  Beneath the angel-strain have rolled  Two thousand years of wrong;  And man\, at war with man\, hears not  The love song which they bring:  O hush the noise\, ye men of strife\,  And hear the angels sing.   For lo! the days are hastening on\,  By prophet bards foretold\,  When\, with the ever-circling years\,  Shall come the Age of Gold;  When peace shall over all the earth  Its ancient splendors fling\,  And all the world give back the song  Which now the angels sing.	0

COL title VAL Just the Way You Are COL performer VAL Bruno Mars	COL video title VAL Roots of Blues -- The Mississippi Sheiks „Sitting On Top Of T COL channel name VAL Literatisch COL description VAL „Sitting On Top Of The World" (Hawks -- Jefferson - Simmons)  Recorded: no details available  The Mississippi Sheiks were a popular and influential guitar and fiddle group of the 1930s. They were notable mostly for playing country blues but were adept at many styles of United States popular music of the time\, and their records were bought by both black and white audiences. Country blues is often seen as being the domain of individual musicians\, a stereotype propagated by the way such delta blues performers as Robert Johnson and Charley Patton have entered the popular consciousness. Of the smaller number of groups playing at the time\, the Mississippi Sheiks are among the better known and most influential among their peers.  In 2004\, they were inducted in the Mississippi Musicians Hall of Fame. Their 1930 blues single "Sitting on Top of the World" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2008.  The Mississippi Sheiks consisted mainly of the Chatmon family\, who came from Bolton\, Mississippi and were well known throughout the Mississippi Delta; the father of the family had been a "musicianer" during times of black slavery\, and his children carried on the musical spirit. Their most famous (although by no means permanent) member was Armenter Chatmon - better known as Bo Carter - who managed a successful solo career as well as playing with the Sheiks\, which may have contributed to their success. The band named themselves after Rudolph Valentino's film The Sheik (1921).  When the band first recorded in 1930\, the line-up consisted of Carter with Lonnie and Sam Chatmon\, and Walter Vinson. Charlie McCoy (not to be confused with Charlie McCoy\, a later American musician) played later\, when Bo Carter and Sam Chatmon ceased playing full time. It was Lonnie Chatmon and Vinson who formed the real centre of the group.  Bo Carter's solo work is notable for being sexually suggestive in songs such as "My Pencil Won't Write No More" and this is carried on to an extent with the group; however\, like Carter himself the Mississippi Sheiks rarely used double entendres. They primarily earned their income like Robert Johnson and Skip James. They toured throughout the South of the U.S.\, but also reached as far north as Chicago and New York.  Their first and biggest success was "Sitting On Top Of The World" (1930)\, later to be recorded by Howlin' Wolf\, Nat King Cole\, Bill Monroe\, Bob Wills (numerous times)\, Harry Belafonte\, Frank Sinatra\, Bob Dylan\, the Grateful Dead and Jack White\, and re-done by Robert Johnson\, and called Come On in My Kitchen. Throughout their five active years\, the Mississippi Sheiks recorded over seventy songs for the Okeh\, Paramount and Bluebird labels.  When the band dissolved in 1935 the Chatmon brothers gave up music and returned to being farmers\, the most common occupation of black people in rural Mississippi.  The Sheiks and related groups under other names\, such as Mississippi Mud Steppers and Blacksnakes\, recorded about a hundred sides in the first half of the 1930s\, among them original compositions (probably by Vinson) like "The World is Going Wrong" and "I've Got Blood in My Eyes For You" (1931) - both recorded by Bob Dylan - or the topical "Sales Tax" (1934)	0

COL title VAL Medley - Cupid / I've Loved You For a Long Time COL performer VAL The Spinners	COL video title VAL Eydie Gorme   Round Midnight COL channel name VAL ifcopod COL description VAL Don't tell anyone  I'd probably prefer this Gorme  performance to any by Billie Holiday.though I have a sneaking affection for the soupy strings added by Our Man on Broadway  Ray Ellis to   Billie's two late albums. Billie was vaunted for her assimilation of  jazz instrumentalists in effect using her voice  plus vibrato  like a jazz soloist. Edyie Gorme and  husband Steve Lawrence  had stellar careers as popular song stylists backed by Don Costa  Orchestra when she recorded   in the 1950s for ABC Paramount. Their careers crossed  as well as threading  solo   paths..OK point taken Gorme is not a tragedienne as Holiday was  but then some are not overly flexed about tragedy in music. However the punch line in this   special  performance   comes  at the close of a wonderful vibrato laden styling. Edyie  underlining that singers of   this calibre just aint around  She  really  caps the proceedings with an amazingly held  smoky   closing note seems wonderfully to go on   and on  and on ~ sadly  interrupted by the  head honchos    monitoring  the recording  What a gang of philistines.. .One of the best  endings  you'll hear  from any singer  Gorme's interpretation worth it for this  alone.	0

COL title VAL Blowin' in the Wind COL performer VAL The Hollies	COL video title VAL Earl Bostic -- Bugle Call Rag (VintageMusic.es) COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm COL description VAL 1913 -- 1965 El saxo alto Earl Bostic fue un auténtico master de su instrumento\, a pesar de ser infravalorado por los aficionados al jazz a causa de sus grabaciones de estilo jump que hiciera durante los años 50s y 60s.  Nacido en Tulsa\, Oklahoma\, Eugene Earl Bostic\, tocó por el territorio del Medio Oeste a principios de los años 30. Estudió en la Xavier University\, e hizo giras con varias bandas antes de trasladarse a New York en 1938. En esa ciudad tocó con Don Redman y Lionel Hampton\, con quien grabó su primer disco en 1939.  A principios de los años 40\, Bostic trabajó como arreglista y músico de sesión y formó su primera banda en 1945\, empezando a grabar regularmente consiguiendo su primer hit en 1948 con la pieza "Temptation". Enseguida firmó con la discográfica King\, la casa de la mayoría de sus éxitos de los jukebox\, que habitualmente se caracterizaba por un fuerte driving y un contagioso ritmo beat\, servido por el potente sonido del alto de Bostic en su faceta más romántica o agresiva y bluesy  En 1951\, Bostic consiguió un numero uno en las listas de éxitos con "Flamingo" al que siguieron varios más\, como "Sleep"\, "You Go to My Head" y "Cherokee". Por los grupos de Bostic desfilaron muchos jóvenes jazzmen tales como John Coltrane\, Blue Mitchell\, Benny Golson\, Stanley Turrentine\, Jaki Byard y otros muchos. Desgraciadamente\, Bostic sufrió un ataque al corazón a finales de los años 50s\, que le apartó de la música durante dos años. Regresó en 1959 pero no grabó tan extensamente y las sesiones de los 60s fueron más de corte Soul Jazz que de R&B.  Bostic murió de un fatal ataque al corazón mientras tocaba en un hotel de Rochester\, New York.

She recorded both on the "JOAN" album in 1967 with baroque arranger Peter Schickele - within weeks of their appearence on Hardin`s second LP. She didn`t know him personally\, but his influence on the Greenwich Village scene was so immeasurbly profound that it`s no wonder she discovered his songs.  "Don`t Make Promises" was the first track on his first album for 1966."	0

COL title VAL Ya ya twist COL performer VAL Petula Clark	COL video title VAL François Glorieux plays The Beatles - 11 - In My Life (Debussy) COL channel name VAL François Miet COL description VAL Improvisation on "In my life" in the style of Claude Debussy. La plus grande originalité de cet étonnant LP réside sans doute dans le fait que chaque pièce a été entièrement improvisée. En d'autres termes : jouée spontanément sans préparation\, ni partition. Si François Glorieux est le seul pianiste de notre XXè siècle à s'être aventuré aussi loin dans le domaine de l'improvisation\, il ne révèle ici qu'UN des des multiples aspects de ce "grand art" qu'il pratique comme personne : l'improvisation de style. Et cela tient du miracle! Loin de se contenter d'un "pastiche à la manière de ..."\, il nous démontre comment les noms illustres de l'histoire de la musique auraient pu traiter les admirables mélodies des Beatles. Certains thèmes ont été reproduits intégralement\, d'autres ont été légèrement modifiés ou adaptés à l'image même du compositeur! Et on chercherait en vain un défaut de style ou de construction\, une faute de goût\, une lacune. Comme le disait si bien un critique musical allemand : " François Glorieux est en quelque sorte le faux-monnayeur de l'improvisation\, car c'est si parfait\, si réussi\, qu'on ne sait s'il joue le vrai ou le faux."	0
