"Tenderly" has been recorded by many famous artists\, but possibly the best-known version is by Rosemary Clooney. Her recorded version reached only #17 on the Billboard magazine pop charts in early 1952\, but is more popular than the chart data would suggest\, as is evidenced by the fact that Tenderly served as the theme song for Clooney's 1956-1957 TV variety show. It also became her signature song.  I consciously came to know of the song in the late 1970's while watching a Bing Crosby Special; Rosemary\, a guest star on the show\, sang it and it just took my breath away; I immediately realized that I had heard the song before\, and it brought vivid memories of my childhood and my mother. It is because of this that I made this video - A way to pay tribute to this great artist\, song and to the beautiful memory of my late mother. It is to her that I dedicate this song and I know she watches from a better place. COL channel name VAL boopkid	0

It was written about Jane Asher\, McCartney's girlfriend of five years\, "You don't look different\, but you have changed\," the lyrics declare\, reflecting his dissatisfaction with their relationship.  The Beatles recorded three versions of the song in October and November 1965. The original version recorded on 24 October was slower than the released version\, had a significantly different rhythm\, and lacked the "Why\, tell me why..." middle eight of the final version.  It was eventually released in 1996 on the Anthology 2 compilation.  The final version was recorded on 10 November with overdubs on 11 November and is the version included on Rubber Soul.      * Paul McCartney -- double-tracked vocal\, acoustic rhythm guitar\, bass\, lead guitar     * John Lennon -- harmony vocal\, acoustic rhythm guitar     * George Harrison -- guitar     * Ringo Starr -- drums\, tambourine\, Hammond organ  In other news\, I have added the lyrics to this song so you can sing along\, or perhaps learn the song!

COL title VAL Rocking Around the Christmas Tree COL performer VAL The Baseballs	COL video title VAL Beverly Kenney - That's All (Previously Unreleased Demo Session before Decca Records 1954) COL description VAL "That's All" is a 1952 song written by Alan Brandt and Bob Haymes. It has been covered by many jazz and blues artists. The song is part of the Great American Songbook. Nat King Cole first sang the song in 1953.   Beverly Kenney (January 29\, 1932\, Harrison\, New Jersey -- April 13\, 1960\, New York City) was an American jazz singer.  Kenney worked early in life for Western Union as a telephone birthday singer. After moving to New York City\, she recorded a demo in 1954 with Tony Tamburello; the demo was released in its entirety in 2006 by SSJ Records in 2006 under the title Snuggled on Your Shoulder and included the song "That's All". By the end of the year she had moved to Miami\, where she landed a recurring engagement at the Black Magic Room. Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey heard her and took her on tour in the orchestra they co-led; she worked with them for several months before breaking off to move back to New York. Upon her return\, she worked in clubs with George Shearing\, Don Elliott\, and Kai Winding; After a short tour of the Midwest with Larry Sonn\, she signed to Roost Records and released her first album in 1956. Her second release was Come Swing with Me\, and Jimmy Jones led an ensemble behind her for her third and final release for Roost in 1957.  Beverly moved to Decca Records\, and released three further LPs with them\, including Beverly Kenney Sings For Playboys (1958)\, Born to Be Blue (1959)\, and Like Yesterday (1959). Beverly Kenney Sings For Playboys featured liner notes by Steve Allen\, which praised Kenney's vocal style and stated\, "A word to Playboys: I would not recommend this album as Music to Make the Romantic Approach By. You're apt to get more interested in Beverly than the girl you're trying to impress."  Beverly was a critically acclaimed musician\, but she saw little widespread acceptance\, due at least in part to the burgeoning rock & roll movement. She had an intense personal dislike for this music\, even going so far as to compose a song called "I Hate Rock and Roll"\, which she performed on the Steve Allen Show on May 18\, 1958.  On April 13\, 1960\, Kenney committed suicide by an overdose of alcohol and Seconal. She was 28 years old. She remains a cult figure in Japan\, where all of her albums have been reissued to CD and have remained in print on a relatively steady basis. Japan's SSJ Records have released three collections of unreleased Beverly Kenney material: Snuggled on Your Shoulder (2006)\, Lonely and Blue (2007)\, and What Is There To Say? (2009). This first in the series\, Snuggled on Your Shoulder\, was reissued by Cellar Door Records in 2010; it features the SSJ Records release in its entirety plus bonus tracks from a recently discovered radio show. One track from Snuggled On Your Shoulder\, "Tea For Two"\, was released on the Vintage music compilation\, This is Vintage Now (2011).  Beverly's accompanied by Tony Tamburello on piano.  Again\, this is from her actual recording demo from 1954.  There are those\, I am sure\, who have told you They would give you the world for a toy All I have are these arms to enfold you And a love time can never destroy  I can only give you love that lasts forever And a promise to be near each time you call And a love who's burning light will warm the winter night  And That's all That's all  I can only give you country walks in springtime And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall And heart I call my own is yours and yours alone  And That's all That's all  There are those\, I am sure\, who have told you They would give you the world just for a toy All I have are these arms to enfold you With a love time can never destroy  If you're wondering what I'm asking in return\, dear You'll be so glad to know that my demands are small Say it's me that you'll adore for now and ever more  And That's all...

COL title VAL Downtown COL performer VAL Patty Duke	COL video title VAL Howard Roberts_All The Things You Are COL description VAL Personnel: Howard Roberts (guitar); Bill Holman (tenor saxophone); Pete Jolly (piano); Red Mitchell (bass guitar); Stan Levy (drums); Marty Paich.  West Coast guitarist Howard Roberts was something of an unsung hero of that area's jazz scene. Though his bop-influenced style of cool jazz was tremendously influential\, Roberts himself was content to spend the bulk of his career working mainly on the Los Angeles session circuit\, where one of his numerous recordings was the eerie theme to THE TWILIGHT ZONE. 1959's GOOD PICKIN'S is an early Roberts effort that finds him performing both original "head" arrangements and bop and pop standards like "Relaxin' At Camarillo" and "All the Things You Are." Demonstrating a fluid\, creative style\, as well as an obvious affinity for Charlie Parker\, Roberts moves easily from the bebop stylings of "Will You Still Be Mine" to the bluesy "Lover Man\," aided by the sympathetic accompaniment of his band\, which includes his longtime colleague\, pianist Pete Jolly\, and legendary bop drummer Stan Levey.

There have been several covers of the song (including The Birds and Saint Etienne in English) but the most known is probably the 1996 cover recording by the French artist Mylène Farmer and the French-born musician Khaled. The Farmer/Khaled cover was performed during Farmer's 1996 concert tour. After three live performances\, the song was finally released as the first single from Farmer's second live album\, Live à Bercy on 29 April 1997\, and became a top five hit in Belgium.  Background and live performances  There is a studio version of this duet\, but it was never released. This studio version was performed in lip-sync in a single television show\, Tip top\, broadcast on a French channel and host by Éric Jean-Jean\, where Farmer was invited to promote her single "Comme j'ai mal". Previously\, the show proposed to Farmer a list of singers with whom she would sing a song. She chose Khaled and decided to perform a cover of Polnareff's song\, "La Poupée qui fait non"\, and the recording lasted four hours.  Interviewed by the French magazine Instant-Mag\, Thierry Rogen\, the sound engineer who has participated in the recording\, said: "I have participated in the single "La Poupée qui fait non" with Khaled. Laurant [Boutonnat] was absent. The recording was made in the studio Merga in Suresnes in the right mood. It has been very rapid. Mylène [Farmer] and Khaled were together for four hours in total".  Farmer said she chose the song because it was the first song she learned when she was a child\, and she loved Michel Polnareff's work. Khaled also said: "This is a common idea\, we wanted to sing together. We loved both Polnareff. Personally\, I think it's the first song I learned."  The live version\, which was released in 1997\, was performed only three nights (two in Geneva and the last at Bercy) as a duet on stage during the 1996 tour. This remained the only collaboration between two artists.  The two remixes available on the CD maxi and the promotional vinyl were produced by Mylène Farmer (this is the only time she has participated in remixes of one of her singles)\, in collaboration with Thierry Rogen. However\, these remixes have not been well appreciated by the singer's fans\, because almost all the words have disappeared.  When the song was released\, Khaled declared that he found Farmer very sympathetic.[8] However\, later\, he said he had felt used by her\, since she put herself forward all the time when they performed the song and were interviewed; according to a 2009 edition of Nouvel Observateur\, Khaled qualified this collaboration as a "trap".  Critical reception  The song generally received negative reviews. According to the author Erwan Chuberre\, the duo Khaled / Farmer "which blends the sun and the darkness is on the limit of credibility". "The two worlds [of both singers] really failed to merge and this cover is soon forgotten!" Instant-Mag considered as "absurd" the fact that the studio version was never released\, and found that the song "was much harmed by the remixes that accompany it\, in which we have as the hazy impression that Mylène was amused herself (and without supervision) to press the buttons on the console of Thierry Rogen".  In France\, the single debuted at a peak of number six on 3 May 1997. However\, like Farmer's previous top ten hits\, it dropped rather quickly and fell off the top 50 after eight weeks.  Surprisingly\, the song was a big success in Belgium\, where it had a better chart trajectory in the Ultratop 40 than in France. It appeared on the chart for a total of 18 weeks from 24 May 1997\, peaked at number five on 21 June\, and managed to remain for eight weeks in the top ten. The song ranked at number 41 in the End of year chart. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

COL title VAL Da var det schäferen beit COL performer VAL Vazelina Bilopphøggers	COL video title VAL Maggie Bell - Wishing Well COL description VAL Suicide Sal - 1975  The success of Angel Air's series of Maggie Bell reissues can be easily judged by the Scottish singer's return to the U.K. after residing for years abroad\, a planned autobiography\, and her intention of touring. Although critically feted in the U.K.\, Bell\, both solo and with her former band Stone the Crows\, never quite achieved the commercial breakthrough everyone had so expected. Always a bridesmaid\, never a bride\, Bell's recording career was punctuated by a sole Stone the Crows charting album. With that band's demise in 1973\, the soul singer went solo\, releasing the (again) critically acclaimed Queen of the Night album\, with 1975's Suicide Sal following. A tougher\, more energized set than its predecessor\, Sal's electrifying live feel reflects the incendiary stage shows Bell and her new backing band had been playing in the intervening time between recordings. The two bonus tracks\, recorded at a gig later that year\, capture their live ferocity. Intriguingly\, the funky\, fiery title track\, an homage to Bell's Aunt\, a music hall star\, is one of only two originals on this set. The second\, the lavishly bluesy "If You Don't Know" was penned by band keyboardist Pete Wingfield\, and boasts a guesting Jimmy Page on guitar. The storming "Coming on Strong" also has a Bell connection\, being co-penned by ex-Crow Colin Allen and Zoot Money. The rest of the album comprises astutely chosen covers drawn from an eclectic selection of artists. One of the standouts is "It's Been So Long\," a powerful gospel number written by the Pretty Things' Phil May\, who not only rewrote some of the lyrics for Bell\, but added his backing vocals to the song. Free's classic "Wishing Well" gets a sensational workout\, while that band's offshoot Kossoff\, Kirke\, Tetsu & Rabbit's "Hold On" is taken to new emotive heights. From barrelling Beatles pop to the Sutherland Brothers poignant Gaelic ode\, from ballads to hefty rock & roll\, Bell struts across this set with style and such assurance\, that even Aunt Sal must have been impressed. One of Britain's greatest soul singers\, showcased at her best\, this magnificent album also includes an excellent\, expansive biography of this crucial artist.

COL title VAL The Wonder of You COL performer VAL Whistle Bait	COL video title VAL Toy Factory - Summertime (1970) COL description VAL Banda: Toy Factory Album: ST (1970) Origem: Estados Unidos Gravadora: AVCO Embassy - AVLP 7014   Though we haven't been able to track down much bibliographical information on this late-60s bi-racial outfit\, we think they were from Long Island\, New York. From the liner notes on their LP we can also tell you Greg Weiss was the lead singer and was responsible for writing roughly half the material. The rest of the line up consisted of bassist Bill\, guitarist Billy\, drummer Joey and keyboard player Sal (great detail there). Produced by Bernie Lawrence\, the majority of 1970's "Toy Factory" found the band trying to fight their way through rather faceless MOR pop. Lead singer Greg Weiss had a decent voice\, but on tracks such as "What Is Youth"\, "To Live or Die" and "Honey\, Forever" he employed an irritating faux-English accent that recalled Davy Jones (he sounds like David Hemmings to me Bad Cat!!!). He also had an irritating habit of throwing mock sobs and groans into the mix ("When I'm with You" and "Honey Forever"). Strike three were the occasional French lyrics (don't pick on the French Bad Cat!!!) he tossed into the mix ("To Live or Die" and "Honey Forever"). Curiously\, the band was at their best when they cut loose and go for a harder rock sound. In this case\, the pseudo-psychedelic "No Rhyme To Orange" (sporting a nice fuzz guitar solo) and "Things" was a nifty slice of blue-eyed soul. "Summertime" also found the band turning in one of the weirdest George Gershwin covers we've ever heard (pretty decent guitar here too Bad Cat!!!). This one certainly won't change your life\, but it's one of those period failures that's worth checking out. (Tyme Machine Blog) COL channel name VAL Melomano Discos	0

COL title VAL Fling Thing COL performer VAL AC/DC	COL video title VAL Freddy Weller "Save The Last Dance For Me" COL description VAL Folks who are pretty familiar with my channel are probably familiar with what I call the "51 West Treatment"\, 51 West being an early 80's label that had the habit of picking up artists past their commercial prime and having them record albums full of cover hits. Sometimes the results were great\, sometimes bad. Freddy's (for some reason "Freddie" on the album cover) 1982 "Ramblin' Man" is actually somewhere in the middle for me. It's not bad\, but it's not great either. One of the more likable tracks to me was this one\, and he does a fine job with it! Enjoy! COL channel name VAL wilburscott	0

L'auteur de L'écume des jours a su trouver les mots qui sonnent avec grâce. La direction musicale de Laurent De Wild est un "Voyage au Paradis".  Libération -- 2009 -- Bruno Pfeiffer -- Diane chante Vian tel que -- Un météore a explosé la surface tranquille de la lune : son dernier disque "Docteur Boris et Mister Vian". Le travail enduit de baume les oreilles\, puis le reste de la carcasse. C'est tout simplement extra... Un régal. Vian n'aurait sans doute pas hésité à applaudir « Rue de la flemme ». Quel concentré de swing relâché! Quel modèle de grande chanson (tour de force de la traduction)! Pourquoi  citer seulement  le savoureux « Voyage au Paradis » ? Les onze valent le coup. Le disque passe comme un remède à l'imbécillité de la période actuelle... La profondeur légère de l'interprétation s'offre comme un cadeau. Les chorus de Laurent de Wilde\, huit ou seize mesures maxi\, ne goinfrent pas la mise en place. La complicité de l'ensemble se ressent du respect flagrant que se portent les artistes. Le prochain qui me classe Diane Tell dans la variété\, je l'enjoins : jazzons les idées préconçues.

TESTO DELLA CANZONE E BIOGRAFIA DELL'INTERPRETE  TESTO: Tornerai / da me perché l'unico sogno sei / del mio cuor. Tornerai / tu perché senza i tuoi baci languidi / non vivrò. Ho qui dentro ognor la tua voce che dice / tremando "amor". Tornerò / perché tuo è il mio cuor.  Tu sai che t'amo: / non ho che te mi stai lontano: / dimmi perché? La nostalgia / non senti in cuor? Non ti ricordi di me? Questa mia vita / non può durar\, tu sei fuggita / devi tornar: questo mio cuor / ti vuole ancor.  Tornerò / perché tuo è il mio cuor.  BIOGRAFIA (da ildiscobolo.net)  Si chiamava il realtà Guido Di Luca ed era nato a Livorno nel 1903. Dopo una attivissima carriera radiofonica (fu tra l'altro in radio uno dei tre moschettieri nella celebre rubrica degli anni '30) e discografica che lo videro incidere decine di 78 giri  prevalentemente per la Parlophon quando questa etichetta era in Italia prodotta e distribuita dalla Cetra.   Emigrò negli anni cinquanta negli Stati Uniti \, ove continuò a lavorare come attore\, spesso affiancato da nomi molto noti dello spettacolo americano. Morì \, proprio negli USA nel 1991.   Fu tra l'altro il marito della nota attrice Lilla Brignone\, scomparsa nel 1984\, conosciuta proprio alla radio durante la lavorazione di una delle tante commedie radiofoniche ale quali partecipò.   Molte le incisioni da lui realizzate affiancato dal Trio delle sorelle Lescano : Balliamo il passo Lambeth Bimba mia non mi resistere Casetta mia Disillusione Giovanotti Girotondo dell'amore Il maestro innamorato La ragazza del giornale Ladro d'amore Son tutte belle Un anno di baci Un po' di sole Una ninna-nanna COL channel name VAL Melodieantiche	1

COL title VAL The Word COL performer VAL Rob Agerbeek	COL video title VAL Bettye LaVette - The Word (Amazing Beatles Cover) COL description VAL Bettye turned the Beatles "The Word" into a stomping funk workout that bears only a tangential relationship to the original recording on Rubber Soul. She opens the song with the verse instead of the chorus. When she gets to the chorus\, she deploys two simultaneous parts\, rhythmically chanting "say it" while the background singers declaim a facsimile of what the Beatles originally sang. After a minute and a half\, she dispenses with what the Beatles had written\, spending the final two minutes funkifying her way through a kaleidoscope of sections involving James Brown like rhythmic declamations of vocals\, various permutations of the chorus\, a complete and sudden break and instrumental vamps. The result is a stunning revisioning of a song that most of us have had burned into our brains for almost 50 years! COL channel name VAL Steve Cabral	1

It has a twelve bar blues progression\, using only three chords until the coda.  In addition to Neal Hefti's original version\, and the television soundtrack version by Nelson Riddle\, versions were covered by The Marketts (single "Batman Theme" and album The Batman Theme by The Marketts)\, The Ventures (The Ventures Play the "Batman" Theme\, Dolton BST8042\, 3/1966)\, Al Hirt\, The Standells and actor/musician David McCallum.  The song has been widely parodied in the decades since its debut. The theme has been re-recorded by dozens of artists\, including Link Wray\, Voivod\, The Jam\, and The Who.  Adaptations  Jan & Dean on their 1966 album\, Jan And Dean Meet Batman. The Who recorded a cover of the theme in 1966.  The Kinks played a cover of the theme at their show at Kelvin Hall\, Glasgow\, in 1967. Adrian Henri and his band Liverpool Scene did a skit of the theme in the late 60s using Henri's poem Batpoem. The Jam covered the "Batman Theme" on their debut album\, In the City in 1977. In 1966\, an album called Batman and Robin: The Sensational Guitars of Dan and Dale was released featuring members of the Sun Ra Arkestra and The Blues Project. The opening track is a cover of the "Batman Theme". Prince and R.E.M. used variations of the TV show theme in their work: Prince in the song "Batdance" (which appeared on the soundtrack to Tim Burton's 1989 movie)\, and R.E.M. in a rejected song for the Batman Returns soundtrack\, later released under the title "Winged Mammal Theme"\, as a B-side to the single "Drive". Voivod did a cover on their 1988 Dimension Hatröss album. Disciplina kicme did a cover on their album Najlepši hitovi! Uživo (1987). John Zorn\, led off his Naked City album on YouTube with a version of Batman (1990). The Well Paid Scientists produced an acid techno remix entitled To The Batrave......Let's Go in 1998. According to Ritchie Blackmore\, the main riff in "Space Truckin'" by the English rock band Deep Purple is based on the "Batman Theme". Snoop Dogg sampled the Batman Theme for his song "Batman & Robin" on the album Paid tha Cost to Be da Boss (2002). COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

COL title VAL A Taste Of Honey COL performer VAL Chet Atkins	COL video title VAL Bonnie Dobson - A taste of honey COL description VAL from the album 'Good Morning Rain' in 1970   By the time she moved permanently to London in 1970\, Canadian Bonnie Dobson had a pretty susbtantial career under her belt: four albums on the Prestige label including the song for which shes best known (Walk me out in the) Morning Dew plus two on RCA Victor.  Born in Toronto in 1940\, she got into folk seriously as a teenager on summer camps where people like Pete Seeger and Leon Bibb would turn up to give concerts. She got her break in 1960\, left university and started touring in the States.  I did my first tour with Brownie McGee and Sonny Terry who had been my idols and then I was playing with them\, she recalled in 1993. And then I went off to Los Angeles. There was a festival up in Idlewild\, the University of California had this arts festival every summer and I taught Canadian folk songs. I never got back to University. I just kept going and eventually I hit New York.  Grief over theft What followed were those six albums\, years of touring and lots of grief over her song Morning Dew being stolen by Tim Rose. In November 1969 she made her London debut at the Queen Elizabeth Hall\, and settled in the city the following year.   Lost Ladies of Folk She recorded just this one album for Argo\, then one for Polydor in 1976 (Morning Dew)\, followed by a few singles in the early eighties. Since then its been pretty much reissues\, retrospectives and compilations.  She had in fact called it quits I didnt feel I was growing\, I didnt feel I was doing anything. I just seemed to be doing the same things over and over again and I thought some people are happy to do that\, I wasnt. So I thought Ill go back and get my degree. Once back in the university world\, she stayed\, working as an administrator in the Philosophy Department of Birkbeck College\, London.  In 2007\, 28 years after she made her UK debut there\, she was persuaded back on to the stage at Queen Elizabeth Hall by Jarvis Cocker\, who was running a Lost Ladies of Folk night as part of his Meltdown curatorship. By all accounts she was on fine form. COL channel name VAL andrijadragon	1

COL title VAL Red Hot COL performer VAL Robert Gordon with Link Wray	COL video title VAL 1920s Chicago Jazz: Jimmie Noone's Apex Club Orch. - I Know That You Know COL description VAL Jimmie Noone's Apex Club Orchestra (Jimmie Noone\, clarinet; Joe Poston alto sax; Earl Hines\, piano; Buddy Scott\, banjo; Johnny Wells\, drums) -- I Know That You Know (V.Youmans /A.Caldwell)\, Brunswick 1937 (Originally recorded by Vocalion\, 1928)   NOTE: Jimmie NOONE (b.1895 Cut Off\, Louisiana -- d. 1944 in LA\, California) American jazz clarinetist who is regarded as one of the greatest jazz clarinetists\, along with Johnny Dodds\, Benny Goodman and Sidney Bechet. Noone's playing is lyrical and sophisticated\, and certainly makes more use of "sweet" flavoring. Noone was an important influence on later clarinetists such as Artie Shaw and Benny Goodman. He started playing guitar in his home town and at the age of 15\, he switched to the clarinet and moved to New Orleans. He studied with Lorenzo Tio and with the young Sidney Bechet\, who was only 13 at the time. By 1912\, he was playing professionally with Kid Ory\, Papa Celestin\, the Eagle Band before joining the Original Creole Orchestra in Chicago in 1917. The following year\, he joined King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band\, then in 1926\, he started leading the band at Chicago's Apex Club\, the Jimmie Noone's Apex Club Orchestra\, in which the influential pianist Earl Hines was playing for a time. In  1943 he moved to Los Angeles\, where he died suddenly of a heart attack. The Kid Ory's band played for him the blues titled "Blues for Jimmie" on the radio\, and the number eventually became a regular feature for the Ory band. COL channel name VAL 240252	0

COL title VAL Heroes COL performer VAL Scott Bradlee's Postmodern Jukebox feat. Nicole Atkins	COL video title VAL Sometimes I'm Happy COL description VAL O timbre aveludado e as interpretações delicadas da paulistana Marcia Lopes\, vem despertando reações calorosas de quem a ouve. Foi assim com Caetano Veloso\, Lulu Santos e até Bill Clinton\, que a acompanhou no sax durante uma reunião musical. Marcia estréia com estilo cantando um repertório de MPB mesclado com canções em inglês\, todo ele escolhido com muito critério pela própria cantora e arranjado com igual competência por Roberto Sion. Em português\, canções de Chico Buarque\, Edu Lobo\, Cristóvão Bastos\, Sueli Costa e Caetano Veloso. Em inglês\, Cole Porter\, James Taylor e Irving Ceasar. “Marcia parece que nasceu com a música. A emissão é muito calma\, muito límpida e tudo nas interpretações dela dá a impressão de boa música\, sem esforço\, tranqüila. A primeira coisa que a voz dela faz é produzir a nota. Isso é bom. Dá uma felicidade para quem está ouvindo. Fiquei realmente impressionado com a afinação precisa e o perfeito senso de medida em suas interpretações.

COL title VAL You're Sixteen COL performer VAL Johnny Cymbal	COL video title VAL Billy Vaughn -- Theme from Mr Lucky COL description VAL Richard "Billy Vaughn" (el 12 de abril de 1919 - el 26 de septiembre de 1991) era un cantante\, multiinstrumentista\, y líder de orquesta. Él nació en Glasgow\, Kentucky\, donde su padre era un barbero que amó la música e inspiró a Billy y le enseñó  tocar la mandolina a la edad de 3 años cuando padecía  un caso de la sarampión. Él continuó aprendiendo varios otros instrumentos.  En 1941 Vaughn se afilió a la Guardia Nacional de los Estados Unidos para lo que había sido preparado como una cesión de un año\, pero cuando la Segunda Guerra Mundial estalló\, le enviaron al extranjero hasta el final la guerra  en 1945.  Él decidió hacer de la música su carrera cuando él fue licenciado del ejército al final de guerra\, y asistió al Colegio de Estado de Kentucky Occidental\, ahora conocido como la Universidad de Kentucky Occidental.  Mientras él estaba un estudiante allí\, otros tres compañeros\, Jimmy Sacca\, Donald McGuire\, y Seymour Spiegelman\, que habían formado un trío vocal\, el Hilltoppers\, reclutaron a Vaughn para tocar el piano con ellos. Él pronto añadió su voz \, convirtiendo el trío en un cuarteto. Como  miembro del grupo\, él también escribió su primera canción \, Tentativa\, que charted en 1952.  En 1954 dejó el grupo para afiliarse a Archivos de Punto en Gallatin\, Tennessee como el director de música. Posteriormente formó su propia orquesta\, y tuvo un gran éxito en aquel mismo año "con la Melodía del Amor." Continuó cosechando éxitos  durante la próxima década y media. Vaughn murió del cáncer en Palomar\, California el 26 de septiembre\, { El 26 de septiembre} 1991.

TESTO DELLA CANZONE E BIOGRAFIA DELL'INTERPRETE  TESTO: Un bacio ti domando ma tu non dici quando. tu sempre mi rispondi: "chissa'\, chissa'\, chissa'..." ed ogni di' che passa\, cosi' mi fai soffrire\, perche' non fai che dire: "chissa'\, chissa'\, chissa'..." per te io mi tormento pensando\, pensando. aspetto che tu m'ami\, non so quando\, non so quando. ed ogni di' che passa così\, mi fai soffrire\, perche' non fai che dire: "chissa'\, chissa'\, chissa'..."

BIOGRAFIA (da Wikipedia): Entra all'EIAR vincendo il secondo concorso per voci nuove Gara nazionale per gli artisti della canzone\, indetto dall'ente radiofonico nel 1939\, esordendo nel 1940 insieme a Silvana Fioresi nell'orchestra Angelini e proseguendo poi in quelle di Pippo Barzizza\, Carlo Zeme e Beppe Mojetta. Allo stesso periodo risalgono le prime incisioni\, realizzate per la Cetra; nel 1947 incide le canzoni Abbasso le donne e La luna e sei soldi\, tratte dalle colonne sonore dei rispettivi omonimi film. Dotato di una voce baritonale lievemente rauca\, canta anche in orchestre di jazz\, esibendosi spesso con il noto chitarrista Michele Ortuso; il successo continua per tutto il decennio\, finché\, nel 1952 si trasferisce in Sudamerica a seguito di un ingaggio cinematografico; lì continua l'attività sino al periodo a cavallo tra gli anni settanta ed ottanta\, quando\, dopo essersi esibito ancora con successo per lungo tempo nei ritrovi più prestigiosi del Venezuela\, si ritira a Caracas. Nel 2006 il regista Pasquale Pozzessere ha inserito\, nella colonna sonora della miniserie televisiva La provinciale\, la canzone La ragazza del ritmo\, della quale Donà\, oltre che interprete\, è stato anche autore del testo e della musica. Tra i suoi motivi più famosi\, si ricordano: Venezia\, la luna e tu\, Buonanotte Brasil\, Bocca nel buio\, La danza dello scoiattolo\, Il tamburo della banda d'Affori (una delle sue canzoni più note\, scritta da Mario Panzeri)\, Serenata ad un angelo\, Ballerina\, Botta e risposta\, Suona balalaika e Tarantella d'amore.

COL title VAL I'm Just a Lucky So and So COL performer VAL Ron Kaplan	COL video title VAL Gunter Noris and His Orchestra -  Swanee COL description VAL It was George Gershwin's very first "hit" and his biggest selling song : "Swanee".  The critics of the 1920's described the song as "infectious" and that actually was (and still is) a quite accurate description of this captivating tune.  The name linked forever to the song is that of Al Jolson who made the song a worldwide success but some people may also remember Judy Garland's version which was more extravert and outspoken than Jolson's "classic" interpretation. Here Gunter Noris captures the song's infectiousness by adding a pleasant sounding beat while bearing in mind the sound of the "golden twenties" as well. From the Album "Plays Gershwin" here's Gunter Noris and His Orchestra taking you back in time with Gershwin's "Swanee".  Enjoy. COL channel name VAL Socratess2007	0

It was written by Ferdinand Washington and Don Robey (of Duke Records)\, not Johnny Ace himself.  At this stage in his career Huey Meaux was trying various musical suits on Roy to see what might catch the public ear. This was the country Roy announced by the pedal steel as soon as the record starts.  This\, and other tracks\, come from the album "Country Crooner" which was issued in 1999 on Edsel as one of their Crazy Cajun series of albums which pulled together recordings produced by Huey P Meaux in Houston in the late '60's and '70's. Meaux used the Crazy Cajun name for one of a series of labels which he operated in the timeframe.  Roy Head had his one and only hit for Huey Meaux in 1965 with "Treat Her Right" which is rightly regarded as a classic of blue-eyed soul.  For a variety of reasons Roy didn't manage to follow this record up successfully. He drifted between labels until he came under control of Meaux again in\, I think\, the mid seventies. Two albums were issued of his music\, "Boogie Down" and "Rock'n'Roll My Soul". Edsel issued two albums in 1999 covering music from those albums\, the aforementioned "Country Crooner" and "White Texas Soul Shouter". I assume Edsel's intention was to cover the more soul and R&B oriented in the latter and the C&W ones in the former. The recordings themselves were apparently spread over a wide period from the late '60's through to the mid '70's.   The musicians present on most of these tracks were:  Dahrull Norris - Drums Ira Wilkes - Bass Peter Schless - Keyboards\, Synthesiser Lee O'Neil - Keyboards\, Synthesiser\, Arrangements Mike Pietzsch - Guitar Uncle Mickey Moody - Guitar\, Arrangements Lynn Groom - Guitar The Merlene Singers - Background vocals COL channel name VAL DangerousDaveRR	0

Their innovative brass sound introduced British youth to soul music. Within three months of Epstein's management\, the band had their first UK hit single with "One Way Love" and a tour of Germany with The Beatles. They were the first British band to be signed to the Motown label.   Cliff crowned his success with the Rebel Rousers in 1966 with a song written exclusively for him by Lennon & McCartney - "Got To Get You Into My Life" which reached No. 3 in the UK charts\, creating a unique British soul sound. Their other hits include: "Back In the USSR"\, "One Way Love" and "I'll Take You Home"   On June 24\, 1966 Bennett & the Rebel Rousers opened up for the Beatles at the Circus Krone-Bau concert in Munich\, Germany.  In this clip the band does "C C Rider."  BTW ... The Rebel Rousers are using the drums from the Rattles\, another group playing at that show.

A founding member of the group was Dionne Warwick\, who was later replaced by her aunt\, Cissy Houston. The Sweet Inspirations was founded by former members of The Drinkard Singers\, a long-running Gospel singing group whose membership included Cissy Houston (née Drinkard\, and mother of Whitney Houston\, 1963) and Lee Warwick\, who was Cissy's sister and the mother of Sweet Inspirations members Dee Dee and Dionne Warwick). As a backup group\, the Sweet Inspirations were in high demand among producers\, publishers\, artists\, and songwriters in the early 1960s. The original lineup included Doris Troy and the two Warwick sisters Dionne & Dee Dee. Sylvia Shemwell (sister of Judy Clay) replaced Troy\, while Cissy Houston took over from Dionne\, with Dee Dee Warwick as the group's official leader. The group sang backup for many stars\, including Solomon Burke\, Aretha Franklin\, Wilson Pickett\, and Esther Phillips. Dee Dee left in 1965\, when her solo career began to take off. She was replaced by Myrna Smith. Estelle Brown joined the team soon after\, and the line-up that was to become an Atlantic recording group was set. The Sweet Inspirations recorded by themselves for the first time in April 1967 for Atlantic Records. That session produced the first two singles released by Atlantic\, a version of "Why (Am I Treated So Bad)\," a song previously recorded by The Staple Singers and a soulful version of "Let It Be Me"\, a French song which had been a pop and R&B hit for Betty Everett & Jerry Butler in 1964.

Peace be unto her..... - Originally uploaded in my previous channel (65Reasons) on June 16\, 2008. It is being re-uploaded with some updates... - "The Way of Love" Composer: Jacques Dieval English Lyrics: Al Stillman   The lyricist for the French version "J'ai le mal de toi" is Michel Rivegauche.  The song was originally written in French under the name 'J'ai le mal de toi' and recorded by Lili Castel for the song competition "Musik Ohne Grenzen" on the Belgian radio (BRT).   The French lyrics were written by Michel Rivgauche.   In 1965\, it was released as a single by Kathy Kirby in English. Curiously\, while this single failed to chart in her native United Kingdom\, where Kirby placed several singles on the charts in the mid-60's\, it became her only song to place on Billboard Hot 100. The song's lyrics were penned from a male point of view. Kirby's rendition does not change the perspective\, creating a story in which the subject to whom she sings has left her for a male.  "The Way of Love" was later recorded by Cher. Her version hit number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 in February 1972.   - Enjoy! - COL channel name VAL 65Seasons	0

COL title VAL I'll Never Love This Way Again COL performer VAL Dionne Warwick	COL video title VAL Delaney and Bonnie - "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'" (Genesis LP) COL description VAL by Delaney & Bonnie. From the "Genesis" LP  For an album that is clearly a compilation of older material meant to capitalize on the fame from Delaney & Bonnie's 1971 hits on Atco\, The "Genesis" LP is a true find! There are only three tracks from the duo\, all produced by Leon Russell; the nine other titles are Delaney Bramlett solo\, six produced by Jackie DeShannon\, three others with no producer credited. Despite the slight deception -- that this is a Delaney Bramlett album with three bonus tracks by the hit group -- the disc still works on its own. DeShannon has Delaney sounding like Gene Pitney on "Tomorrow Never Comes\," while "Heartbreak Hotel" and Ray Charles' "I Got a Woman" have him emulating Elvis. On the uncredited production of "Lonely Me\," Mr. Bramlett goes for an early John Lennon vocal style\, then veers off to Gerry and the Pacemakers territory on his originals\, "Without Your Love" and "Better Man Than Me\," quite revealing in that they are so different from the music Jimmy Miller produced for the group when Delaney & Bonnie on Tour With Eric Clapton emerged. Jackie DeShannon's pop production kicks in again with "Liverpool Lou\," and it is back to that Gene Pitney sound. COL channel name VAL BobSeger1981	0

COL title VAL Blues in the Night COL performer VAL Ledisi	COL video title VAL Shirley Bassey - Blues In The Night (1957 Recording) COL description VAL 1957 (A young Shirley Bassey recorded this Johnny Mercer / Harold Arlen American Songbook Standard back in 1956 and it was released as a track on her first LP in 1957.  One of the songs from this LP\, 'Born To Sing The Blues' was released as a single in 1956.  Shirley has recorded & performed many genre's of music over her past 60+ years in show business due to her powerful voice & musical instincts\, but jazz & the blues were among the first that she mastered.  ABOUT this song: "Blues in the Night" is a popular song which has become a pop standard and is generally considered to be part of the Great American Songbook. The music was written by Harold Arlen\, the lyrics by Johnny Mercer\, for a 1941 film begun with the working title Hot Nocturne\, but finally released as Blues in the Night. The song is sung in the film by William Gillespie.  Arlen and Mercer wrote the entire score for the 1941 film Blues in the Night. One requirement was for a blues song to be sung in a jail cell. As usual with Mercer\, the composer wrote the music first\, then Mercer wrote the words. Arlen said\,   The whole thing just poured out. And I knew in my guts\, without even thinking what Johnny would write for a lyric\, that this was strong\, strong\, strong! When Mercer wrote "Blues in the Night"\, I went over his lyric and I started to hum it over his desk. It sounded marvelous once I got to the second stanza but that first twelve was weak tea. On the third or fourth page of his work sheets I saw some lines—one of them was "My momma done tol' me\, when I was in knee pants." I said\, "Why don't you try that?" It was one of the very few times I've ever suggested anything like that to John.  When they finished writing the song\, Mercer called a friend\, singer Margaret Whiting\, and asked if they could come over and play it for her. She suggested they come later because she had dinner guests—Mickey Rooney\, Judy Garland\, Mel Tormé\, and Martha Raye. Instead\, Arlen and Mercer went right over. Margaret Whiting remembered what happened then:   They came in the back door\, sat down at the piano and played the score of "Blues in the Night". I remember forever the reaction. Mel got up and said\, "I can't believe it." Martha couldn't say a word. Mickey Rooney said\, "That's the greatest thing I've ever heard." Judy Garland said\, "Play it again." We had them play it seven times. Judy and I ran to the piano to see who was going to learn it first. It was a lovely night.  A few of the great singers/musicians from the past who recorded this song were Ella Fitzgerald\, Frank Sinatra\, Rosemary Clooney\, Dinah Shore\, Judy Garland\, Bing Crosby\, Woody Herman\, Louis Armstrong\, Jo Stafford\, Doris Day\, Billy Eckstine\, Julie London\, Cab Calloway\, Kate Smith\, Van Morrison\, The Group Chicago\, and of course\, Shirley who was a teenager when she recorded it.   A few of the younger generation artists who have recorded this song include Amy Winehouse\, Eva Cassidy\, and Katie Melua.  ALL versions are Great\, because the song itself is a Classic for ALL generations!  LYRICS: My mama done tol' me\, when I was in pig tails My mama done tol' me\, " Child a man'll sweet talk" And give ya the big eye\, but when the sweet talkin's done A man is a two-face\, A worrisome thing who'll leave ya to sing the blues in the night  Now the rain's a-fallin'\, hear the train's a-callin\, "Whooee!" (My mama done tol' me) Hear dat lonesome whistle blowin' 'cross the trestle\, "Whooee!" (My mama done tol' me) A-whooee-ah-whooee ol' clickety-clack's a-echoin' back th' blues in the night  The evenin' breeze'll start the trees to cryin' and the moon'll hide its light when you get the blues in the night Take my word\, the mockingbird'll sing the saddest kind o' song\, he knows things are wrong\, and he's right  From Natchez to Mobile\, from Memphis to St. Joe\, wherever the four winds blow I been in some big towns an' heard me some big talk\, but there is one thing I know A man is a two-face\, a worrisome thing who'll leave ya to sing the blues in the night  Special Thanks to Pieter and Astrid from the Shirley Bassey blog and all those who have provided wonderful pictures of Shirley!

There have been several covers of the song (including The Birds and Saint Etienne in English) but the most known is probably the 1996 cover recording by the French artist Mylène Farmer and the French-born musician Khaled. The Farmer/Khaled cover was performed during Farmer's 1996 concert tour. After three live performances\, the song was finally released as the first single from Farmer's second live album\, Live à Bercy on 29 April 1997\, and became a top five hit in Belgium.  Background and live performances  There is a studio version of this duet\, but it was never released. This studio version was performed in lip-sync in a single television show\, Tip top\, broadcast on a French channel and host by Éric Jean-Jean\, where Farmer was invited to promote her single "Comme j'ai mal". Previously\, the show proposed to Farmer a list of singers with whom she would sing a song. She chose Khaled and decided to perform a cover of Polnareff's song\, "La Poupée qui fait non"\, and the recording lasted four hours.  Interviewed by the French magazine Instant-Mag\, Thierry Rogen\, the sound engineer who has participated in the recording\, said: "I have participated in the single "La Poupée qui fait non" with Khaled. Laurant [Boutonnat] was absent. The recording was made in the studio Merga in Suresnes in the right mood. It has been very rapid. Mylène [Farmer] and Khaled were together for four hours in total".  Farmer said she chose the song because it was the first song she learned when she was a child\, and she loved Michel Polnareff's work. Khaled also said: "This is a common idea\, we wanted to sing together. We loved both Polnareff. Personally\, I think it's the first song I learned."  The live version\, which was released in 1997\, was performed only three nights (two in Geneva and the last at Bercy) as a duet on stage during the 1996 tour. This remained the only collaboration between two artists.  The two remixes available on the CD maxi and the promotional vinyl were produced by Mylène Farmer (this is the only time she has participated in remixes of one of her singles)\, in collaboration with Thierry Rogen. However\, these remixes have not been well appreciated by the singer's fans\, because almost all the words have disappeared.  When the song was released\, Khaled declared that he found Farmer very sympathetic.[8] However\, later\, he said he had felt used by her\, since she put herself forward all the time when they performed the song and were interviewed; according to a 2009 edition of Nouvel Observateur\, Khaled qualified this collaboration as a "trap".  Critical reception  The song generally received negative reviews. According to the author Erwan Chuberre\, the duo Khaled / Farmer "which blends the sun and the darkness is on the limit of credibility". "The two worlds [of both singers] really failed to merge and this cover is soon forgotten!" Instant-Mag considered as "absurd" the fact that the studio version was never released\, and found that the song "was much harmed by the remixes that accompany it\, in which we have as the hazy impression that Mylène was amused herself (and without supervision) to press the buttons on the console of Thierry Rogen".  In France\, the single debuted at a peak of number six on 3 May 1997. However\, like Farmer's previous top ten hits\, it dropped rather quickly and fell off the top 50 after eight weeks.  Surprisingly\, the song was a big success in Belgium\, where it had a better chart trajectory in the Ultratop 40 than in France. It appeared on the chart for a total of 18 weeks from 24 May 1997\, peaked at number five on 21 June\, and managed to remain for eight weeks in the top ten. The song ranked at number 41 in the End of year chart. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

COL title VAL Talk to Me\, Talk to Me COL performer VAL Jean Du Shon	COL video title VAL I Didn't Know What Time It Was - Cassandra Wilson COL description VAL I was searching through the YouTube archives for tunes from Cassandra Wilson's 1988 album\, "Blue Skies"\, and I was surprised to find so very few posted here. I first thought that it must be because of some contractual conflict but when I discovered that wasn't the case\, I became downright stunned. By just about anyone's account\, Ms. Wilson's Blue Skies album is considered a masterpiece. Every tune from it is well played by the musicians and what Cass does with the lyrics to songs that have been sung by virtually all of the great jazz singers is something of a revelation. She manages to make all of the tunes seem brand new and never before heard. I think one of the best examples of that is this masterful handling of Rodgers and Hart's "I Didn't Know What Time It Was". While Terri Lyne Carrington keeps a steady fire beneath her\, Cass swings the tune\, beginning and ending some sung phrases with delightful little scats. She then breaks into a fully improvised scat right before Mulgrew Miller scorches us with his highly inventive solo. Special mention should also be made of rock-steady Lonnie Plaxico's bass work throughout\, always vibrant and swinging. I could have chosen any tune from the album to provide as an example of the album's fineness so don't settle on hearing just this tune. If you love jazz\, you've got to cop Cassandra Wilson's "Blue Skies".

Their innovative brass sound introduced British youth to soul music. Within three months of Epstein's management\, the band had their first UK hit single with "One Way Love" and a tour of Germany with The Beatles. They were the first British band to be signed to the Motown label.   Cliff crowned his success with the Rebel Rousers in 1966 with a song written exclusively for him by Lennon & McCartney - "Got To Get You Into My Life" which reached No. 3 in the UK charts\, creating a unique British soul sound. Their other hits include: "Back In the USSR"\, "One Way Love" and "I'll Take You Home"   On June 24\, 1966 Bennett & the Rebel Rousers opened up for the Beatles at the Circus Krone-Bau concert in Munich\, Germany.  In this clip the band does "C C Rider."  BTW ... The Rebel Rousers are using the drums from the Rattles\, another group playing at that show.

COL title VAL Limehouse Blues COL performer VAL Dave Brubeck Trio & Gerry Mulligan	COL video title VAL Oh Well - Oh Well COL description VAL No one knows who these guys are\, so I thought I'd post their songs. From Wikipedia\, the free encyclopedia  Oh Well were a UK dance group that started in the late 1980s. They were relatively successful during their peak in 1989\, but broke up soon after\, due to lack of chart success thereafter.  The group had two UK chart singles in 1989 and 1990: the eponymous "Oh Well" single was released in late 1989 and peaked at number 28 on the UK Singles Chart for two weeks\, starting on October 28. Their second single\, a cover of Golden Earring's "Radar Love"\, was released in early 1990 and debuted and peaked at number 63 on March 3.  The band can be referred to as a "one hit wonder"\, seeing as how they only had one single reach the Top 40. "Oh Well" was featured on Now That's What I Call Music! 16\, the sixteenth volume of the popular British hits series. COL channel name VAL 3Life3	0
COL title VAL Prairie Lullaby COL performer VAL Leon Redbone	COL video title VAL Delaney and Bonnie - "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'" (Genesis LP) COL description VAL by Delaney & Bonnie. From the "Genesis" LP  For an album that is clearly a compilation of older material meant to capitalize on the fame from Delaney & Bonnie's 1971 hits on Atco\, The "Genesis" LP is a true find! There are only three tracks from the duo\, all produced by Leon Russell; the nine other titles are Delaney Bramlett solo\, six produced by Jackie DeShannon\, three others with no producer credited. Despite the slight deception -- that this is a Delaney Bramlett album with three bonus tracks by the hit group -- the disc still works on its own. DeShannon has Delaney sounding like Gene Pitney on "Tomorrow Never Comes\," while "Heartbreak Hotel" and Ray Charles' "I Got a Woman" have him emulating Elvis. On the uncredited production of "Lonely Me\," Mr. Bramlett goes for an early John Lennon vocal style\, then veers off to Gerry and the Pacemakers territory on his originals\, "Without Your Love" and "Better Man Than Me\," quite revealing in that they are so different from the music Jimmy Miller produced for the group when Delaney & Bonnie on Tour With Eric Clapton emerged. Jackie DeShannon's pop production kicks in again with "Liverpool Lou\," and it is back to that Gene Pitney sound. COL channel name VAL BobSeger1981	0

A founding member of the group was Dionne Warwick\, who was later replaced by her aunt\, Cissy Houston. The Sweet Inspirations was founded by former members of The Drinkard Singers\, a long-running Gospel singing group whose membership included Cissy Houston (née Drinkard\, and mother of Whitney Houston\, 1963) and Lee Warwick\, who was Cissy's sister and the mother of Sweet Inspirations members Dee Dee and Dionne Warwick). As a backup group\, the Sweet Inspirations were in high demand among producers\, publishers\, artists\, and songwriters in the early 1960s. The original lineup included Doris Troy and the two Warwick sisters Dionne & Dee Dee. Sylvia Shemwell (sister of Judy Clay) replaced Troy\, while Cissy Houston took over from Dionne\, with Dee Dee Warwick as the group's official leader. The group sang backup for many stars\, including Solomon Burke\, Aretha Franklin\, Wilson Pickett\, and Esther Phillips. Dee Dee left in 1965\, when her solo career began to take off. She was replaced by Myrna Smith. Estelle Brown joined the team soon after\, and the line-up that was to become an Atlantic recording group was set. The Sweet Inspirations recorded by themselves for the first time in April 1967 for Atlantic Records. That session produced the first two singles released by Atlantic\, a version of "Why (Am I Treated So Bad)\," a song previously recorded by The Staple Singers and a soulful version of "Let It Be Me"\, a French song which had been a pop and R&B hit for Betty Everett & Jerry Butler in 1964.

Él nació en Glasgow\, Kentucky\, donde su padre era un barbero que amó la música e inspiró a Billy y le enseñó  tocar la mandolina a la edad de 3 años cuando padecía  un caso de la sarampión. Él continuó aprendiendo varios otros instrumentos.  En 1941 Vaughn se afilió a la Guardia Nacional de los Estados Unidos para lo que había sido preparado como una cesión de un año\, pero cuando la Segunda Guerra Mundial estalló\, le enviaron al extranjero hasta el final la guerra  en 1945.  Él decidió hacer de la música su carrera cuando él fue licenciado del ejército al final de guerra\, y asistió al Colegio de Estado de Kentucky Occidental\, ahora conocido como la Universidad de Kentucky Occidental.  Mientras él estaba un estudiante allí\, otros tres compañeros\, Jimmy Sacca\, Donald McGuire\, y Seymour Spiegelman\, que habían formado un trío vocal\, el Hilltoppers\, reclutaron a Vaughn para tocar el piano con ellos. Él pronto añadió su voz \, convirtiendo el trío en un cuarteto. Como  miembro del grupo\, él también escribió su primera canción \, Tentativa\, que charted en 1952.  En 1954 dejó el grupo para afiliarse a Archivos de Punto en Gallatin\, Tennessee como el director de música. Posteriormente formó su propia orquesta\, y tuvo un gran éxito en aquel mismo año "con la Melodía del Amor." Continuó cosechando éxitos  durante la próxima década y media. Vaughn murió del cáncer en Palomar\, California el 26 de septiembre\, { El 26 de septiembre} 1991.

COL title VAL Got You on My Mind COL performer VAL Orion	COL video title VAL Beverly Kenney - That's All (Previously Unreleased Demo Session before Decca Records 1954) COL description VAL "That's All" is a 1952 song written by Alan Brandt and Bob Haymes. It has been covered by many jazz and blues artists. The song is part of the Great American Songbook. Nat King Cole first sang the song in 1953.   Beverly Kenney (January 29\, 1932\, Harrison\, New Jersey -- April 13\, 1960\, New York City) was an American jazz singer.  Kenney worked early in life for Western Union as a telephone birthday singer. After moving to New York City\, she recorded a demo in 1954 with Tony Tamburello; the demo was released in its entirety in 2006 by SSJ Records in 2006 under the title Snuggled on Your Shoulder and included the song "That's All". By the end of the year she had moved to Miami\, where she landed a recurring engagement at the Black Magic Room. Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey heard her and took her on tour in the orchestra they co-led; she worked with them for several months before breaking off to move back to New York. Upon her return\, she worked in clubs with George Shearing\, Don Elliott\, and Kai Winding; After a short tour of the Midwest with Larry Sonn\, she signed to Roost Records and released her first album in 1956. Her second release was Come Swing with Me\, and Jimmy Jones led an ensemble behind her for her third and final release for Roost in 1957.  Beverly moved to Decca Records\, and released three further LPs with them\, including Beverly Kenney Sings For Playboys (1958)\, Born to Be Blue (1959)\, and Like Yesterday (1959). Beverly Kenney Sings For Playboys featured liner notes by Steve Allen\, which praised Kenney's vocal style and stated\, "A word to Playboys: I would not recommend this album as Music to Make the Romantic Approach By. You're apt to get more interested in Beverly than the girl you're trying to impress."  Beverly was a critically acclaimed musician\, but she saw little widespread acceptance\, due at least in part to the burgeoning rock & roll movement. She had an intense personal dislike for this music\, even going so far as to compose a song called "I Hate Rock and Roll"\, which she performed on the Steve Allen Show on May 18\, 1958.  On April 13\, 1960\, Kenney committed suicide by an overdose of alcohol and Seconal. She was 28 years old. She remains a cult figure in Japan\, where all of her albums have been reissued to CD and have remained in print on a relatively steady basis. Japan's SSJ Records have released three collections of unreleased Beverly Kenney material: Snuggled on Your Shoulder (2006)\, Lonely and Blue (2007)\, and What Is There To Say? (2009). This first in the series\, Snuggled on Your Shoulder\, was reissued by Cellar Door Records in 2010; it features the SSJ Records release in its entirety plus bonus tracks from a recently discovered radio show. One track from Snuggled On Your Shoulder\, "Tea For Two"\, was released on the Vintage music compilation\, This is Vintage Now (2011).  Beverly's accompanied by Tony Tamburello on piano.  Again\, this is from her actual recording demo from 1954.  There are those\, I am sure\, who have told you They would give you the world for a toy All I have are these arms to enfold you And a love time can never destroy  I can only give you love that lasts forever And a promise to be near each time you call And a love who's burning light will warm the winter night  And That's all That's all  I can only give you country walks in springtime And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall And heart I call my own is yours and yours alone  And That's all That's all  There are those\, I am sure\, who have told you They would give you the world just for a toy All I have are these arms to enfold you With a love time can never destroy  If you're wondering what I'm asking in return\, dear You'll be so glad to know that my demands are small Say it's me that you'll adore for now and ever more  And That's all...

Forget what we're told Before we get too old Show me a garden That's bursting into life  Let's waste time Chasing cars Around our heads I need your grace To remind me To find my own  If I lay here If I just lay here Would you lie with me And just forget the world? Forget what we're told Before we get too old Show me a garden That's bursting into life  All that I am All that I ever was Is here in your perfect eyes They're all I can see I don't know where Confused about how as well Just know that these things Will never change for us at all  If I lay here If I just lay here Would you lie with me And just forget the world?  #SnowPatrol  Music video by Snow Patrol performing Chasing Cars.

Noone's playing is lyrical and sophisticated\, and certainly makes more use of "sweet" flavoring. Noone was an important influence on later clarinetists such as Artie Shaw and Benny Goodman. He started playing guitar in his home town and at the age of 15\, he switched to the clarinet and moved to New Orleans. He studied with Lorenzo Tio and with the young Sidney Bechet\, who was only 13 at the time. By 1912\, he was playing professionally with Kid Ory\, Papa Celestin\, the Eagle Band before joining the Original Creole Orchestra in Chicago in 1917. The following year\, he joined King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band\, then in 1926\, he started leading the band at Chicago's Apex Club\, the Jimmie Noone's Apex Club Orchestra\, in which the influential pianist Earl Hines was playing for a time. In  1943 he moved to Los Angeles\, where he died suddenly of a heart attack. The Kid Ory's band played for him the blues titled "Blues for Jimmie" on the radio\, and the number eventually became a regular feature for the Ory band. COL channel name VAL 240252	0

COL title VAL I Want to Break Free COL performer VAL Paul Dempsey	COL video title VAL Shirley Bassey - Blues In The Night (1957 Recording) COL description VAL 1957 (A young Shirley Bassey recorded this Johnny Mercer / Harold Arlen American Songbook Standard back in 1956 and it was released as a track on her first LP in 1957.  One of the songs from this LP\, 'Born To Sing The Blues' was released as a single in 1956.  Shirley has recorded & performed many genre's of music over her past 60+ years in show business due to her powerful voice & musical instincts\, but jazz & the blues were among the first that she mastered.  ABOUT this song: "Blues in the Night" is a popular song which has become a pop standard and is generally considered to be part of the Great American Songbook. The music was written by Harold Arlen\, the lyrics by Johnny Mercer\, for a 1941 film begun with the working title Hot Nocturne\, but finally released as Blues in the Night. The song is sung in the film by William Gillespie.  Arlen and Mercer wrote the entire score for the 1941 film Blues in the Night. One requirement was for a blues song to be sung in a jail cell. As usual with Mercer\, the composer wrote the music first\, then Mercer wrote the words. Arlen said\,   The whole thing just poured out. And I knew in my guts\, without even thinking what Johnny would write for a lyric\, that this was strong\, strong\, strong! When Mercer wrote "Blues in the Night"\, I went over his lyric and I started to hum it over his desk. It sounded marvelous once I got to the second stanza but that first twelve was weak tea. On the third or fourth page of his work sheets I saw some lines—one of them was "My momma done tol' me\, when I was in knee pants." I said\, "Why don't you try that?" It was one of the very few times I've ever suggested anything like that to John.  When they finished writing the song\, Mercer called a friend\, singer Margaret Whiting\, and asked if they could come over and play it for her. She suggested they come later because she had dinner guests—Mickey Rooney\, Judy Garland\, Mel Tormé\, and Martha Raye. Instead\, Arlen and Mercer went right over. Margaret Whiting remembered what happened then:   They came in the back door\, sat down at the piano and played the score of "Blues in the Night". I remember forever the reaction. Mel got up and said\, "I can't believe it." Martha couldn't say a word. Mickey Rooney said\, "That's the greatest thing I've ever heard." Judy Garland said\, "Play it again." We had them play it seven times. Judy and I ran to the piano to see who was going to learn it first. It was a lovely night.  A few of the great singers/musicians from the past who recorded this song were Ella Fitzgerald\, Frank Sinatra\, Rosemary Clooney\, Dinah Shore\, Judy Garland\, Bing Crosby\, Woody Herman\, Louis Armstrong\, Jo Stafford\, Doris Day\, Billy Eckstine\, Julie London\, Cab Calloway\, Kate Smith\, Van Morrison\, The Group Chicago\, and of course\, Shirley who was a teenager when she recorded it.   A few of the younger generation artists who have recorded this song include Amy Winehouse\, Eva Cassidy\, and Katie Melua.  ALL versions are Great\, because the song itself is a Classic for ALL generations!  LYRICS: My mama done tol' me\, when I was in pig tails My mama done tol' me\, " Child a man'll sweet talk" And give ya the big eye\, but when the sweet talkin's done A man is a two-face\, A worrisome thing who'll leave ya to sing the blues in the night  Now the rain's a-fallin'\, hear the train's a-callin\, "Whooee!" (My mama done tol' me) Hear dat lonesome whistle blowin' 'cross the trestle\, "Whooee!" (My mama done tol' me) A-whooee-ah-whooee ol' clickety-clack's a-echoin' back th' blues in the night  The evenin' breeze'll start the trees to cryin' and the moon'll hide its light when you get the blues in the night Take my word\, the mockingbird'll sing the saddest kind o' song\, he knows things are wrong\, and he's right  From Natchez to Mobile\, from Memphis to St. Joe\, wherever the four winds blow I been in some big towns an' heard me some big talk\, but there is one thing I know A man is a two-face\, a worrisome thing who'll leave ya to sing the blues in the night  Special Thanks to Pieter and Astrid from the Shirley Bassey blog and all those who have provided wonderful pictures of Shirley!

After three attempts with moderate chart ratings\, "I Walk the Line" became the first number one Billboard hit for Cash. The single remained on the record charts for over 43 weeks\, and sold over 2 million copies. The song has been used on many Sun Records LP's such as With His Hot and Blue Guitar\, Sings the Songs That Made Him Famous & Sings Hank Williams.  Background of the song  The unique chord progression for the song was inspired by backwards playback of guitar runs on Cash's tape recorder while he was in the Air Force stationed in Germany. Later in a telephone interview\, Cash stated\, “I wrote the song backstage one night in 1956 in Gladewater\, Texas. I was newly married at the time\, and I suppose I was laying out my pledge of devotion." After the writing of the song Cash had a discussion with fellow performer Carl Perkins who encouraged him to adopt "I Walk the Line" as the song title. Cash originally intended the song as a slow ballad\, but producer Sam Phillips preferred a faster arrangement\, which Cash grew to like as the uptempo recording met with success.  Once while performing the song on his TV show\, Cash told the audience\, with a smile\, "People ask me why I always hum whenever I sing this song. It's to get my pitch." The humming was necessary since the song required Cash to change keys several times while singing it.  The song was originally recorded at Sun Studio on April 2\, 1956\, and was released on May 1. It spent six weeks at the top spot on the U.S. country Juke Box charts that summer\, one week on the C&W Jockey charts and number two on the C&W Best Seller charts. "I Walk the Line" crossed over and reached number 19 on the pop music charts.  It was performed with the help of Marshall Grant and Luther Perkins\, two mechanics that his brother introduced him to following his discharge from the Air Force. Cash and his wife\, Vivian\, were living in Memphis\, Tennessee\, at the time. Cash became the front man for the group and precipitated the introduction of the group to Sam Phillips of Sun Records. In 1955 they began recording under the Sun label.  The song was re-recorded four times during Cash's career. In 1964 for the I Walk the Line album\, again in 1969 for the At San Quentin album\, in 1970 for the I Walk the Line soundtrack\, and finally in 1988 for the Classic Cash: Hall of Fame Series album.  In 2004\, Rolling Stone ranked the song at #30 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.  Writing and composition  The song is very simple and like most Cash songs\, the lyrics tell more of a story than the music conveys. (You've got a way to keep me on your side/You give me cause for love that I can't hide/For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide).  It is based upon the "boom-chicka-boom" or "freight train" rhythm common in many of Cash's songs. In the original recording of the song\, there is a key change between each of the five verses\, and Cash hums the new root note before singing each verse. The final verse\, a reprise of the first\, is sung a full octave lower than the first verse. According to Cash\, he loved the sound of a snare drum\, but drums were not used in country music back then\, so he placed a piece of paper in his guitar strings and created his own unique "snare drum".  Johnny\, with the Temptations outside his door and a new wife at home\, wanted the lyrics to say\, "I’m going to be true to those who believe in me and depend on me to myself and God. Something like I’m still being true\, or I’m 'Walking The Line.' "The lyrics came as fast as I could write\," says Johnny. "In 20 minutes\, I had it finished."  Covers  In 1998\, Rodney Crowell covered the song as a duet with Cash on Crowell's album The Houston Kid. This version was titled "I Walk the Line Revisited" and peaked at number 61 on the country music charts.  Jaye P. Morgan covered the song in 1960\, the single charting at No. 66.

There have been several covers of the song (including The Birds and Saint Etienne in English) but the most known is probably the 1996 cover recording by the French artist Mylène Farmer and the French-born musician Khaled. The Farmer/Khaled cover was performed during Farmer's 1996 concert tour. After three live performances\, the song was finally released as the first single from Farmer's second live album\, Live à Bercy on 29 April 1997\, and became a top five hit in Belgium.  Background and live performances  There is a studio version of this duet\, but it was never released. This studio version was performed in lip-sync in a single television show\, Tip top\, broadcast on a French channel and host by Éric Jean-Jean\, where Farmer was invited to promote her single "Comme j'ai mal". Previously\, the show proposed to Farmer a list of singers with whom she would sing a song. She chose Khaled and decided to perform a cover of Polnareff's song\, "La Poupée qui fait non"\, and the recording lasted four hours.  Interviewed by the French magazine Instant-Mag\, Thierry Rogen\, the sound engineer who has participated in the recording\, said: "I have participated in the single "La Poupée qui fait non" with Khaled. Laurant [Boutonnat] was absent. The recording was made in the studio Merga in Suresnes in the right mood. It has been very rapid. Mylène [Farmer] and Khaled were together for four hours in total".  Farmer said she chose the song because it was the first song she learned when she was a child\, and she loved Michel Polnareff's work. Khaled also said: "This is a common idea\, we wanted to sing together. We loved both Polnareff. Personally\, I think it's the first song I learned."  The live version\, which was released in 1997\, was performed only three nights (two in Geneva and the last at Bercy) as a duet on stage during the 1996 tour. This remained the only collaboration between two artists.  The two remixes available on the CD maxi and the promotional vinyl were produced by Mylène Farmer (this is the only time she has participated in remixes of one of her singles)\, in collaboration with Thierry Rogen. However\, these remixes have not been well appreciated by the singer's fans\, because almost all the words have disappeared.  When the song was released\, Khaled declared that he found Farmer very sympathetic.[8] However\, later\, he said he had felt used by her\, since she put herself forward all the time when they performed the song and were interviewed; according to a 2009 edition of Nouvel Observateur\, Khaled qualified this collaboration as a "trap".  Critical reception  The song generally received negative reviews. According to the author Erwan Chuberre\, the duo Khaled / Farmer "which blends the sun and the darkness is on the limit of credibility". "The two worlds [of both singers] really failed to merge and this cover is soon forgotten!" Instant-Mag considered as "absurd" the fact that the studio version was never released\, and found that the song "was much harmed by the remixes that accompany it\, in which we have as the hazy impression that Mylène was amused herself (and without supervision) to press the buttons on the console of Thierry Rogen".  In France\, the single debuted at a peak of number six on 3 May 1997. However\, like Farmer's previous top ten hits\, it dropped rather quickly and fell off the top 50 after eight weeks.  Surprisingly\, the song was a big success in Belgium\, where it had a better chart trajectory in the Ultratop 40 than in France. It appeared on the chart for a total of 18 weeks from 24 May 1997\, peaked at number five on 21 June\, and managed to remain for eight weeks in the top ten. The song ranked at number 41 in the End of year chart. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

COL title VAL Ramblin' Boy COL performer VAL J.D. Crowe and The Kentucky Mountain Boys	COL video title VAL Sarah Vaughan with Clifford Brown - September Song (EmArcy Records 1954) COL description VAL "September Song" is an American pop standard composed by Kurt Weill\, with lyric by Maxwell Anderson\, introduced by Walter Huston in the 1938 Broadway musical Knickerbocker Holiday. It has since been recorded by numerous singers and instrumentalists. It was also used in the 1950 film September Affair\, and for the credits in the television series May to December (a quote from the opening line of the song).  Although the song was written as an old man's lament for the passing of his youth\, some of the most famous versions have been recorded by women artists. Thus Sarah Vaughan's version of 1955\, and Ella Fitzgerald's with pianist Paul Smith on the 1960 Verve release Ella Fitzgerald Sings Songs From Let No Man Write My Epitaph are both regarded as Jazz classics. Eartha Kitt and Weill's wife Lotte Lenya both recorded the song in 1957\, and Jo Stafford\, Patti Page as well as Anne Shelton also recorded versions during the 1950s. In 1958 Eydie Gormé included the song in her album\, Love is the season and in 1989 both Lena Horne in The Men in My Life\, and Julie Wilson in an album of Kurt Weill songs.  Personally this song reminds me of waking up in on an early Saturday morning just as the sun starts to pierce through the window shade slits and the flowers outside with morning dew start to open up. As one eye slightly opens up and then the other followed by a fisted hand arm stretch and yawn... then Sarah starts to sing this song... oh so beautifully!  Sarah's accompanied by Leader/Arranger: Ernie Wilkins\, Clifford Brown (trumpet)\, Herbie Mann (flute)\, Paul Quinichette (tenor)\, Jimmy Jones (piano)\, Joe Benjamin (bass)\, and Roy Haynes (drums). Recorded in New York\, December 18\, 1954. (EmArcy Records)  For it's a long\, long while from May to December\, But the days grow short when you reach September.  And the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame One hasn't got time for the waiting game.  And the days dwindle down to a precious few September\, November  And these few precious days I'll spend with you. These golden days I'll spend With you  And these few precious days I'll spend with you. Not January\, February\, June or July....  September COL channel name VAL RoundMidnightTV	0

COL title VAL Almost Blue COL performer VAL Diana Krall	COL video title VAL Willie Dixon - Back door man COL description VAL "Back Door Man" is a blues song written by Willie Dixon for Howlin' Wolf\, released by Chess Records as a B-side to Wolf's "Wang Dang Doodle" in 1961. The song's author Willie Dixon recorded it on his 1970 album I Am The Blues.  In southern culture\, the phrase "back-door man" refers to a man having an affair with a married woman\, using the back door as an exit before the husband comes home. The phrase "back-door man" dates from the 1920s\, but the term became a double entendre in the 1960s\, also meaning "one who practices anal intercourse."  The song became an early standard cover song of The Doors and they recorded it for their 1967 debut album.

COL title VAL Blueberry Hill COL performer VAL George Hudson and The Kings of Twist	COL video title VAL On The Sunny Side Of The Street - Coleman Hawkins (Savoy) HD COL description VAL Recorded in 1944.  Coleman Hawkins was the first great saxophonist of Jazz. As a child he was a gifted musician. In 1922\, Mamie Smith spotted him in Jesse Stone and his Blues Serenaders in Kansas City theatre and hired him away to play with her Jazz Hounds. Hawkins stayed with Smith until 1923\, and appeared on some of her records. After leaving The Jazz Hounds\, he played with Wilbur Sweatman and then made his first recordings with Fletcher Henderson. He joined Henderson's Orchestra in 1924 and stayed with him for the next ten years. In addition to his work with Henderson\, he recorded with McKinney's Cotton Pickers\, and with Red McKenzie's Mound City Blue Blowers in 1929. When he left Henderson in 1934 he moved to Europe\, and stayed there until 1939 playing first with Jack Hylton's Orchestra in England and then traveling and recording throughout the continent. In 1937 he appeared on a famous recording date with Benny Carter\, Django Reinhardt and Stéphane Grappelli. In 1939 as World War II started\, Hawkins wisely returned to America. He recorded a version of "Body and Soul" in 1940 that became his most famous record. Hawkins was one of the few Hot Jazz musicians who made the shift to Be Bop in the Forties. He hired Thelonious Monk for his quartet in 1944 and led an early bop recording session the same year which included Dizzy Gillespie. He also hired Miles Davis and Max Roach to play on his bands early in their careers. In 1946 he recorded with J.J. Johnson and Fats Navarro. By the early 1950s\, the innovations of Lester Young and Charlie Parker made Hawkins' style seem a bit old fashioned. However Hawkins was able to adapt to the changing currents in Jazz again\, when he teamed up with Roy Eldridge. Throughout the rest Fifties and Sixties he appeared on records made by Thelonious Monk\, Max Roach\, Eric Dolphy and John Coltrane. In the early 1960s Coleman Hawkins recorded with Duke Ellington\, and made a record with Sonny Rollins. COL channel name VAL althazarr's good time oldies	0

Fair use is a use permitted by copyright statute that might otherwise be infringing. Non-profit\, educational or personal use tips the balance in favour of fair use. count owen and his calypsonians - kalypso records japanese repress - mento Count Owen's middle period mento album\, "Calypsos Down Jamaica Way" was originally published in 1960 on the label "Kalypso"\, a subsidiary of "Melodisc".  Mento is a Jamaican music style that is largely unknown outside of that is the grandpappy of reggae. For a ska or reggae fan\, mento sounds familiar and exotic and sometimes unfamiliar. Mento recordings are difficult to come by\, but worth seeking out. It's music that lifts my spirits and relaxes my mind whenever I hear it.  During mento's middle period of the 1960s\, Count Owen became prolific\, as he recorded a string of five LPs that moved from mento to ska to rock steady.  "Down Jamaica Way" is the first Count Owen LP. It sticks to traditional rural mento instrumentation\, and for the most part\, repertoire.

COL title VAL Time in a Bottle COL performer VAL Jim Croce	COL video title VAL I Didn't Know What Time It Was - Cassandra Wilson COL description VAL I was searching through the YouTube archives for tunes from Cassandra Wilson's 1988 album\, "Blue Skies"\, and I was surprised to find so very few posted here. I first thought that it must be because of some contractual conflict but when I discovered that wasn't the case\, I became downright stunned. By just about anyone's account\, Ms. Wilson's Blue Skies album is considered a masterpiece. Every tune from it is well played by the musicians and what Cass does with the lyrics to songs that have been sung by virtually all of the great jazz singers is something of a revelation. She manages to make all of the tunes seem brand new and never before heard. I think one of the best examples of that is this masterful handling of Rodgers and Hart's "I Didn't Know What Time It Was". While Terri Lyne Carrington keeps a steady fire beneath her\, Cass swings the tune\, beginning and ending some sung phrases with delightful little scats. She then breaks into a fully improvised scat right before Mulgrew Miller scorches us with his highly inventive solo. Special mention should also be made of rock-steady Lonnie Plaxico's bass work throughout\, always vibrant and swinging. I could have chosen any tune from the album to provide as an example of the album's fineness so don't settle on hearing just this tune. If you love jazz\, you've got to cop Cassandra Wilson's "Blue Skies".

COL title VAL Besame Mucho COL performer VAL Dianne Reeves	COL video title VAL BESAME MUCHO - THE HI-LO'S COL description VAL BESAME MUCHO (Consuelo Velazquez) Vai dizer que nunca ouviu? Este famosíssimo bolero foi escrito em 1940 pela compositora Consolo Velázquez com 24 anos e como ela mesma confessou\, quando ainda não tinha sido beijada. É uma das canções mais populares do século XX e em 1999 foi reconhecida como a mais cantada\, reproduzida e gravada em espanhol. Também é considerada a mais traduzida\, com versões em mais de 20 idiomas THE HI-LO'S The Hi-Lo's were an a cappella quartet formed in 1953. The group's name is reportedly a reference to their extreme vocal and physical ranges (Bob Strasen and Bob Morse were tall\, Gene Puerling and Clark Burroughs were short). Besame Mucho Sunny Skylar - Consuelo Velazquez - Recorded August 7\, 1961 - Arranged by Gene Puerling Consuelo Velásquez Torres (Ciudad Guzmán/Zapotlán el Grande\, Jalisco\, 21 de agosto de 1924 -- Cidade do México\, 22 de janeirode 2005) foi uma pianista e compositora mexicana. Bésame mucho (em português Beija-me muito) é o título de uma canção escrita em 1940 pela mexicana Consuelo Velásquez antes de completar seu 16° aniversário. Segundo Consuelo Velázquez\, ela inspirou-se em uma ária de uma ópera de Enrique Granados. Rapidamente a canção se converteu em uma das mais populares do século XX. Emilio Tuero foi o primeiro a gravar-la. Em 1999\, a canção foi reconhecida com a mais cantada e gravada do idioma espanhol\, e talvez seja a mais traduzida entre as compostas nesta língua. (Wikipedia) Há mais de 2000 gravações diferentes. Cantores brasileiros que gravaram: Francisco Alves\, Clara Nunes\, Leila Pinheiro\, Rosa Passos\, Maysa Matarazzo\, Alda Rezende\, Cauby Peixoto\, Ney Matogrosso.. A gravação mais recente é do conjunto MPB 4\, Muitos cantores de jazz já gravaram como Diana Krall. Temos ainda gravações de The Beatles\, Elvis Presley\, Frank Sinatra\, entre centenas de intérpretes de jazz\, cantores ou instrumentistas de renome.  Besame Mucho Maysa Bésame\, bésame mucho Como si fuera esta la noche La última vez  Bésame\, bésame mucho Que tengo miedo a perderte Perderte después  Quiero tenerte muy cerca Mirarme en tus ojos Verte junto a mí Piensa que tal vez mañana Yo ya estaré lejos Muy lejos de aquí  Bésame\, bésame mucho Como si fuera esta la noche La última vez  Bésame\, bésame mucho Que tengo miedo a perderte Perderte después  Bésame\, bésame mucho Besame\, besame mucho\,  Each time I cling to your kiss\, I hear music divine\,  Besame mucho\,  Hold me my darling and say that you'll always be mine.  This joy is something new\, my arms enfolding you\,  Never knew this thrill before.  Whoever thought I'll be holding you close to me\,  Whispering it's you I adore.  Dearest one\, if you should leave me\,  Each little dream would take wing and my life would be through\,  Besame mucho\, love me forever and make all my dreams come true.. Besame\, besame mucho\,  Como si fuera esta noche la ultima vez.  Besame\, besame mucho\,  Que tengo miedo tenerte y perderte depues.  Quiero tenerte muy cerca mirarme en tus ojos estar junto de ti.  Pienso que tal vez maana estarte muy lejos muy lejos de ti.  Besame\, besame mucho\,  Como si fuera esta noche la ultima vez.  Besame\, besame mucho\,  Que tengo miedo tenerte y perderte despues.

It was a disaster But before Christmas day was up\, guess who was making potholders? Everybody in the whole family And you can't even wrap this under the tree but\, here comes Christmas for me Just getting to hear my girls sing  Christmas\, Christmas time is near Time for toys and time for cheer We've been good\, but we can't last Hurry Christmas\, hurry fast Want a plane that loops the loop Me\, I want a hula hoop We can hardly stand the wait Please Christmas\, don't be late We can hardly stand the wait Please Christmas\, don't be late   Amy Grant has built a long\, successful career on music that matters. Ever since she burst on the scene as a fresh-faced teenager bringing contemporary Christian music to the forefront of American culture\, the Nashville native gained a reputation for creating potent songs that examined life’s complexities with an open heart and keen eye. She became the first artist in Christian music to have a platinum record and went on to become a crossover sensation\, her musical gifts transcending genre boundaries to make her a household name.

COL title VAL I'm Walkin' COL performer VAL Fats Domino	COL video title VAL Delaney and Bonnie - "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'" (Genesis LP) COL description VAL by Delaney & Bonnie. From the "Genesis" LP  For an album that is clearly a compilation of older material meant to capitalize on the fame from Delaney & Bonnie's 1971 hits on Atco\, The "Genesis" LP is a true find! There are only three tracks from the duo\, all produced by Leon Russell; the nine other titles are Delaney Bramlett solo\, six produced by Jackie DeShannon\, three others with no producer credited. Despite the slight deception -- that this is a Delaney Bramlett album with three bonus tracks by the hit group -- the disc still works on its own. DeShannon has Delaney sounding like Gene Pitney on "Tomorrow Never Comes\," while "Heartbreak Hotel" and Ray Charles' "I Got a Woman" have him emulating Elvis. On the uncredited production of "Lonely Me\," Mr. Bramlett goes for an early John Lennon vocal style\, then veers off to Gerry and the Pacemakers territory on his originals\, "Without Your Love" and "Better Man Than Me\," quite revealing in that they are so different from the music Jimmy Miller produced for the group when Delaney & Bonnie on Tour With Eric Clapton emerged. Jackie DeShannon's pop production kicks in again with "Liverpool Lou\," and it is back to that Gene Pitney sound. COL channel name VAL BobSeger1981	0

The singer has such exquisite sensibilities and respectfully memorialises standards such as this one\, as well as her original compositions and collaborations. The mark of a great singer is the ability to cover a song like 'Moon River'\, one of the most recorded tunes in history\, and still make it her own. Now more than half a century old\, the Henry Mancini classic penned for the Audrey Hepburn movie 'Breakfast at Tiffanys'\, is in truly safe hands with Ms Reader. It is delivered with such intimacy but at the same time\, potency and soul. COL channel name VAL daveinprogress3	0

He leads and she follows as light as the wind. But why are you blushing\, Cecilia Lind?  Could it be something Fred Singer has said? "Your grace and your perfume go straight to my head. Your figure is lovely 'et tres feminine'! My God\, you're so pretty\, Cecilia Lind."  But the band finished playing\, where could they go now? The street where she lived was near his anyhow. They arrived at her gate and before going in\, "I want you to kiss me\," said Cecilia Lind."  Shame on you\, Freddy\, your old heart's gone wild! Cecilia Lind is still only a child as pure as a flower\, unblemished by sin. "I'm soon seventeen\," said Cecilia Lind."  The hours drift away in the stars' magic light. Though Freddy is old\, there's a new moon tonight. They say love is blind\, you may lose -- you may win. "Oh\, kiss me again\," said Cecilia Lind." COL channel name VAL Lena Lindell	0

They both possessed immediately identifiable sounds\, were veterans of Count Basie's Orchestra and never had any difficulty swinging. The repertoire of this Edison album is not too creative with five blues among its eight songs and one of the others\, "Feelings\," being quite forgettable. However\, the playing of the principals (along with pianist Dolo Coker who also makes a couple of surprising appearances on electric keyboard) holds one's interest throughout.

COL title VAL Everytime We Say Goodbye COL performer VAL Karrin Allyson	COL video title VAL Leslie West - Tequila.wmv COL description VAL Leslie West - As Phat As It Gets (1999) He's half the man he used to be in terms of mass\, but when it comes to rock & roll\, just stand back and listen as the master holds court. The man who once recorded an album called The Great Fatsby is back\, slimmed down and kicking as hard as ever on tracks like "Palace of the King" and "Allergic." West comes out jamming\, backed by some pretty familiar names from the lexicon of classic rock\, including Joe Lynn Turner\, Kim Simmonds of Savoy Brown\, Popa Chubby\, and a little band called the Destroyers\, who take time away from their day job playing with a fella named George Thorogood. When West rips into the old blues standard "Stormy Monday\," it's take-no-prisoners electric blues\, and his covers of "Tequila" and Otis Redding's "Respect" are Mountain-ized. (Speaking of "Respect\," it's a little-known fact that West's first group\, the Vagrants\, had a version of that very same song out on a single in 1969 that was meant to be their key to the big time\, but when Atco issued Aretha Franklin's now-legendary version\, the Vagrants' record was blasted into obscurity.) "Raw Nerve" rocks with a real Billy Gibbons influence\, and "The Cell" is an infectious life-in-prison tune that's meant to be played loud. Actually\, the whole album sounds best with the volume knob set at 11. Oh\, and if you're looking for blues\, there's a ripsnorter penned by Leon Russell called "Me and My Guitar." "As Phat as It Gets" mixes the best elements of Frank Zappa\, Black Sabbath\, and Mountain into one smoldering tune about weight loss.  Tracklist  1. Saturation (I'm In Love With You)   (03:23) 2.

Now more than half a century old\, the Henry Mancini classic penned for the Audrey Hepburn movie 'Breakfast at Tiffanys'\, is in truly safe hands with Ms Reader.

Gates Of Steel - Supernova 12. Freedom Of Choice - Lagwagon 13. Beautiful World - One Hit Wonder  ------------------------  "Whip It" is the title of a 1980 single by the American New Wave band Devo. It appears on the album Freedom of Choice. There were two 7" single releases of "Whip It"\, one backed with a remix of the track "Snowball" (which appears on Freedom of Choice) and one backed with "Turn Around" (a song later covered by Nirvana).  "Whip It" was Devo's biggest hit\, and peaked at number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart\, number three on the Canadian Singles Chart and number 77 on the Australian Singles Chart (Kent Music Report).  It is ranked #62 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of the '80s as well as #15 on the same channel's 100 Greatest One Hit Wonders of the '80s  Song information  "Whip It" is built on a motorik beat\, similar to tracks by Neu!. The lead instrument is a Minimoog synthesizer. The bass is performed with a custom six oscillator synthesizer\, custom made by Moog Music for Devo. The whip sound was made with an EML ElectroComp 500 synthesizer.  On an episode of the VH1 show TrueSpin\, Gerald V. Casale revealed that the lead guitar riff from "Whip It" is based on the riff from "Oh\, Pretty Woman" by Roy Orbison with the beat moved to the back.  Gerald Casale told Songfacts that the lyrics were written by him "as an imitation of Thomas Pynchon's parodies in his book Gravity's Rainbow." The lyrics evoke a working class desire to pull oneself up and to overcome adversity. The song has violent undertones\, and Devo has often described it as about Jimmy Carter\, as Mothersbaugh describes in an interview on To The Best of our Knowledge. However\, many people took the lyrics at face value\, interpreting the song as a paean to masturbation and sadomasochism\, or a reference to inhaling nitrous oxide from whipped cream cans (taken from the name "whip-it"\, used to describe the nitrous chargers for whipped cream dispensers).  "Whip It" debuted at a live concert on December 29th\, 1979 in Santa Cruz\, California. The first performance included a synthesizer solo taken from the early Devo song "Chango." This performance was recorded and is available as a bootleg. A demo version was recorded in 1980 and later released in 2000 on the compilation Recombo DNA released by Rhino Handmade.  Music video  Devo funded the music video for "Whip It" with $15\,000 USD of their own money. The main visual of the video\, Mark Mothersbaugh whipping the clothes off a woman\, was inspired by an article in a 1962 issue of "Dude" magazine. In an interview for Songfacts\, Casale explains "There was a feature article on a guy who had been an actor and fell on hard times\, he wasn't getting parts anymore. He moved with his wife to Arizona\, opened a dude ranch and charged people money to come hang out at the ranch. Every day at noon in the corral\, for entertainment\, he'd whip his wife's clothes off with a 12-foot bullwhip. She sewed the costumes and put them together with Velcro. The story was in the magazine about how good he was and how he never hurt her. We had such a big laugh about it\, we said\, 'OK\, that's the basis for the video. We'll have these cowboys drinking beer and cheering Mark on as he's in the barnyard whipping this pioneer woman's clothes off while the band plays in the corral.'"  In the video\, Devo wears black\, sleeveless turtlenecks\, and their famous Energy Dome headgear. When the video begins\, all the members\, except for Mark Mothersbaugh\, wear the turtlenecks pulled over their faces. During the performance\, each member lowers the turtleneck. Robert Mothersbaugh ("Bob 1") plays a Moog Liberation keytar\, Robert Casale ("Bob 2") plays a red Rheem Kee Bass\, and Alan Myers plays a set of Synare electronic drum pads.  Not surprisingly\, the S&M overtones of the video caused controversy. Devo was forced to abandon a television appearance after the host deemed the video offensive to women. Despite this\, "Whip It" received heavy rotation on MTV after its introduction in 1981. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

COL title VAL 'Round Midnight COL performer VAL Bettye LaVette	COL video title VAL Chaka  Khans "Round Midnight!!!!!!!!!!!! COL description VAL ClassiKhan From Wikipedia\, the free encyclopedia ClassiKhan  Studio album by Chaka Khan Released October 5\, 2004 Genre Vocal\, Jazz Label Sanctuary Records (U.K.) Earthsong / AgU Music Group (U.S.) JVC Victor (Japan) Producer Ira Schickman Eve Nelson Chaka Khan Professional reviews Allmusic  [1] Chaka Khan chronology Dance Classics of Chaka Khan (1999) ClassiKhan (2004) The Platinum Collection (2006) ClassiKhan is the twelfth studio album by American R&B/funk singer Chaka Khan\, featuring the London Symphony Orchestra\, Produced and arranged by Eve Nelson and released in 2004 on the at the time still independent label Sanctuary Records in the U.K.\, on Earthsong/AgU Music Group in the U.S. and in 2005 also in Japan on JVC Victor. As Allmusic point out in their review\, with Khan's well-known affinity and acclaim for interpreting jazz standards in mind\, which through most of her career on the Warner Bros. label had been relegated to the backburner\, an album with the title ClassiKhan could at first glance very easily be mistaken for being a belated sequel to 1982's Echoes of an Era. While the album indeed does focus on jazz and swing standards like "Stormy Weather"\, "Hazel's Hips"\, "Round Midnight" and "Teach Me Tonight" it also features an eclectic selection of classics from other genres\, like pop culture favourites such as Broadway show tune "Hey Big Spender" from the musical Sweet Charity\, Peggy Lee's "Is That All There Is?" penned by Leiber & Stoller and even a 60's country and western classic in the form of Patsy Cline's "Crazy"\, written by Willie Nelson. ClassiKhan also features the themes of classic film favourites from Khan's youth\, "To Sir With Love" and the James Bond themes "Goldfinger" and "Diamonds Are Forever". The collection concludes with one new composition\, the ballad "I Believe"\, co-written by Khan and the album's producer Ira Shickman. The title ClassiKhan is naturally also a reference to Khan's accompaniment on the set. On the Echoes of an Era album it was a five-piece all-star jazz ensemble\, on ClassiKhan it is The New York All Star Musicians - but with the addition of the full London Symphony Orchestra\, conducted and arranged by Eve Nelson and with orchestrations by producer Ira Schickman and Gary Anderson. The album was mainly recorded at London's legendary Abbey Road Studios and it features guest appearances by among others pianist Joe Sample and percussionist Sheila E.\, best known for her work with Prince. ClassiKhan was both a critical and commercial success\, even reaching #42 on Billboard's R&B albums chart. COL channel name VAL ChakaFanTV	1

COL title VAL Sweet Leilani COL performer VAL Leo Addeo and His Orchestra	COL video title VAL Ferrante & Teicher - Scarborough Fair (4/12) COL description VAL Ferrante & Teicher were a duo of American piano players\, known for their light arrangements of familiar classical pieces\, movie soundtracks\, and show tunes.  Scarborough Fair Trad. arr. Ferrante & Teicher  United Artists 6725  Arthur Ferrante (September 7\, 1921\, New York City -- September 19\, 2009)\, and Louis Teicher (August 24\, 1924\, Wilkes-Barre\, Pennsylvania -- August 3\, 2008) met while studying at the Juilliard School of Music in New York. Musical prodigies\, they began performing as a piano duo while still in school. After graduating\, they both joined the Juilliard faculty.  Steven Tyler of Aerosmith relates the story that in the 1950's the two students practiced in the home of his grandmother Constance Neidhart Tallarico.  In 1947\, they launched a full-time concert career\, at first playing nightclubs\, then quickly moving up to playing classical music with orchestral backing. Between 1950 and 1980\, they were a major American easy listening act\, and scored four big U.S. hits: "Theme From The Apartment" (Pop #10)\, "Theme From Exodus" (Pop #2)\, "Tonight" (Pop #8)\, and "Midnight Cowboy" (Pop #10). They performed and recorded regularly with pops orchestras popular standards by George Gershwin\, Jerome Kern\, Cole Porter\, Richard Rodgers and others. In 1973\, they did the Hollywood Radio Theater theme for the Rod Serling radio drama series\, The Zero Hour.  The duo also experimented with prepared pianos\, adding paper\, sticks\, rubber\, wood blocks\, metal bars\, chains\, glass\, mallets\, and other found objects to piano string beds. In this way they were able to produce a variety of bizarre sounds that sometimes resembled percussion instruments\, and at other times resulted in special effects that sounded as if they were electronically synthesized.  Both men were initiated as honorary members of Tau Kappa Epsilon at Central State University (now University of Central Oklahoma) while on tour.  Ferrante and Teicher ceased performing in 1989 and retired to Longboat Key and Siesta Key\, respectively\, both close to each other on the west coast of Florida. They continued to play together occasionally at a local piano store.  CDs of their music\, some of it not previously released\, have continued to appear.  Louis Teicher died in 2008\, three weeks before his 84th birthday. Arthur Ferrante died on September 19\, 2009 at 88 (he had once said he wanted to live one year for each piano key). Arthur is survived by his wife\, Jena; his daughter\, Brenda Eberhardt; and two granddaughters. COL channel name VAL MultiUriahheep	0

COL title VAL Streets of Laredo COL performer VAL Tex Ritter	COL video title VAL Marc Cohn sings The Letter from his new album Listening Booth\, 1970 COL description VAL Listening Booth:1970 represents a continuation of a creative resurgence for Cohn\, ultimately brought on by one of the strangest and scariest events of his life. In 2005\, while driving back to his hotel with his band and tour manager after a show in Denver\, Cohn was shot in the head by a would - be carjacker. Although the bullet had to be removed from his left temple\, it miraculously missed penetrating his skull by a centimeter\, causing no physical damage and allowing him to be released from the hospital the next day. After working through a bout with post-traumatic stress syndrome\, Cohn has been busier than ever. Ending a nearly ten-year absence from the studio\, he released one of his most critically acclaimed records\, Join The Parade\, in 2007 and followed it with well over 150 shows across the country. "I had always had my priorities straight when it came to my family. For me\, it never felt right bringing children into the world and then spending all your time in a studio or a tour bus. But that night in Denver somehow brought me a new appreciation for my work and my audience."    Now\, Listening Booth:1970 ultimately brings Cohn back to where he began-- writing songs like 'Walking In Memphis' which spoke so eloquently about the transformative\, healing power of music. Like that hit single\, Listening Booth: 1970 is really the soundtrack to his life. As Cohn reflects\, "It seemed like such a natural progression for me to do a record like this because\, if you've been following my records from my first single\, I have been paying tribute to musicians through my writing all along\, from Al Green to Elvis to Levon Helm to Charlie Christian\, It's really been a touchstone for me. Now I'm just repaying a debt of gratitude to the artists who've changed my life and taught me how to do what I do." COL channel name VAL TheGigante	0

COL title VAL Paperback Writer COL performer VAL Eric Johnson	COL video title VAL ♥ "The Way of Love" - by Kathy Kirby COL description VAL UPDATE: May 20\, 2011 -- It's in the news that this lovely artist joined her Creator today.  Peace be unto her..... - Originally uploaded in my previous channel (65Reasons) on June 16\, 2008. It is being re-uploaded with some updates... - "The Way of Love" Composer: Jacques Dieval English Lyrics: Al Stillman   The lyricist for the French version "J'ai le mal de toi" is Michel Rivegauche.  The song was originally written in French under the name 'J'ai le mal de toi' and recorded by Lili Castel for the song competition "Musik Ohne Grenzen" on the Belgian radio (BRT).   The French lyrics were written by Michel Rivgauche.   In 1965\, it was released as a single by Kathy Kirby in English. Curiously\, while this single failed to chart in her native United Kingdom\, where Kirby placed several singles on the charts in the mid-60's\, it became her only song to place on Billboard Hot 100. The song's lyrics were penned from a male point of view. Kirby's rendition does not change the perspective\, creating a story in which the subject to whom she sings has left her for a male.  "The Way of Love" was later recorded by Cher. Her version hit number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 in February 1972.   - Enjoy! - COL channel name VAL 65Seasons	0

Gates Of Steel - Supernova 12. Freedom Of Choice - Lagwagon 13. Beautiful World - One Hit Wonder  ------------------------  "Whip It" is the title of a 1980 single by the American New Wave band Devo. It appears on the album Freedom of Choice. There were two 7" single releases of "Whip It"\, one backed with a remix of the track "Snowball" (which appears on Freedom of Choice) and one backed with "Turn Around" (a song later covered by Nirvana).  "Whip It" was Devo's biggest hit\, and peaked at number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart\, number three on the Canadian Singles Chart and number 77 on the Australian Singles Chart (Kent Music Report).  It is ranked #62 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of the '80s as well as #15 on the same channel's 100 Greatest One Hit Wonders of the '80s  Song information  "Whip It" is built on a motorik beat\, similar to tracks by Neu!. The lead instrument is a Minimoog synthesizer. The bass is performed with a custom six oscillator synthesizer\, custom made by Moog Music for Devo. The whip sound was made with an EML ElectroComp 500 synthesizer.  On an episode of the VH1 show TrueSpin\, Gerald V. Casale revealed that the lead guitar riff from "Whip It" is based on the riff from "Oh\, Pretty Woman" by Roy Orbison with the beat moved to the back.  Gerald Casale told Songfacts that the lyrics were written by him "as an imitation of Thomas Pynchon's parodies in his book Gravity's Rainbow." The lyrics evoke a working class desire to pull oneself up and to overcome adversity. The song has violent undertones\, and Devo has often described it as about Jimmy Carter\, as Mothersbaugh describes in an interview on To The Best of our Knowledge. However\, many people took the lyrics at face value\, interpreting the song as a paean to masturbation and sadomasochism\, or a reference to inhaling nitrous oxide from whipped cream cans (taken from the name "whip-it"\, used to describe the nitrous chargers for whipped cream dispensers).  "Whip It" debuted at a live concert on December 29th\, 1979 in Santa Cruz\, California. The first performance included a synthesizer solo taken from the early Devo song "Chango." This performance was recorded and is available as a bootleg. A demo version was recorded in 1980 and later released in 2000 on the compilation Recombo DNA released by Rhino Handmade.  Music video  Devo funded the music video for "Whip It" with $15\,000 USD of their own money. The main visual of the video\, Mark Mothersbaugh whipping the clothes off a woman\, was inspired by an article in a 1962 issue of "Dude" magazine. In an interview for Songfacts\, Casale explains "There was a feature article on a guy who had been an actor and fell on hard times\, he wasn't getting parts anymore. He moved with his wife to Arizona\, opened a dude ranch and charged people money to come hang out at the ranch. Every day at noon in the corral\, for entertainment\, he'd whip his wife's clothes off with a 12-foot bullwhip. She sewed the costumes and put them together with Velcro. The story was in the magazine about how good he was and how he never hurt her. We had such a big laugh about it\, we said\, 'OK\, that's the basis for the video. We'll have these cowboys drinking beer and cheering Mark on as he's in the barnyard whipping this pioneer woman's clothes off while the band plays in the corral.'"  In the video\, Devo wears black\, sleeveless turtlenecks\, and their famous Energy Dome headgear. When the video begins\, all the members\, except for Mark Mothersbaugh\, wear the turtlenecks pulled over their faces. During the performance\, each member lowers the turtleneck. Robert Mothersbaugh ("Bob 1") plays a Moog Liberation keytar\, Robert Casale ("Bob 2") plays a red Rheem Kee Bass\, and Alan Myers plays a set of Synare electronic drum pads.  Not surprisingly\, the S&M overtones of the video caused controversy. Devo was forced to abandon a television appearance after the host deemed the video offensive to women. Despite this\, "Whip It" received heavy rotation on MTV after its introduction in 1981. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

COL title VAL Goodnight My Love COL performer VAL Ray Peterson	COL video title VAL Brenda Lee - What'd I Say (1964) - with Jimmy Page COL description VAL #BrendaLeeRocks Our channel tradition is "videos only"\, but we make an exception for this audio track. In 1964\, Brenda Lee was in London at the invitation of the Queen of England. She sang "All the Way" at the Royal Variety Performance show. In search of an updated sound\, she also met with Mickie Most who was the hot producer at the time. They chose "Is It True?" as the A-side of a single and Brenda picked "What'd I Say" as the B-side. She wanted to be the first female to cover Ray Charles controversial 1959 hit. "Is It True?" was top twenty on both sides of the Atlantic and earned a Gold Record. "What'd I Say" was a minor hit in some countries. Meanwhile\, in the United States\, the marketing geniuses at the evil record company decided to replace "What'd I Say" with "Just Behind The Rainbow" for the US release. Apparently\, Brenda Lee was Little Miss Adult Contemporary to them and nothing so raw as this track could be allowed. As a result\, "What'd I Say" was never released in the States.  Track Info Recorded at the Decca #2 Studios at 165 Broadhurst Gardens\, West Hampstead\, North London on 17 August 1964 and the demos went out to the radio stations the very next day on 18 Aug 1964. Brenda made 11 promotional appearances for the single.  "Is It True?" entered British charts the week of 9/16/64.  Personnel: Arthur Greenslade (1923 –2003) (piano)\, Jimmy Page(1944-  ) later of Led Zeppelin (guitar)\, Big Jim Sullivan (1941 - 2012)  (guitar); Bobby Graham (1940 -- 2009) (drums)\, Alan Weighell (1922 –2002) (bass)\, Stan Barrett (percussion); Terry Johnson (sound engineer)\, Reg Guest (1930- arranger)\, Mickie Most (born Michael Hayes 1938 -- 2003) (producer).  Bobby Graham recalled the session: "Some acts stood out\, either because they put so much into the recordings. ....... Brenda Lee really did perform. Mickie Most produced that record ('Is It True') at Decca\, they wanted this English sound. John Carter and Kenny Lewis wrote the song\, and also did backing vocals. Jimmy Page and Jim Sullivan were on guitar\, Alan Weighell was on bass\, Stan Barrett on percussion and myself on drums.The arranger was Reg Guest. For the B side\, 'What I'd Say'. we were messing around\, somebody started the lick\, Brenda jumped in and Mickie Most said 'let's record that'. It was done in one take". Note: Graham is mistaken about 'What I'd Say' being a spur of the moment decision. Brenda herself says she wanted to do it and I can't imagine they would go into the session without a "B" side.   Availability UK Import album - Ace CHCHD-1222 "The Queen Of Rock 'N' Roll"  Released 2009  German Import album - Bear Family BFB10025 "Brenda Lee Rocks" Released June 14\, 2011  A session anecdote: Mickie Most recalled that Brenda Lee was late getting to the studio. It turned out that the car sent to pick her up had broken down. Mickie worried that time was short for the usual amount of takes. His fears were allayed when Brenda arrived and ran through "Is It True?". Most told the NME reporter "it sounded like she had been singing it all her life!".  At three years old\, Brenda Mae Tarpley needed to hear a song only once or twice in order to sing it back in perfect pitch and rhythm. This is according to her mother and older sister. Of course\, the Nashville session players had grown used to this extraordinary facility and it was common for them to lay down four to six tracks in one 3 Hr session. When she recorded outside of Nashville\, producers were always amazed at how few tries were needed for a Brenda Lee recording.  SG Barnard recollection:  I was lucky enough to be in the recording studio when Mickie Most produced this song for her. Jimmy Page's guitar sounds good as ever. Mickie insisted that the whole company joined in the choruses for 'What'd I Say'. Such amazing times! RIP Mickie\, industry genius.  NB: SG Barnard was Brenda's Press Officer in the UK. She posted on another YouTube video: "She [Brenda] was the most professional act I ever worked with".   Songwriter: Ray Charles  Alright\, hey hey\, what'd I say\, what'd I say Well\, see the girl with the red dress on\, She can do the boogie all night long All right\, hey\, hey All right\, hear me what'd I say.

COL title VAL Younger Than Springtime COL performer VAL Nelson Riddle and His Orchestra	COL video title VAL Ferrante & Teicher - Scarborough Fair (4/12) COL description VAL Ferrante & Teicher were a duo of American piano players\, known for their light arrangements of familiar classical pieces\, movie soundtracks\, and show tunes.  Scarborough Fair Trad. arr. Ferrante & Teicher  United Artists 6725  Arthur Ferrante (September 7\, 1921\, New York City -- September 19\, 2009)\, and Louis Teicher (August 24\, 1924\, Wilkes-Barre\, Pennsylvania -- August 3\, 2008) met while studying at the Juilliard School of Music in New York. Musical prodigies\, they began performing as a piano duo while still in school. After graduating\, they both joined the Juilliard faculty.  Steven Tyler of Aerosmith relates the story that in the 1950's the two students practiced in the home of his grandmother Constance Neidhart Tallarico.  In 1947\, they launched a full-time concert career\, at first playing nightclubs\, then quickly moving up to playing classical music with orchestral backing. Between 1950 and 1980\, they were a major American easy listening act\, and scored four big U.S. hits: "Theme From The Apartment" (Pop #10)\, "Theme From Exodus" (Pop #2)\, "Tonight" (Pop #8)\, and "Midnight Cowboy" (Pop #10). They performed and recorded regularly with pops orchestras popular standards by George Gershwin\, Jerome Kern\, Cole Porter\, Richard Rodgers and others. In 1973\, they did the Hollywood Radio Theater theme for the Rod Serling radio drama series\, The Zero Hour.  The duo also experimented with prepared pianos\, adding paper\, sticks\, rubber\, wood blocks\, metal bars\, chains\, glass\, mallets\, and other found objects to piano string beds. In this way they were able to produce a variety of bizarre sounds that sometimes resembled percussion instruments\, and at other times resulted in special effects that sounded as if they were electronically synthesized.  Both men were initiated as honorary members of Tau Kappa Epsilon at Central State University (now University of Central Oklahoma) while on tour.  Ferrante and Teicher ceased performing in 1989 and retired to Longboat Key and Siesta Key\, respectively\, both close to each other on the west coast of Florida. They continued to play together occasionally at a local piano store.  CDs of their music\, some of it not previously released\, have continued to appear.  Louis Teicher died in 2008\, three weeks before his 84th birthday. Arthur Ferrante died on September 19\, 2009 at 88 (he had once said he wanted to live one year for each piano key). Arthur is survived by his wife\, Jena; his daughter\, Brenda Eberhardt; and two granddaughters. COL channel name VAL MultiUriahheep	0

COL title VAL 'Round Midnight COL performer VAL Barry Harris Trio	COL video title VAL Chaka  Khans "Round Midnight!!!!!!!!!!!! COL description VAL ClassiKhan From Wikipedia\, the free encyclopedia ClassiKhan  Studio album by Chaka Khan Released October 5\, 2004 Genre Vocal\, Jazz Label Sanctuary Records (U.K.) Earthsong / AgU Music Group (U.S.) JVC Victor (Japan) Producer Ira Schickman Eve Nelson Chaka Khan Professional reviews Allmusic  [1] Chaka Khan chronology Dance Classics of Chaka Khan (1999) ClassiKhan (2004) The Platinum Collection (2006) ClassiKhan is the twelfth studio album by American R&B/funk singer Chaka Khan\, featuring the London Symphony Orchestra\, Produced and arranged by Eve Nelson and released in 2004 on the at the time still independent label Sanctuary Records in the U.K.\, on Earthsong/AgU Music Group in the U.S. and in 2005 also in Japan on JVC Victor. As Allmusic point out in their review\, with Khan's well-known affinity and acclaim for interpreting jazz standards in mind\, which through most of her career on the Warner Bros. label had been relegated to the backburner\, an album with the title ClassiKhan could at first glance very easily be mistaken for being a belated sequel to 1982's Echoes of an Era. While the album indeed does focus on jazz and swing standards like "Stormy Weather"\, "Hazel's Hips"\, "Round Midnight" and "Teach Me Tonight" it also features an eclectic selection of classics from other genres\, like pop culture favourites such as Broadway show tune "Hey Big Spender" from the musical Sweet Charity\, Peggy Lee's "Is That All There Is?" penned by Leiber & Stoller and even a 60's country and western classic in the form of Patsy Cline's "Crazy"\, written by Willie Nelson. ClassiKhan also features the themes of classic film favourites from Khan's youth\, "To Sir With Love" and the James Bond themes "Goldfinger" and "Diamonds Are Forever". The collection concludes with one new composition\, the ballad "I Believe"\, co-written by Khan and the album's producer Ira Shickman. The title ClassiKhan is naturally also a reference to Khan's accompaniment on the set. On the Echoes of an Era album it was a five-piece all-star jazz ensemble\, on ClassiKhan it is The New York All Star Musicians - but with the addition of the full London Symphony Orchestra\, conducted and arranged by Eve Nelson and with orchestrations by producer Ira Schickman and Gary Anderson. The album was mainly recorded at London's legendary Abbey Road Studios and it features guest appearances by among others pianist Joe Sample and percussionist Sheila E.\, best known for her work with Prince. ClassiKhan was both a critical and commercial success\, even reaching #42 on Billboard's R&B albums chart. COL channel name VAL ChakaFanTV	1

It was written about Jane Asher\, McCartney's girlfriend of five years\, "You don't look different\, but you have changed\," the lyrics declare\, reflecting his dissatisfaction with their relationship.  The Beatles recorded three versions of the song in October and November 1965. The original version recorded on 24 October was slower than the released version\, had a significantly different rhythm\, and lacked the "Why\, tell me why..." middle eight of the final version.  It was eventually released in 1996 on the Anthology 2 compilation.  The final version was recorded on 10 November with overdubs on 11 November and is the version included on Rubber Soul.      * Paul McCartney -- double-tracked vocal\, acoustic rhythm guitar\, bass\, lead guitar     * John Lennon -- harmony vocal\, acoustic rhythm guitar     * George Harrison -- guitar     * Ringo Starr -- drums\, tambourine\, Hammond organ  In other news\, I have added the lyrics to this song so you can sing along\, or perhaps learn the song!

There have been several covers of the song (including The Birds and Saint Etienne in English) but the most known is probably the 1996 cover recording by the French artist Mylène Farmer and the French-born musician Khaled. The Farmer/Khaled cover was performed during Farmer's 1996 concert tour. After three live performances\, the song was finally released as the first single from Farmer's second live album\, Live à Bercy on 29 April 1997\, and became a top five hit in Belgium.  Background and live performances  There is a studio version of this duet\, but it was never released. This studio version was performed in lip-sync in a single television show\, Tip top\, broadcast on a French channel and host by Éric Jean-Jean\, where Farmer was invited to promote her single "Comme j'ai mal". Previously\, the show proposed to Farmer a list of singers with whom she would sing a song. She chose Khaled and decided to perform a cover of Polnareff's song\, "La Poupée qui fait non"\, and the recording lasted four hours.  Interviewed by the French magazine Instant-Mag\, Thierry Rogen\, the sound engineer who has participated in the recording\, said: "I have participated in the single "La Poupée qui fait non" with Khaled. Laurant [Boutonnat] was absent. The recording was made in the studio Merga in Suresnes in the right mood. It has been very rapid. Mylène [Farmer] and Khaled were together for four hours in total".  Farmer said she chose the song because it was the first song she learned when she was a child\, and she loved Michel Polnareff's work. Khaled also said: "This is a common idea\, we wanted to sing together. We loved both Polnareff. Personally\, I think it's the first song I learned."  The live version\, which was released in 1997\, was performed only three nights (two in Geneva and the last at Bercy) as a duet on stage during the 1996 tour. This remained the only collaboration between two artists.  The two remixes available on the CD maxi and the promotional vinyl were produced by Mylène Farmer (this is the only time she has participated in remixes of one of her singles)\, in collaboration with Thierry Rogen. However\, these remixes have not been well appreciated by the singer's fans\, because almost all the words have disappeared.  When the song was released\, Khaled declared that he found Farmer very sympathetic.[8] However\, later\, he said he had felt used by her\, since she put herself forward all the time when they performed the song and were interviewed; according to a 2009 edition of Nouvel Observateur\, Khaled qualified this collaboration as a "trap".  Critical reception  The song generally received negative reviews. According to the author Erwan Chuberre\, the duo Khaled / Farmer "which blends the sun and the darkness is on the limit of credibility". "The two worlds [of both singers] really failed to merge and this cover is soon forgotten!" Instant-Mag considered as "absurd" the fact that the studio version was never released\, and found that the song "was much harmed by the remixes that accompany it\, in which we have as the hazy impression that Mylène was amused herself (and without supervision) to press the buttons on the console of Thierry Rogen".  In France\, the single debuted at a peak of number six on 3 May 1997. However\, like Farmer's previous top ten hits\, it dropped rather quickly and fell off the top 50 after eight weeks.  Surprisingly\, the song was a big success in Belgium\, where it had a better chart trajectory in the Ultratop 40 than in France. It appeared on the chart for a total of 18 weeks from 24 May 1997\, peaked at number five on 21 June\, and managed to remain for eight weeks in the top ten. The song ranked at number 41 in the End of year chart. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

COL title VAL I Only Have Eyes for You COL performer VAL Kayla Taylor Jazz	COL video title VAL Erroll Garner Trio - I Only Have Eyes For You (Savoy Records 1949) COL description VAL "I Only Have Eyes for You" is a popular song by composer Harry Warren and lyricist Al Dubin\, written in 1934 for the film Dames where it was introduced by Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler.  Erroll Louis Garner (June 15\, 1921 -- January 2\, 1977) was an American jazz pianist and composer known for his swing playing and ballads. His best-known composition\, the ballad "Misty"\, has become a jazz standard. Allmusic.com calls him "one of the most distinctive of all pianists" and a "brilliant virtuoso".  Born with his twin brother Ernest in Pittsburgh\, Pennsylvania\, to an African American family on June 15\, 1921\, Erroll began playing piano at the age of three. His elder siblings were taught piano by Miss Bowman. From an early age Erroll would sit down and play anything she'd demonstrated\, just like Miss Bowman\, his eldest sister Martha said. He attended George Westinghouse High School\, as did fellow pianists Billy Strayhorn and Ahmad Jamal. Garner was self-taught and remained an "ear player" all his life – he never learned to read music. At the age of seven\, he began appearing on the radio station KDKA in Pittsburgh with a group called the Candy Kids. By the age of 11\, he was playing on the Allegheny riverboats. At 14 in 1937\, he joined local saxophonist Leroy Brown.  He played locally in the shadow of his older pianist brother Linton Garner and moved to New York in 1944. He briefly worked with the bassist Slam Stewart\, and though not a bebop musician per se\, in 1947 played with Charlie Parker on the famous "Cool Blues" session. Although his admission to the Pittsburgh music union was initially refused because of his inability to read music\, they eventually relented in 1956 and made him an honorary member. Garner is credited with having a superb memory of music. After attending a concert by the Russian classical pianist Emil Gilels\, Garner returned to his apartment and was able to play a large portion of the performed music by recall.  Short in stature (5 ft 2 in)\, Garner performed sitting on multiple telephone directories.] Considering that his small hands could barely span an octave on the piano keyboard\, his rapid right-handed octave and chordal passages were all the more amazing. He was also known for his vocalizations while playing\, which can be heard on many of his recordings. He helped to bridge the gap for jazz musicians between nightclubs and the concert hall.  Garner made many tours both at home and abroad\, and produced a large volume of recorded work. He was\, reportedly\, The Tonight Show host Johnny Carson's favorite jazz musician\, appearing on Carson's show many times over the years.  Garner's first recordings were made in late 1944 at the apartment of Timme Rosenkrantz; these were subsequently issued as the five-volume Overture to Dawn series on Blue Note Records. His recording career advanced in the late 1940s when several sides such as "Fine and Dandy" and "Sweet 'n' Lovely" were cut. His 1955 live album Concert by the Sea was a best-selling jazz album in its day and features Eddie Calhoun on bass and Denzil Best on drums. This recording of a performance at the Sunset Center\, a former school in Carmel-by-the-Sea\, California\, was made using relatively primitive sound equipment\, but for George Avakian the decision to release the recording was easy. Other works include 1951's Long Ago and Far Away and 1974's Magician\, both of which see Garner perform a number of classic standards. Often the trio was expanded to add Latin percussion\, usually a conga.  In 1964\, Garner appeared in the UK on the music series Jazz 625 broadcast on the BBC's new second channel. The programme was hosted by Steve Race\, who introduced Garner's trio with Eddie Calhoun on bass and Kelly Martin on drums. Because Garner could not write down his musical ideas\, he used to record them on tape\, to be later transcribed by others.  Erroll Garner died from a cardiac arrest on January 2\, 1977. He is buried in Pittsburgh's Homewood Cemetery.  Erroll's accompanied by John Simmons (bass) and Alvin Stoller (drums).  Recorded in Los Angeles\, March 29\, 1949.

An early 1950s article tells us that though she was the youngest in the family of singers\, she was the first to make it a profession. Life found them in Springfield\, Missouri when she decided to form a duet team with a friend (Mary Genevie Brayfield "Bobby Faye") and called themselves the Faye Sisters and earned a spot on the staff of KWTO in Springfield. While at KWTO\, Boots was also a part of a female group that KWTO billed as the Hillbilly Belles...Boots and Idaho were also doing some songwriting. The 1950s article mentions that Boots had written such tunes as "Cry\, Cry\, Cry" and "Leave It To Jesus." Later on\, she and Idaho co-wrote such tunes as "Baby Sitter Blues" and "Crying My Heart With the Blues."   On the personal side\, Boots was married to Idaho in 1945. He passed away in 1993. They were the parents of four children. COL channel name VAL mrblindfreddy9999	0

No copyright infringement intended!  Ten years ago\, on a cold dark night\, Someone was killed 'neath the town hall light. There were few at the scene\, but they all did agree That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me.  She walks these hills In a long black veil. She visits my grave When the night winds wail  Nobody knows\, nobody sees. Nobody knows but me.  The Judge said "Son\, what is your alibi? if you were somewhere else\, then you won't have to die." I spoke not a word\, though it meant my life\, For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife.  She walks these hills In a long black veil. She visits my grave When the night winds wail  Nobody knows\, nobody sees. Nobody knows but me.  Now the scaffold is high\, and eternity's near. She stood in the crowd\, and shed not a tear. But sometimes at night\, when the cold wind moans In a long black veil\, she cries o'er my bones  She walks these hills In a long black veil. She visits my grave When the night winds wail  Nobody knows\, nobody sees. Nobody knows but me.  Nobody knows\, nobody sees. Nobody knows but me. COL channel name VAL Jane Doe	0

COL title VAL The Way We Were COL performer VAL Mari Nakamoto	COL video title VAL The Charlie Daniels Band - Old Chisholm Trail.wmv COL description VAL By the Light of the Moon - Campfire Songs (1997) In the 1970s\, fiddler Charlie Daniels was one of the few almost completely country-leaning artists to make a play on the mainstream rock market. He did splendidly for a while\, and the production values he learned playing in rock-inflected settings show clearly on his first kids recording. By the Light of the Moon is most surely a country recording\, but it has all the driving rhythmic energy of an elegantly mastered rock album. The drums sound fat and still crisp\, the guitars bright. Daniels's voice\, especially during the interludes where he speaks about the music\, reveals a timeworn huskiness that will charm kids looking for a cowboy to sing to them. The songs emphasize the old\, with "John Henry" and "I'm an Old Cowhand" standing out. The latter includes Daniels playing short fiddle solos that cut a nice\, fresh path through the tune. A sonically splashy session indeed\, By the Light of the Moon has enough old-timey vibrance to merit a spot in any roots-oriented kids collection.  Song Title    1. Get Along\, Little Dogies 3:26  2. Cowboy Logic 4:33  3. I'm an Old Cowhand (from the Rio Grande) 3:32  4. Old Chisholm Trail 4:47  5. Sixteen Tons 2:58  6. Back in the Saddle Again 3:11  7. John Henry 3:56  8. Top Hand 4:04  9.

A founding member of the group was Dionne Warwick\, who was later replaced by her aunt\, Cissy Houston. The Sweet Inspirations was founded by former members of The Drinkard Singers\, a long-running Gospel singing group whose membership included Cissy Houston (née Drinkard\, and mother of Whitney Houston\, 1963) and Lee Warwick\, who was Cissy's sister and the mother of Sweet Inspirations members Dee Dee and Dionne Warwick). As a backup group\, the Sweet Inspirations were in high demand among producers\, publishers\, artists\, and songwriters in the early 1960s. The original lineup included Doris Troy and the two Warwick sisters Dionne & Dee Dee. Sylvia Shemwell (sister of Judy Clay) replaced Troy\, while Cissy Houston took over from Dionne\, with Dee Dee Warwick as the group's official leader. The group sang backup for many stars\, including Solomon Burke\, Aretha Franklin\, Wilson Pickett\, and Esther Phillips. Dee Dee left in 1965\, when her solo career began to take off. She was replaced by Myrna Smith. Estelle Brown joined the team soon after\, and the line-up that was to become an Atlantic recording group was set. The Sweet Inspirations recorded by themselves for the first time in April 1967 for Atlantic Records. That session produced the first two singles released by Atlantic\, a version of "Why (Am I Treated So Bad)\," a song previously recorded by The Staple Singers and a soulful version of "Let It Be Me"\, a French song which had been a pop and R&B hit for Betty Everett & Jerry Butler in 1964.

Bang\, bang\, Maxwell's silver hammer Came down upon her head Bang\, bang\, Maxwell's silver hammer Made sure that she was dead  Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again Teacher gets annoyed Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away So he waits behind Writing 50 times "I must not be so-o-o-oo..." But when she turns her back on the boy He creeps up from behind  Bang\, bang\, Maxwell's silver hammer Came down upon her head Bang\, bang\, Maxwell's silver hammer Made sure that she was dead  B.C. Thirty-One said "we caught a dirty one" Maxwell stands alone Painting testimonial pictures ohh-oh-oh-oh Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery Say he must go free (Maxwell must go free) The judge does not agree and he tells them so-o-o-oo But as the words are leaving his lips A noise comes from behind  Bang\, bang\, Maxwell's silver hammer Came down upon his head Bang\, Bang\, Maxwell's silver hammer Made sure that he was dead COL channel name VAL PropertyOfFrodo	0

They both possessed immediately identifiable sounds\, were veterans of Count Basie's Orchestra and never had any difficulty swinging. The repertoire of this Edison album is not too creative with five blues among its eight songs and one of the others\, "Feelings\," being quite forgettable. However\, the playing of the principals (along with pianist Dolo Coker who also makes a couple of surprising appearances on electric keyboard) holds one's interest throughout.

For entertainment/promotional purposes only. Enjoy the music!  This song is from the 2008 cd entitled "Ramblin' Son" by Julian Fauth.  Very real storytelling talent on top of amazing piano skills. Julian is a real interesting Toronto based singer & piano player.  His blues style is more of a traditional 'pre-war barrelhouse blues & boogie-woogie with infusions of gospel & jazz'.  I really love how he tells a story with his music.  He plays quite often in the Toronto area so check him out if you can.

COL title VAL You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling COL performer VAL Barry Mann	COL video title VAL Delaney and Bonnie - "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'" (Genesis LP) COL description VAL by Delaney & Bonnie. From the "Genesis" LP  For an album that is clearly a compilation of older material meant to capitalize on the fame from Delaney & Bonnie's 1971 hits on Atco\, The "Genesis" LP is a true find! There are only three tracks from the duo\, all produced by Leon Russell; the nine other titles are Delaney Bramlett solo\, six produced by Jackie DeShannon\, three others with no producer credited. Despite the slight deception -- that this is a Delaney Bramlett album with three bonus tracks by the hit group -- the disc still works on its own. DeShannon has Delaney sounding like Gene Pitney on "Tomorrow Never Comes\," while "Heartbreak Hotel" and Ray Charles' "I Got a Woman" have him emulating Elvis. On the uncredited production of "Lonely Me\," Mr. Bramlett goes for an early John Lennon vocal style\, then veers off to Gerry and the Pacemakers territory on his originals\, "Without Your Love" and "Better Man Than Me\," quite revealing in that they are so different from the music Jimmy Miller produced for the group when Delaney & Bonnie on Tour With Eric Clapton emerged. Jackie DeShannon's pop production kicks in again with "Liverpool Lou\," and it is back to that Gene Pitney sound. COL channel name VAL BobSeger1981	1

COL title VAL Stel nu dat jij niet bestond COL performer VAL Monza	COL video title VAL Bing Crosby - Brother Can You Spare A Dime? 1932 COL description VAL This was a #1 Hit. Harry Lillis "Bing" Crosby (May 3\, 1903 -- October 14\, 1977) was an American singer and actor. "Brother\, Can You Spare a Dime?"\, also sung as "Buddy\, Can You Spare a Dime?"\, is one of the best-known American songs of the Great Depression. Written in 1931 by lyricist E. Y. "Yip" Harburg and composer Jay Gorney\, "Brother\, Can You Spare a Dime?" was part of the 1932 musical New Americana; the melody is based on a Russian lullaby Gorney heard as a child. It became best known\, however\, through recordings by Bing Crosby and Rudy Vallee. Both versions were released right before Franklin Delano Roosevelt's election to the presidency and both became number one hits on the charts. The Brunswick Crosby recording became the best-selling record of its period\, and came to be viewed as an anthem of the shattered dreams of the era. The song asks why the men who built the nation -- built the railroads\, built the skyscrapers -- who fought in the war (World War I)\, who tilled the earth\, who did what their nation asked of them should\, now that the work is done and their labor no longer necessary\, find themselves abandoned\, in bread lines. It refers to "Yankee Doodle Dum"\, a reference to patriotism\, and the evocation of veterans also recalls military bonuses\, which were a topical issue. The song has unusual structure for a Broadway song. Firstly\, rather than starting in a major key\, as most Broadway songs do\, it begins in a minor key\, which is darker\, and more appropriate for the Depression. When discussing the prosperous past and building the railroads\, the song jumps an octave and moves briefly into a major key\, evoking energy and optimism. It then reverts to a minor key in the word "time" in the line "Once I built a railroad\, made it run / Made it race against time\," marking the end of prosperous times\, and changing to a wistful mood. The song then ends\, not on a note of resignation\, but with anger -- repeating the beginning (as is usual for Broadway songs)\, an octave higher\, but with a significant change: the friendly "Brother\, can you spare a dime?" is replaced with the aggressive "Buddy\, can you spare a dime?"

COL title VAL White Christmas COL performer VAL Queensrÿche	COL video title VAL The Holly and the Ivy COL description VAL “The Holly and the Ivy”\, this distinctive\, ancient\, British carol is heard on Allison Crowe’s new Christmas collection\, “Souling”.  http://music.allisoncrowe.com/album/souling  Allison Crowe’s gorgeous voice brings tidings of comfort and joy with “Souling” – her 11th full album release.  The artist\, one of our greatest living musicians\, singer-songwriters and performers\, has always created authentic music.  With this newest song set her voice is heard wholly a cappella.  The songs themselves have a purity of expression – a 21st century take on music of faith and spirit – sounds and themes aired by carollers and soulers of old.  The genesis of “Souling” is found in the bond Allison Crowe’s formed with the creative family at Theatre Newfoundland and Labrador. Founded in 1979\, this professional theatre company presents a dynamic and diverse repertoire of plays and maintains\, as well\, a strong commitment to youth theatre in the Atlantic Canada community.  For these past three Summers TNL’s engaged Crowe as Musical Director of “Newfoundland Vinyl” - a perennial favourite at the annual Gros Morne Theatre Festival. Following another hit season at GMTF\, in late August of this year TNL Artistic Associate SaraH McDonald invited the Corner Brook\, NL-based musician to serve the same role with a vibrant production of “A Christmas Carol”.  The Adaptation of this classic Charles Dickens story by playwright Jeff Pitcher\, TNL’s Artistic Director\, excited Crowe’s musical imagination – as did the desire of McDonald\, the play’s Director\, to incorporate songs in the style of Victorian Era carollers.  So inspired\, Allison Crowe immersed herself in curating the music for the abundantly-talented\, multi-aged\, choir of singers who performed in “A Christmas Carol” at the Corner Brook Arts and Culture Centre from November 27th – 30th\, 2014.  This artistic process of selection and arrangement led to her recording solo versions of those songs that will receive another distinct breath of life from the TNL vocal ensemble.  (In parallel fashion\, the first season’s run of “Newfoundland Vinyl” brought forth Allison Crowe’s album of the same name – one of 2013’s top recordings. Culture blog Muruch praised it as a “lovely\, vintage collection of traditional Irish and Canadian folk ballads\, lively sea chanteys and drinking songs\, parlour songs and country tunes” possessing “unique charm” and “the timeless beauty of a classic folk album”.)  In 2003\, (and expanded in 2004)\, Allison Crowe released Tidings – an album of singular interpretations - “River” (Joni Mitchell)\, “Hallelujah” (Leonard Cohen)\, “In My Life” (The Beatles) and more from the secular canon – alongside such favourite traditional carols as “Silent Night”\, “The First Noel”\, and “O Holy Night”. Tidings has proven to be a modern classic – “music for the season and all time”.  This time out\, as befits TNL’s telling of “A Christmas Carol”\, Allison Crowe gives pure voice to the sacred songbook. “Souling” is:  Soul Cake I Saw Three Ships That Night in Bethlehem (Don Oíche úd i mBeithil) God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen The Wexford Carol The Holly and the Ivy In the Bleak Midwinter (Cranham) Ding Dong Merrily on High Once in Royal David’s City Wassail Song  “Souling” is available now via Allison Crowe’s own website @ http://music.allisoncrowe.com/album/souling as well as on iTunes @ https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/souling/id933188580 plus CD Baby @ http://cdbaby.com/cd/allisoncrowe10 and all major digital music outlets worldwide.

Noel\, Noel\, Noel\, Noel Born is the King of Israel!  They looked up and saw a star Shining in the East beyond them far And to the earth it gave great light And so it continued both day and night. Noel\, Noel\, Noel\, Noel Born is the King of Israel!  And by the light of that same star Three Wise men came from country far To seek for a King was their intent And to follow the star wherever it went. Noel\, Noel\, Noel\, Noel Born is the King of Israel!  This star drew nigh to the northwest O'er Bethlehem it took it's rest And there it did both Pause and stay Right o'er the place where Jesus lay. Noel\, Noel\, Noel\, Noel Born is the King of Israel!  Then entered in those Wise men three Full reverently upon their knee And offered there in His presence Their gold and myrrh and frankincense. Noel\, Noel\, Noel\, Noel Born is the King of Israel!  Then let us all with one accord Sing praises to our heavenly Lord That hath made Heaven and earth of nought And with his blood mankind has bought.

Este famosíssimo bolero foi escrito em 1940 pela compositora Consolo Velázquez com 24 anos e como ela mesma confessou\, quando ainda não tinha sido beijada. É uma das canções mais populares do século XX e em 1999 foi reconhecida como a mais cantada\, reproduzida e gravada em espanhol. Também é considerada a mais traduzida\, com versões em mais de 20 idiomas THE HI-LO'S The Hi-Lo's were an a cappella quartet formed in 1953. The group's name is reportedly a reference to their extreme vocal and physical ranges (Bob Strasen and Bob Morse were tall\, Gene Puerling and Clark Burroughs were short). Besame Mucho Sunny Skylar - Consuelo Velazquez - Recorded August 7\, 1961 - Arranged by Gene Puerling Consuelo Velásquez Torres (Ciudad Guzmán/Zapotlán el Grande\, Jalisco\, 21 de agosto de 1924 -- Cidade do México\, 22 de janeirode 2005) foi uma pianista e compositora mexicana. Bésame mucho (em português Beija-me muito) é o título de uma canção escrita em 1940 pela mexicana Consuelo Velásquez antes de completar seu 16° aniversário. Segundo Consuelo Velázquez\, ela inspirou-se em uma ária de uma ópera de Enrique Granados. Rapidamente a canção se converteu em uma das mais populares do século XX. Emilio Tuero foi o primeiro a gravar-la. Em 1999\, a canção foi reconhecida com a mais cantada e gravada do idioma espanhol\, e talvez seja a mais traduzida entre as compostas nesta língua. (Wikipedia) Há mais de 2000 gravações diferentes. Cantores brasileiros que gravaram: Francisco Alves\, Clara Nunes\, Leila Pinheiro\, Rosa Passos\, Maysa Matarazzo\, Alda Rezende\, Cauby Peixoto\, Ney Matogrosso.. A gravação mais recente é do conjunto MPB 4\, Muitos cantores de jazz já gravaram como Diana Krall. Temos ainda gravações de The Beatles\, Elvis Presley\, Frank Sinatra\, entre centenas de intérpretes de jazz\, cantores ou instrumentistas de renome.  Besame Mucho Maysa Bésame\, bésame mucho Como si fuera esta la noche La última vez  Bésame\, bésame mucho Que tengo miedo a perderte Perderte después  Quiero tenerte muy cerca Mirarme en tus ojos Verte junto a mí Piensa que tal vez mañana Yo ya estaré lejos Muy lejos de aquí  Bésame\, bésame mucho Como si fuera esta la noche La última vez  Bésame\, bésame mucho Que tengo miedo a perderte Perderte después  Bésame\, bésame mucho Besame\, besame mucho\,  Each time I cling to your kiss\, I hear music divine\,  Besame mucho\,  Hold me my darling and say that you'll always be mine.  This joy is something new\, my arms enfolding you\,  Never knew this thrill before.  Whoever thought I'll be holding you close to me\,  Whispering it's you I adore.  Dearest one\, if you should leave me\,  Each little dream would take wing and my life would be through\,  Besame mucho\, love me forever and make all my dreams come true.. Besame\, besame mucho\,  Como si fuera esta noche la ultima vez.  Besame\, besame mucho\,  Que tengo miedo tenerte y perderte depues.  Quiero tenerte muy cerca mirarme en tus ojos estar junto de ti.  Pienso que tal vez maana estarte muy lejos muy lejos de ti.  Besame\, besame mucho\,  Como si fuera esta noche la ultima vez.  Besame\, besame mucho\,  Que tengo miedo tenerte y perderte despues.

COL title VAL Meglio stasera COL performer VAL Fran Jeffries	COL video title VAL Oh Well - Oh Well COL description VAL No one knows who these guys are\, so I thought I'd post their songs. From Wikipedia\, the free encyclopedia  Oh Well were a UK dance group that started in the late 1980s. They were relatively successful during their peak in 1989\, but broke up soon after\, due to lack of chart success thereafter.  The group had two UK chart singles in 1989 and 1990: the eponymous "Oh Well" single was released in late 1989 and peaked at number 28 on the UK Singles Chart for two weeks\, starting on October 28. Their second single\, a cover of Golden Earring's "Radar Love"\, was released in early 1990 and debuted and peaked at number 63 on March 3.  The band can be referred to as a "one hit wonder"\, seeing as how they only had one single reach the Top 40. "Oh Well" was featured on Now That's What I Call Music! 16\, the sixteenth volume of the popular British hits series. COL channel name VAL 3Life3	0

COL title VAL All Through the Night COL performer VAL Sheryl Crow	COL video title VAL The Sweet Inspirations - Let It Be Me COL description VAL Info: The Sweet Inspirations were an American R&B girl group mostly known for their work as backup singers on studio recordings for other R&B and rock artists. A founding member of the group was Dionne Warwick\, who was later replaced by her aunt\, Cissy Houston. The Sweet Inspirations was founded by former members of The Drinkard Singers\, a long-running Gospel singing group whose membership included Cissy Houston (née Drinkard\, and mother of Whitney Houston\, 1963) and Lee Warwick\, who was Cissy's sister and the mother of Sweet Inspirations members Dee Dee and Dionne Warwick). As a backup group\, the Sweet Inspirations were in high demand among producers\, publishers\, artists\, and songwriters in the early 1960s. The original lineup included Doris Troy and the two Warwick sisters Dionne & Dee Dee. Sylvia Shemwell (sister of Judy Clay) replaced Troy\, while Cissy Houston took over from Dionne\, with Dee Dee Warwick as the group's official leader. The group sang backup for many stars\, including Solomon Burke\, Aretha Franklin\, Wilson Pickett\, and Esther Phillips. Dee Dee left in 1965\, when her solo career began to take off. She was replaced by Myrna Smith. Estelle Brown joined the team soon after\, and the line-up that was to become an Atlantic recording group was set. The Sweet Inspirations recorded by themselves for the first time in April 1967 for Atlantic Records. That session produced the first two singles released by Atlantic\, a version of "Why (Am I Treated So Bad)\," a song previously recorded by The Staple Singers and a soulful version of "Let It Be Me"\, a French song which had been a pop and R&B hit for Betty Everett & Jerry Butler in 1964.

COL title VAL I Walk the Line COL performer VAL Gunilla Thorn	COL video title VAL Ella Fitzgerald - Cry Me A River (Verve Records 1961) COL description VAL "Cry Me a River" is a popular American torch song\, written by Arthur Hamilton and first published in 1953\, and made famous in the version by Julie London\, 1955.  A jazzy blues ballad\, "Cry Me a River" was originally written for Ella Fitzgerald to sing in the 1920s-set film\, Pete Kelly's Blues (released 1955) but the song was dropped. It has been said that it was dropped because\, at the time of Ella's recording\, film and record producers said that the audience would not believe that a "colored/black" person would know what the word Plebeian meant nor would they use it. They were afraid that Ella's vocals combined with the use of such an "intelligent" word would upset their target audience.  Fitzgerald first released a recording of the song on Clap Hands\, Here Comes Charlie! in 1961.   The song's first release and most famous recording was by actress/singer Julie London in 1955\, backed by Barney Kessel on guitar and Ray Leatherwood on bass. A sultry performance of the song by London in the 1956 film The Girl Can't Help It helped to make it a million-selling blockbuster (#9 US/#22 UK). London's recording was later featured in the soundtrack's for the movies 'Passion of Mind (2000)\, and V for Vendetta (2005).  Barbra Streisand sang this song on her 1963 debut album as the opening track of Side 1. In 1970\, British blues rocker Joe Cocker made the chart with an upbeat rock rendition on the album\, Mad Dogs and Englishmen. In 1995\, British actress Denise Welch's double A-side "You Don't Have to Say You Love Me" / "Cry Me a River" spent three weeks in the UK Singles Chart\, reaching #23. Canadian jazz pianist and singer Diana Krall recorded the song on her 2001 album\, The Look of Love. In 2009\, Canadian singer Michael Bublé entered the charts with a big-band jazz version\, which is also the opening track of his fourth album Crazy Love. This adaption of the song was used in the BBC's advertising and theme music for coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.  Ella Jane Fitzgerald (April 25\, 1917 – June 15\, 1996) was an American jazz vocalist with a vocal range spanning three octaves (D♭3 to D♭6). Often referred to as the "First Lady of Song\," the "Queen of Jazz" and "Lady Ella\," she was noted for her purity of tone\, impeccable diction\, phrasing and intonation\, and a "horn-like" improvisational ability\, particularly in her scat singing.  Fitzgerald was a notable interpreter of the Great American Songbook. Over the course of her 60-year recording career\, she sold 40 million copies of her 70-plus albums\, won 13 Grammy Awards and was awarded the National Medal of Arts by Ronald Reagan and the Presidential Medal of Freedom by George H. W. Bush.  Ella's accompanied by Lou Levy (piano); Herb Ellis (guitar); Joe Mondragon (bass); and Gus Johnson (drums).  Recorded June 23\, 1961\, Los Angeles (Verve Records)  Now you say you're lonely You cried the long night through Well\, you can cry me a river Cry me a river I cried a river over you Now you say you're sorry For being so untrue Well\, you can cry me a river Cry me a river I cried a river over you You drove me\, Nearly drove me out of my head While you never shed a tear Remember?

David  Drummer Gerry Gibbs has been living a recurring dream with slight variations for the past few years. In December of 2012\, he laid down tracks with two of his idols—the legendary Ron Carter and the estimable Kenny Barron—and dubbed their group the Thrasher Dream Trio. The eponymous debut from that band\, featuring fifteen tracks recorded at those sessions\, was\, not surprisingly\, a strong and classy affair filled with standards\, some originals\, and other jazz-friendly fare\, such as Stevie Wonder's "Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing" and Burt Bacharach's "Promises\, Promises."   At the time of that album's release\, those last-mentioned tracks could simply be viewed as part of the well-rounded program. But looking back now\, it actually seems like they were dropped as hints of what was to come. About a year-and-a-half after that first Thrasher Dream Trio album was recorded\, Gibbs brought the band together again to lay things down for We're Back (Whaling City Sound\, 2014)\, a jazz-does-R&B project with A-list guests—vibraphonist Warren Wolf\, saxophonist Steve Wilson\, and organist Larry Goldings. That album offered multiple helpings of Wonder and Earth\, Wind & Fire along with single servings of Bacharach\, Marvin Gaye\, Miles Davis\, and the Average White Band. As on the trio's first album\, the sparks were flying. The playing field\, however\, had changed a bit.   For this\, the third go-around for this group\, Gibbs does it again\, tweaking the formula without altering the essence of the trio. This time he turned the focus toward pop-ish material from the '50s and '60s—the work of Bacharach\, Henry Mancini\, Michel Legrand\, and others of that ilk—and put an audience in front of the band\, recording live at Systems Two Recording Studio. Guests are part of the package again—now it's trumpeter Roy Hargrove and vocalist Cassandra Wilson\, each appearing on a few tracks—and they help to add another wrinkle or two to the project without drawing focus away from the trio.   The album opens on a fluid "Wives And Lovers" that allows Barron's lyricism to shine through\, gives Carter a chance to step into the spotlight\, and puts Gibbs' brushwork at center stage. From there\, the trio moves on with an unusually upbeat take on "The Summer Knows\," a Wilson-enhanced version of "The Look Of Love" that moves from bossa nova to swing\, and a variety of other familiar hits of yesteryear. Hargrove joins in for "On A Clear Day\," quoting Ellington at one point and playfully trading solos with Gibbs; Vince Guaraldi's cheerfulness shines through on a perky trio performance of his "Cast Your Fate To The Wind"; "More" is transformed from a stale confection into an enjoyable swinger; and "Watch What Happens" happens twice—first as a cheerful\, Brazilian-based instrumental\, then as a swing-centered feature for Wilson.   Along the way there are plenty of other bright spots—an appropriately noir-ish "What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life?" with Hargrove on flugelhorn\, a leisurely stroll through "Girl Talk"—and plenty of moments that serve as simple reminders as to why Barron and Carter are loved\, respected\, and emulated the world over. Their time and taste are impeccable\, and when married to Gibbs' in-the-tradition drumming\, you know the music is going to go in the right direction every time.

COL title VAL Slowly COL performer VAL Bonnie Guitar	COL video title VAL ABBEY LINCOLN little Niles (1958) COL description VAL Album : it's magic Tune written by Jon Hendricks / Randy Weston  Because Abbey Lincoln has always been careful to sing songs that have a deep meaning for her\, all of her recordings through the years are memorable in their own way; there are no duds in her discography. Her second Riverside session (and her third recording)\, It's Magic has been reissued on this CD in the Original Jazz Classics series. The backup musicians are among the best in jazz at the time (Kenny Dorham or Art Farmer on trumpet\, trombonist Curtis Fuller\, Benny Golson on tenor\, Jerome Richardson or Sahib Shihab on reeds\, pianist Wynton Kelly\, Paul Chambers or Sam Jones on bass\, and drummer Philly Joe Jones) and they have opportunities to play short solos. Lincoln is heard at her early best on such numbers as "I Am in Love\," "An Occasional Man\," "Out of the Past" and Randy Weston's "Little Niles." Recommended. COL channel name VAL OubaelPhoumet	0

Arf! ‎-- AA-015 Format: Vinyl\, 7"\, Single Country: US Released: 1985  Tracklist A In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida B The Smelly Fishy Theme And Variations  ------------------------  "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" is a song by Iron Butterfly\, released on their 1968 album In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida.  At slightly over 17 minutes\, it occupies the entire second side of the In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida album. The track was recorded on May 27\, 1968\, at Ultrasonic Studios in Hempstead\, Long Island\, New York. The single reached number 30 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.  Overview  The song is considered significant in rock history because\, together with music by Blue Cheer\, Jimi Hendrix and Steppenwolf\, it marks the time period when psychedelic music began to form heavy metal. In 2009\, it was named the 24th greatest hard rock song of all time by VH1.  In popular culture  Television  The Simpsons at the beginning of the episode "Bart Sells His Soul"\, under the guise of a church hymn distributed by Bart\, with the title "In the Garden of Eden" (referencing the popular story about the mondegreen) by "I. Ron Butterfly"\, and sung by the unwitting parishioners. Reverend Lovejoy suddenly points out that this sounds a lot like "rock and/or roll!". After a 17 minute skip\, the organist collapses from fatigue.  In the first episode of Bobby's World\, "The Visit To Aunt Ruth's"\, Martha Generic states that there's no sign of civilization on the way to Aunt Ruth's. Bobby daydreams about the stone age featuring a prehistoric version of Iron Butterfly.  Home Improvement in the episode "Flying Sauces"\, Brad and Randy attempt to convince their younger brother Mark that they were actually aliens\, whose alien parents would arrive to retrieve them from the backyard in the middle of the night. The boys' parents Tim and Jill arrange a counter-prank by blaring the song while using spotlights to give the appearance of a UFO\, before emerging dressed as aliens to chase the terrified duo around the yard.  That 70's Show Fez and Hyde smuggle the record into Fez's house by putting it in a Pat Boone album cover.  Criminal Minds at the beginning of season 1 episode "The Tribe".

The A Team episode "Beneath the Surface" background music during a party scene.  Beavis and Butt-head\, season 4\, episode 32: the title is referred to on TV.  The Wonder Years Season 3 episode "Night Out". Playing when Kevin and Winnie Cooper are headed to the "Makeout Room" at their first couple's party.  Futurama Season 6 episode "In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela"\, a spoof on the song's title.  House Season 3 episode "The Jerk". The song is playing while a patient is on a monitored mushroom trip to relieve cluster headaches.  Film  Manhunter climax. Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare briefly. Resident Evil Extinction road trip sequence. Ocean's Twelve replay of staged fight in train. Mike Mendez' Killers opening song.  Music  The song is a part of "Polkas on 45" from 1984\, the first of "Weird Al" Yankovic's numerous polka medleys.  Nas' song "Thief's Theme" featured an interpolation of the famous riff from "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" performed by Incredible Bongo Band. Nas would use the same sample again on the 2006 single "Hip Hop Is Dead".  Frank Zappa spoofed the song with a track called In-A-Gadda-Stravinsky.  On the Rollins Band album Do It\, at roughly 5 minutes and 15 seconds into the song "Move Right In"\, the band breaks into the familiar riff from "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"\, playing it for roughly a minute before returning to the original song.  Blind Guardian - Fly - 03 - In a gadda da vida (Iron Butterfly cover)  In Ricky Martin's song Livin' La Vida Loca\, this song is referenced slightly in the end.  In the Chase song "Get it On: (1971)\, the brass instruments quote the last six notes from "In-A Gadda Da-Vida" to end the song. It was not clear whether Iron Butterfly sued Chase for plagiarizing the song  Books  John Ringo \, author of several military Sc-Fi series regularly uses a playlist to be enjoyed when reading the books. In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida is referenced there and some of his more musical minded protagonists play it.

COL title VAL Charade COL performer VAL Monica Mancini	COL video title VAL Roy Head - Pledging my love COL description VAL The song\, of course\, is the famous blues ballad which became a posthumous hit for Johnny Ace in 1955 after his self-inflicted accidental gunshot wound. It was written by Ferdinand Washington and Don Robey (of Duke Records)\, not Johnny Ace himself.  At this stage in his career Huey Meaux was trying various musical suits on Roy to see what might catch the public ear. This was the country Roy announced by the pedal steel as soon as the record starts.  This\, and other tracks\, come from the album "Country Crooner" which was issued in 1999 on Edsel as one of their Crazy Cajun series of albums which pulled together recordings produced by Huey P Meaux in Houston in the late '60's and '70's. Meaux used the Crazy Cajun name for one of a series of labels which he operated in the timeframe.  Roy Head had his one and only hit for Huey Meaux in 1965 with "Treat Her Right" which is rightly regarded as a classic of blue-eyed soul.  For a variety of reasons Roy didn't manage to follow this record up successfully. He drifted between labels until he came under control of Meaux again in\, I think\, the mid seventies. Two albums were issued of his music\, "Boogie Down" and "Rock'n'Roll My Soul". Edsel issued two albums in 1999 covering music from those albums\, the aforementioned "Country Crooner" and "White Texas Soul Shouter". I assume Edsel's intention was to cover the more soul and R&B oriented in the latter and the C&W ones in the former. The recordings themselves were apparently spread over a wide period from the late '60's through to the mid '70's.   The musicians present on most of these tracks were:  Dahrull Norris - Drums Ira Wilkes - Bass Peter Schless - Keyboards\, Synthesiser Lee O'Neil - Keyboards\, Synthesiser\, Arrangements Mike Pietzsch - Guitar Uncle Mickey Moody - Guitar\, Arrangements Lynn Groom - Guitar The Merlene Singers - Background vocals COL channel name VAL DangerousDaveRR	0

This is the band's best known album and is notable for its inclusion of "Breadfan"\, the band's best-known song. Metallica recorded a cover version of "Breadfan" in 1988.

COL title VAL A Taste of Honey COL performer VAL John Davidson	COL video title VAL Bonnie Dobson - A taste of honey COL description VAL from the album 'Good Morning Rain' in 1970   By the time she moved permanently to London in 1970\, Canadian Bonnie Dobson had a pretty susbtantial career under her belt: four albums on the Prestige label including the song for which shes best known (Walk me out in the) Morning Dew plus two on RCA Victor.  Born in Toronto in 1940\, she got into folk seriously as a teenager on summer camps where people like Pete Seeger and Leon Bibb would turn up to give concerts. She got her break in 1960\, left university and started touring in the States.  I did my first tour with Brownie McGee and Sonny Terry who had been my idols and then I was playing with them\, she recalled in 1993. And then I went off to Los Angeles. There was a festival up in Idlewild\, the University of California had this arts festival every summer and I taught Canadian folk songs. I never got back to University. I just kept going and eventually I hit New York.  Grief over theft What followed were those six albums\, years of touring and lots of grief over her song Morning Dew being stolen by Tim Rose. In November 1969 she made her London debut at the Queen Elizabeth Hall\, and settled in the city the following year.   Lost Ladies of Folk She recorded just this one album for Argo\, then one for Polydor in 1976 (Morning Dew)\, followed by a few singles in the early eighties. Since then its been pretty much reissues\, retrospectives and compilations.  She had in fact called it quits I didnt feel I was growing\, I didnt feel I was doing anything. I just seemed to be doing the same things over and over again and I thought some people are happy to do that\, I wasnt. So I thought Ill go back and get my degree. Once back in the university world\, she stayed\, working as an administrator in the Philosophy Department of Birkbeck College\, London.  In 2007\, 28 years after she made her UK debut there\, she was persuaded back on to the stage at Queen Elizabeth Hall by Jarvis Cocker\, who was running a Lost Ladies of Folk night as part of his Meltdown curatorship. By all accounts she was on fine form. COL channel name VAL andrijadragon	1

COL title VAL Little Boxes COL performer VAL Randy Newman	COL video title VAL Roy Head - Pledging my love COL description VAL The song\, of course\, is the famous blues ballad which became a posthumous hit for Johnny Ace in 1955 after his self-inflicted accidental gunshot wound. It was written by Ferdinand Washington and Don Robey (of Duke Records)\, not Johnny Ace himself.  At this stage in his career Huey Meaux was trying various musical suits on Roy to see what might catch the public ear. This was the country Roy announced by the pedal steel as soon as the record starts.  This\, and other tracks\, come from the album "Country Crooner" which was issued in 1999 on Edsel as one of their Crazy Cajun series of albums which pulled together recordings produced by Huey P Meaux in Houston in the late '60's and '70's. Meaux used the Crazy Cajun name for one of a series of labels which he operated in the timeframe.  Roy Head had his one and only hit for Huey Meaux in 1965 with "Treat Her Right" which is rightly regarded as a classic of blue-eyed soul.  For a variety of reasons Roy didn't manage to follow this record up successfully. He drifted between labels until he came under control of Meaux again in\, I think\, the mid seventies. Two albums were issued of his music\, "Boogie Down" and "Rock'n'Roll My Soul". Edsel issued two albums in 1999 covering music from those albums\, the aforementioned "Country Crooner" and "White Texas Soul Shouter". I assume Edsel's intention was to cover the more soul and R&B oriented in the latter and the C&W ones in the former. The recordings themselves were apparently spread over a wide period from the late '60's through to the mid '70's.   The musicians present on most of these tracks were:  Dahrull Norris - Drums Ira Wilkes - Bass Peter Schless - Keyboards\, Synthesiser Lee O'Neil - Keyboards\, Synthesiser\, Arrangements Mike Pietzsch - Guitar Uncle Mickey Moody - Guitar\, Arrangements Lynn Groom - Guitar The Merlene Singers - Background vocals COL channel name VAL DangerousDaveRR	0

COL title VAL Tenderly COL performer VAL Bob James Trio	COL video title VAL Rosemary Clooney - Tenderly - 1952 COL description VAL "Tenderly" is a Pop standard published in 1946 with music by Walter Lloyd Gross (1909-1967) and lyrics by Jack Lawrence.   "Tenderly" has been recorded by many famous artists\, but possibly the best-known version is by Rosemary Clooney. Her recorded version reached only #17 on the Billboard magazine pop charts in early 1952\, but is more popular than the chart data would suggest\, as is evidenced by the fact that Tenderly served as the theme song for Clooney's 1956-1957 TV variety show. It also became her signature song.  I consciously came to know of the song in the late 1970's while watching a Bing Crosby Special; Rosemary\, a guest star on the show\, sang it and it just took my breath away; I immediately realized that I had heard the song before\, and it brought vivid memories of my childhood and my mother. It is because of this that I made this video - A way to pay tribute to this great artist\, song and to the beautiful memory of my late mother. It is to her that I dedicate this song and I know she watches from a better place. COL channel name VAL boopkid	1
COL title VAL You Ain't Going Nowhere COL performer VAL Cliff Waldron and The New Shades of Grass	COL video title VAL 1920s Chicago Jazz: Jimmie Noone's Apex Club Orch. - I Know That You Know COL description VAL Jimmie Noone's Apex Club Orchestra (Jimmie Noone\, clarinet; Joe Poston alto sax; Earl Hines\, piano; Buddy Scott\, banjo; Johnny Wells\, drums) -- I Know That You Know (V.Youmans /A.Caldwell)\, Brunswick 1937 (Originally recorded by Vocalion\, 1928)   NOTE: Jimmie NOONE (b.1895 Cut Off\, Louisiana -- d. 1944 in LA\, California) American jazz clarinetist who is regarded as one of the greatest jazz clarinetists\, along with Johnny Dodds\, Benny Goodman and Sidney Bechet. Noone's playing is lyrical and sophisticated\, and certainly makes more use of "sweet" flavoring. Noone was an important influence on later clarinetists such as Artie Shaw and Benny Goodman. He started playing guitar in his home town and at the age of 15\, he switched to the clarinet and moved to New Orleans. He studied with Lorenzo Tio and with the young Sidney Bechet\, who was only 13 at the time. By 1912\, he was playing professionally with Kid Ory\, Papa Celestin\, the Eagle Band before joining the Original Creole Orchestra in Chicago in 1917. The following year\, he joined King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band\, then in 1926\, he started leading the band at Chicago's Apex Club\, the Jimmie Noone's Apex Club Orchestra\, in which the influential pianist Earl Hines was playing for a time. In  1943 he moved to Los Angeles\, where he died suddenly of a heart attack. The Kid Ory's band played for him the blues titled "Blues for Jimmie" on the radio\, and the number eventually became a regular feature for the Ory band. COL channel name VAL 240252	0

COL title VAL Go Your Own Way COL performer VAL The String Quartet	COL video title VAL ♥ "The Way of Love" - by Kathy Kirby COL description VAL UPDATE: May 20\, 2011 -- It's in the news that this lovely artist joined her Creator today.  Peace be unto her..... - Originally uploaded in my previous channel (65Reasons) on June 16\, 2008. It is being re-uploaded with some updates... - "The Way of Love" Composer: Jacques Dieval English Lyrics: Al Stillman   The lyricist for the French version "J'ai le mal de toi" is Michel Rivegauche.  The song was originally written in French under the name 'J'ai le mal de toi' and recorded by Lili Castel for the song competition "Musik Ohne Grenzen" on the Belgian radio (BRT).   The French lyrics were written by Michel Rivgauche.   In 1965\, it was released as a single by Kathy Kirby in English. Curiously\, while this single failed to chart in her native United Kingdom\, where Kirby placed several singles on the charts in the mid-60's\, it became her only song to place on Billboard Hot 100. The song's lyrics were penned from a male point of view. Kirby's rendition does not change the perspective\, creating a story in which the subject to whom she sings has left her for a male.  "The Way of Love" was later recorded by Cher. Her version hit number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 in February 1972.   - Enjoy! - COL channel name VAL 65Seasons	0

On the critically acclaimed 52nd Street\, Fields convincingly demonstrates an unforgettable tableau of 11 wonderful songs from the jazz\, pop\, blues\, and Brazilian jazz genres in which the listener can delight. Accompanied by an array of jazz stars\, including Jeff Lorber\, this is simply a superb recording due to Fields' flawless vocals\, poetic imagination\, and soulful phrasings on such songs as "Maria\," "And I Love Her" featuring Gerald Albright\, the smooth jazz rendition of "A Night in Tunisia" featuring Chris Botti\, and "Open Your Heart" featuring the Oakland Interfaith Youth Gospel Choir. Victor Fields has marvelously timed his lyrics to compliment the breathtaking manner of saxophonist Albright and trumpeter Botti with his masterful tenor range and tells two exceptionally well-told musical stories that are filled with colorful nuance\, imaginative shadings\, and sensual scattings. Fields and Claudia Villela brilliantly transform Toots Thielemans' "Bluesette" into a Brazilian samba that is both lyrical and buoyant. With 52nd Street\, Victor Fields' sensuous\, sexy\, but sunny vocals have put many jazz vocalists in the shade. Top pick: "Five-Two Blues" featuring John R. Burr. COL channel name VAL dc grooves	0

COL title VAL My Man COL performer VAL Xavier Cugat and His Orchestra	COL video title VAL ♥ "The Way of Love" - by Kathy Kirby COL description VAL UPDATE: May 20\, 2011 -- It's in the news that this lovely artist joined her Creator today.  Peace be unto her..... - Originally uploaded in my previous channel (65Reasons) on June 16\, 2008. It is being re-uploaded with some updates... - "The Way of Love" Composer: Jacques Dieval English Lyrics: Al Stillman   The lyricist for the French version "J'ai le mal de toi" is Michel Rivegauche.  The song was originally written in French under the name 'J'ai le mal de toi' and recorded by Lili Castel for the song competition "Musik Ohne Grenzen" on the Belgian radio (BRT).   The French lyrics were written by Michel Rivgauche.   In 1965\, it was released as a single by Kathy Kirby in English. Curiously\, while this single failed to chart in her native United Kingdom\, where Kirby placed several singles on the charts in the mid-60's\, it became her only song to place on Billboard Hot 100. The song's lyrics were penned from a male point of view. Kirby's rendition does not change the perspective\, creating a story in which the subject to whom she sings has left her for a male.  "The Way of Love" was later recorded by Cher. Her version hit number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 in February 1972.   - Enjoy! - COL channel name VAL 65Seasons	0

L'auteur de L'écume des jours a su trouver les mots qui sonnent avec grâce. La direction musicale de Laurent De Wild est un "Voyage au Paradis".  Libération -- 2009 -- Bruno Pfeiffer -- Diane chante Vian tel que -- Un météore a explosé la surface tranquille de la lune : son dernier disque "Docteur Boris et Mister Vian". Le travail enduit de baume les oreilles\, puis le reste de la carcasse. C'est tout simplement extra... Un régal. Vian n'aurait sans doute pas hésité à applaudir « Rue de la flemme ». Quel concentré de swing relâché! Quel modèle de grande chanson (tour de force de la traduction)! Pourquoi  citer seulement  le savoureux « Voyage au Paradis » ? Les onze valent le coup. Le disque passe comme un remède à l'imbécillité de la période actuelle... La profondeur légère de l'interprétation s'offre comme un cadeau. Les chorus de Laurent de Wilde\, huit ou seize mesures maxi\, ne goinfrent pas la mise en place. La complicité de l'ensemble se ressent du respect flagrant que se portent les artistes. Le prochain qui me classe Diane Tell dans la variété\, je l'enjoins : jazzons les idées préconçues.

TESTO DELLA CANZONE E BIOGRAFIA DELL'INTERPRETE  TESTO: Tornerai / da me perché l'unico sogno sei / del mio cuor. Tornerai / tu perché senza i tuoi baci languidi / non vivrò. Ho qui dentro ognor la tua voce che dice / tremando "amor". Tornerò / perché tuo è il mio cuor.  Tu sai che t'amo: / non ho che te mi stai lontano: / dimmi perché? La nostalgia / non senti in cuor? Non ti ricordi di me? Questa mia vita / non può durar\, tu sei fuggita / devi tornar: questo mio cuor / ti vuole ancor.  Tornerò / perché tuo è il mio cuor.  BIOGRAFIA (da ildiscobolo.net)  Si chiamava il realtà Guido Di Luca ed era nato a Livorno nel 1903. Dopo una attivissima carriera radiofonica (fu tra l'altro in radio uno dei tre moschettieri nella celebre rubrica degli anni '30) e discografica che lo videro incidere decine di 78 giri  prevalentemente per la Parlophon quando questa etichetta era in Italia prodotta e distribuita dalla Cetra.   Emigrò negli anni cinquanta negli Stati Uniti \, ove continuò a lavorare come attore\, spesso affiancato da nomi molto noti dello spettacolo americano. Morì \, proprio negli USA nel 1991.   Fu tra l'altro il marito della nota attrice Lilla Brignone\, scomparsa nel 1984\, conosciuta proprio alla radio durante la lavorazione di una delle tante commedie radiofoniche ale quali partecipò.   Molte le incisioni da lui realizzate affiancato dal Trio delle sorelle Lescano : Balliamo il passo Lambeth Bimba mia non mi resistere Casetta mia Disillusione Giovanotti Girotondo dell'amore Il maestro innamorato La ragazza del giornale Ladro d'amore Son tutte belle Un anno di baci Un po' di sole Una ninna-nanna COL channel name VAL Melodieantiche	0

COL title VAL When I Fall in Love COL performer VAL Anne Murray with Celine Dion	COL video title VAL Willie Dixon - Back door man COL description VAL "Back Door Man" is a blues song written by Willie Dixon for Howlin' Wolf\, released by Chess Records as a B-side to Wolf's "Wang Dang Doodle" in 1961. The song's author Willie Dixon recorded it on his 1970 album I Am The Blues.  In southern culture\, the phrase "back-door man" refers to a man having an affair with a married woman\, using the back door as an exit before the husband comes home. The phrase "back-door man" dates from the 1920s\, but the term became a double entendre in the 1960s\, also meaning "one who practices anal intercourse."  The song became an early standard cover song of The Doors and they recorded it for their 1967 debut album.

COL title VAL Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word COL performer VAL Elton John	COL video title VAL Roy Head - Pledging my love COL description VAL The song\, of course\, is the famous blues ballad which became a posthumous hit for Johnny Ace in 1955 after his self-inflicted accidental gunshot wound. It was written by Ferdinand Washington and Don Robey (of Duke Records)\, not Johnny Ace himself.  At this stage in his career Huey Meaux was trying various musical suits on Roy to see what might catch the public ear. This was the country Roy announced by the pedal steel as soon as the record starts.  This\, and other tracks\, come from the album "Country Crooner" which was issued in 1999 on Edsel as one of their Crazy Cajun series of albums which pulled together recordings produced by Huey P Meaux in Houston in the late '60's and '70's. Meaux used the Crazy Cajun name for one of a series of labels which he operated in the timeframe.  Roy Head had his one and only hit for Huey Meaux in 1965 with "Treat Her Right" which is rightly regarded as a classic of blue-eyed soul.  For a variety of reasons Roy didn't manage to follow this record up successfully. He drifted between labels until he came under control of Meaux again in\, I think\, the mid seventies. Two albums were issued of his music\, "Boogie Down" and "Rock'n'Roll My Soul". Edsel issued two albums in 1999 covering music from those albums\, the aforementioned "Country Crooner" and "White Texas Soul Shouter". I assume Edsel's intention was to cover the more soul and R&B oriented in the latter and the C&W ones in the former. The recordings themselves were apparently spread over a wide period from the late '60's through to the mid '70's.   The musicians present on most of these tracks were:  Dahrull Norris - Drums Ira Wilkes - Bass Peter Schless - Keyboards\, Synthesiser Lee O'Neil - Keyboards\, Synthesiser\, Arrangements Mike Pietzsch - Guitar Uncle Mickey Moody - Guitar\, Arrangements Lynn Groom - Guitar The Merlene Singers - Background vocals COL channel name VAL DangerousDaveRR	0

From Wikipedia\, the free encyclopedia  Oh Well were a UK dance group that started in the late 1980s. They were relatively successful during their peak in 1989\, but broke up soon after\, due to lack of chart success thereafter.  The group had two UK chart singles in 1989 and 1990: the eponymous "Oh Well" single was released in late 1989 and peaked at number 28 on the UK Singles Chart for two weeks\, starting on October 28. Their second single\, a cover of Golden Earring's "Radar Love"\, was released in early 1990 and debuted and peaked at number 63 on March 3.  The band can be referred to as a "one hit wonder"\, seeing as how they only had one single reach the Top 40. "Oh Well" was featured on Now That's What I Call Music! 16\, the sixteenth volume of the popular British hits series. COL channel name VAL 3Life3	0

I have placed the song here to try to bring more attention to the release. It seems that many are unaware of it's existence. Support the artist and get the download from Itunes\, Amazon\, etc.  Bettye LaVette - vocals  Alan Hill - piano  John Heard: Bass  Danny Frankel: percussion  Tom Hagerman: strings & string arrangements   Produced & mixed by Rob Schnapf  Recorded at Sonara Recorders  Mastered by Mark Chalecki at Little Red Book Mastering   Song writing credits:  Change Is Gonna Come - Sam Cooke   Round Midnight - Thelonious Monk   God Bless The Child - Billie Holiday / Arthur Herzog   Lush Life - Billy Strayhorn   Ain't No Sunshine - Bill Withers   Ain't That Lovin' You - Jimmy Reed  Official Press Release  Having conquered the ghosts of a hard-luck past on her GRAMMY-nominated CD The Scene of the Crime\, BETTYE LAVETTE shines a new light on that past with her latest\, A CHANGE IS GONNA COME SESSIONS. The digital-only EP for Anti- Records\, available exclusively through iTunes starting June 16\, revisits BETTYE's forgotten post-Atlantic Records years as a nightclub singer\, Broadway performer\, and touring cast member opposite Cab Calloway in "Bubbling Brown Sugar."    The EP opens with a stirring solo version of Sam Cooke's posthumous Civil Rights anthem "A Change Is Gonna Come\," a song which BETTYE sang with Jon Bon Jovi in January as part of the "We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial" concert. Joining BETTYE for these Sessions are pianist and musical director Al Hill\, veteran bassist John Heard -- who has accompanied such luminaries as Count Basie\, Cole Porter\, Ella Fitzgerald\, and Art Pepper -- drummer Danny Frankel (k.d. lang\, Lou Reed)\, and Tom Hagerman from DeVotchKa on strings.    A mix of standards and soul classics from BETTYE's 1970s stage and nightclub repertoire rounds out the 6-song set\, including songs by Thelonious Monk\, Duke Ellington\, Bill Withers\, and Jimmy Reed. A rendition of Billie Holiday's "God Bless The Child" -- a song that BETTYE first performed with show-stopping magnificence in "Bubbling Brown Sugar" -- highlights BETTYE's vocal mastery. Rather than attack\, BETTYE approaches these tracks with subtlety -- while nonetheless wresting every ounce and every nuance of meaning from the words she sings. Once more\, BETTYE provides the definitive answer to the question posed by NPR in its review of The Scene of the Crime: "Is there any soul singer who brings more guts\, more conviction and more emotion to her singing?" Absolutely not. COL channel name VAL imnokid	0

COL title VAL Falling Slowly COL performer VAL Simon Bailey & Sabrina Aloueche	COL video title VAL Erroll Garner Trio - I Only Have Eyes For You (Savoy Records 1949) COL description VAL "I Only Have Eyes for You" is a popular song by composer Harry Warren and lyricist Al Dubin\, written in 1934 for the film Dames where it was introduced by Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler.  Erroll Louis Garner (June 15\, 1921 -- January 2\, 1977) was an American jazz pianist and composer known for his swing playing and ballads. His best-known composition\, the ballad "Misty"\, has become a jazz standard. Allmusic.com calls him "one of the most distinctive of all pianists" and a "brilliant virtuoso".  Born with his twin brother Ernest in Pittsburgh\, Pennsylvania\, to an African American family on June 15\, 1921\, Erroll began playing piano at the age of three. His elder siblings were taught piano by Miss Bowman. From an early age Erroll would sit down and play anything she'd demonstrated\, just like Miss Bowman\, his eldest sister Martha said. He attended George Westinghouse High School\, as did fellow pianists Billy Strayhorn and Ahmad Jamal. Garner was self-taught and remained an "ear player" all his life – he never learned to read music. At the age of seven\, he began appearing on the radio station KDKA in Pittsburgh with a group called the Candy Kids. By the age of 11\, he was playing on the Allegheny riverboats. At 14 in 1937\, he joined local saxophonist Leroy Brown.  He played locally in the shadow of his older pianist brother Linton Garner and moved to New York in 1944. He briefly worked with the bassist Slam Stewart\, and though not a bebop musician per se\, in 1947 played with Charlie Parker on the famous "Cool Blues" session. Although his admission to the Pittsburgh music union was initially refused because of his inability to read music\, they eventually relented in 1956 and made him an honorary member. Garner is credited with having a superb memory of music. After attending a concert by the Russian classical pianist Emil Gilels\, Garner returned to his apartment and was able to play a large portion of the performed music by recall.  Short in stature (5 ft 2 in)\, Garner performed sitting on multiple telephone directories.] Considering that his small hands could barely span an octave on the piano keyboard\, his rapid right-handed octave and chordal passages were all the more amazing. He was also known for his vocalizations while playing\, which can be heard on many of his recordings. He helped to bridge the gap for jazz musicians between nightclubs and the concert hall.  Garner made many tours both at home and abroad\, and produced a large volume of recorded work. He was\, reportedly\, The Tonight Show host Johnny Carson's favorite jazz musician\, appearing on Carson's show many times over the years.  Garner's first recordings were made in late 1944 at the apartment of Timme Rosenkrantz; these were subsequently issued as the five-volume Overture to Dawn series on Blue Note Records. His recording career advanced in the late 1940s when several sides such as "Fine and Dandy" and "Sweet 'n' Lovely" were cut. His 1955 live album Concert by the Sea was a best-selling jazz album in its day and features Eddie Calhoun on bass and Denzil Best on drums. This recording of a performance at the Sunset Center\, a former school in Carmel-by-the-Sea\, California\, was made using relatively primitive sound equipment\, but for George Avakian the decision to release the recording was easy. Other works include 1951's Long Ago and Far Away and 1974's Magician\, both of which see Garner perform a number of classic standards. Often the trio was expanded to add Latin percussion\, usually a conga.  In 1964\, Garner appeared in the UK on the music series Jazz 625 broadcast on the BBC's new second channel. The programme was hosted by Steve Race\, who introduced Garner's trio with Eddie Calhoun on bass and Kelly Martin on drums. Because Garner could not write down his musical ideas\, he used to record them on tape\, to be later transcribed by others.  Erroll Garner died from a cardiac arrest on January 2\, 1977. He is buried in Pittsburgh's Homewood Cemetery.  Erroll's accompanied by John Simmons (bass) and Alvin Stoller (drums).  Recorded in Los Angeles\, March 29\, 1949.

COL title VAL Mother Machree COL performer VAL Sam Moore [1]\, Piano Acc. Frank Banta	COL video title VAL Ferrante & Teicher - Scarborough Fair (4/12) COL description VAL Ferrante & Teicher were a duo of American piano players\, known for their light arrangements of familiar classical pieces\, movie soundtracks\, and show tunes.  Scarborough Fair Trad. arr. Ferrante & Teicher  United Artists 6725  Arthur Ferrante (September 7\, 1921\, New York City -- September 19\, 2009)\, and Louis Teicher (August 24\, 1924\, Wilkes-Barre\, Pennsylvania -- August 3\, 2008) met while studying at the Juilliard School of Music in New York. Musical prodigies\, they began performing as a piano duo while still in school. After graduating\, they both joined the Juilliard faculty.  Steven Tyler of Aerosmith relates the story that in the 1950's the two students practiced in the home of his grandmother Constance Neidhart Tallarico.  In 1947\, they launched a full-time concert career\, at first playing nightclubs\, then quickly moving up to playing classical music with orchestral backing. Between 1950 and 1980\, they were a major American easy listening act\, and scored four big U.S. hits: "Theme From The Apartment" (Pop #10)\, "Theme From Exodus" (Pop #2)\, "Tonight" (Pop #8)\, and "Midnight Cowboy" (Pop #10). They performed and recorded regularly with pops orchestras popular standards by George Gershwin\, Jerome Kern\, Cole Porter\, Richard Rodgers and others. In 1973\, they did the Hollywood Radio Theater theme for the Rod Serling radio drama series\, The Zero Hour.  The duo also experimented with prepared pianos\, adding paper\, sticks\, rubber\, wood blocks\, metal bars\, chains\, glass\, mallets\, and other found objects to piano string beds. In this way they were able to produce a variety of bizarre sounds that sometimes resembled percussion instruments\, and at other times resulted in special effects that sounded as if they were electronically synthesized.  Both men were initiated as honorary members of Tau Kappa Epsilon at Central State University (now University of Central Oklahoma) while on tour.  Ferrante and Teicher ceased performing in 1989 and retired to Longboat Key and Siesta Key\, respectively\, both close to each other on the west coast of Florida. They continued to play together occasionally at a local piano store.  CDs of their music\, some of it not previously released\, have continued to appear.  Louis Teicher died in 2008\, three weeks before his 84th birthday. Arthur Ferrante died on September 19\, 2009 at 88 (he had once said he wanted to live one year for each piano key). Arthur is survived by his wife\, Jena; his daughter\, Brenda Eberhardt; and two granddaughters. COL channel name VAL MultiUriahheep	0

It has a twelve bar blues progression\, using only three chords until the coda.  In addition to Neal Hefti's original version\, and the television soundtrack version by Nelson Riddle\, versions were covered by The Marketts (single "Batman Theme" and album The Batman Theme by The Marketts)\, The Ventures (The Ventures Play the "Batman" Theme\, Dolton BST8042\, 3/1966)\, Al Hirt\, The Standells and actor/musician David McCallum.  The song has been widely parodied in the decades since its debut. The theme has been re-recorded by dozens of artists\, including Link Wray\, Voivod\, The Jam\, and The Who.  Adaptations  Jan & Dean on their 1966 album\, Jan And Dean Meet Batman. The Who recorded a cover of the theme in 1966.  The Kinks played a cover of the theme at their show at Kelvin Hall\, Glasgow\, in 1967. Adrian Henri and his band Liverpool Scene did a skit of the theme in the late 60s using Henri's poem Batpoem. The Jam covered the "Batman Theme" on their debut album\, In the City in 1977. In 1966\, an album called Batman and Robin: The Sensational Guitars of Dan and Dale was released featuring members of the Sun Ra Arkestra and The Blues Project. The opening track is a cover of the "Batman Theme". Prince and R.E.M. used variations of the TV show theme in their work: Prince in the song "Batdance" (which appeared on the soundtrack to Tim Burton's 1989 movie)\, and R.E.M. in a rejected song for the Batman Returns soundtrack\, later released under the title "Winged Mammal Theme"\, as a B-side to the single "Drive".

COL title VAL Coração Vagabundo COL performer VAL Morelenbaum² / Sakamoto	COL video title VAL Willie Dixon - Back door man COL description VAL "Back Door Man" is a blues song written by Willie Dixon for Howlin' Wolf\, released by Chess Records as a B-side to Wolf's "Wang Dang Doodle" in 1961. The song's author Willie Dixon recorded it on his 1970 album I Am The Blues.  In southern culture\, the phrase "back-door man" refers to a man having an affair with a married woman\, using the back door as an exit before the husband comes home. The phrase "back-door man" dates from the 1920s\, but the term became a double entendre in the 1960s\, also meaning "one who practices anal intercourse."  The song became an early standard cover song of The Doors and they recorded it for their 1967 debut album.

Although they are stylistically very different\, there are many overlaps in their bodies of work\, which makes for an interesting comparison/contrast.

It peaked at number three on UK Singles Chart and became their highest charting single in the U.S.\, peaking at number six.  Background  Gouldman wrote the song at the age of 19 while working by day in a gentlemen's outfitters near Salford Docks and playing by night with the semi-professional Manchester band the Mockingbirds. He said: "I was sleeping most of the time because I'd been gigging with the Mockingbirds the night before\, and then during the day when I'd got any spare time I'd write in the shop. I used to shut up the shop at lunch time and sit in the back writing."  Gouldman cited The Beatles as his influence by saying "We went down to Denmark Street and went round all the publishers trying to find a song . . . we didn't get any songs that we liked or we weren't given any songs period and the Beatles had started and I thought 'well\, I'm gonna really have a crack at song-writing.' I had dabbled a bit\, but they were really my inspiration and gave me and I think a lot of other people the courage to actually do it. We all wanted to be like the Beatles. I wrote two songs and the record company we were with turned down one of the songs. The song they turned down was 'For Your Love'\, which eventually found its way to the Yardbirds."  Gouldman's manager\, Harvey Lisberg\, was so impressed by the song he told Gouldman they should offer it to the Beatles. "I said\, 'I think they're doing alright in the songwriting department\, actually'\," Gouldman recalled. Undeterred\, Lisberg gave a demo of the song to publisher Ronnie Beck of Feldman's\, who took it to the Hammersmith Odeon\, where the Beatles were performing. By coincidence the Yardbirds were also performing on a Christmas show at the venue and Beck played the song to their manager\, Giorgio Gomelsky\, and the band.  In 1965 the Mockingbirds began a regular warm-up spot for BBC TV's Top of the Pops\, transmitted from Manchester. Gouldman recalled: "There was one strange moment when The Yardbirds appeared on the show doing 'For Your Love'. Everyone clamoured around them -- and there I was just part of an anonymous group. I felt strange that night\, hearing them play my song."  Despite the success "For Your Love" gave the Yardbirds\, it signaled the departure of guitarist Eric Clapton\, who played on the track with strong reluctance. Dismayed with the group's shift from R&B to pop\, Clapton left to join John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers.  Dave Liebman has told the story on stage that the harpsichords introduction was a total accident. He was hired to write an organ riff intro for the song\, and upon arriving at the recording studio it was realized that there was no organ on site. They searched and all they could find was a harpsichord. Liebman crafted the intro for the Yardbirds\, but left before the recording was finished because he thought there would never be a hit rock song that featured a harpsichord!  Cover versions  A cover version by Peter Blakely is featured in the 1990 film The Crossing.  The song was also recorded by: Herman's Hermits\, Humble Pie\, The Greg Kihn Band\, Nils Lofgren\, Fleetwood Mac\, Chilly\, The Ace Kefford Stand\, Gary Lewis & the Playboys\, Claudja Barry\, Larry Williams and Graham Gouldman himself.  Led Zeppelin played it several times during early concert tours between 1968 and 1969 which is audible on bootlegged material.  Krishna Das performs a kirtan version titled "Narayana/For Your Love" on his 2010 album Heart as Wide as the World.  Appearances in popular culture  The song was featured in the 1998 film Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\, and in the 2009 film The Boat That Rocked. The song was also performed by Chaka Khan and Michael McDonald as the opening theme song for the sitcom of the same name. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	1

There have been several covers of the song (including The Birds and Saint Etienne in English) but the most known is probably the 1996 cover recording by the French artist Mylène Farmer and the French-born musician Khaled. The Farmer/Khaled cover was performed during Farmer's 1996 concert tour. After three live performances\, the song was finally released as the first single from Farmer's second live album\, Live à Bercy on 29 April 1997\, and became a top five hit in Belgium.  Background and live performances  There is a studio version of this duet\, but it was never released. This studio version was performed in lip-sync in a single television show\, Tip top\, broadcast on a French channel and host by Éric Jean-Jean\, where Farmer was invited to promote her single "Comme j'ai mal". Previously\, the show proposed to Farmer a list of singers with whom she would sing a song. She chose Khaled and decided to perform a cover of Polnareff's song\, "La Poupée qui fait non"\, and the recording lasted four hours.  Interviewed by the French magazine Instant-Mag\, Thierry Rogen\, the sound engineer who has participated in the recording\, said: "I have participated in the single "La Poupée qui fait non" with Khaled. Laurant [Boutonnat] was absent. The recording was made in the studio Merga in Suresnes in the right mood. It has been very rapid. Mylène [Farmer] and Khaled were together for four hours in total".  Farmer said she chose the song because it was the first song she learned when she was a child\, and she loved Michel Polnareff's work. Khaled also said: "This is a common idea\, we wanted to sing together. We loved both Polnareff. Personally\, I think it's the first song I learned."  The live version\, which was released in 1997\, was performed only three nights (two in Geneva and the last at Bercy) as a duet on stage during the 1996 tour. This remained the only collaboration between two artists.  The two remixes available on the CD maxi and the promotional vinyl were produced by Mylène Farmer (this is the only time she has participated in remixes of one of her singles)\, in collaboration with Thierry Rogen. However\, these remixes have not been well appreciated by the singer's fans\, because almost all the words have disappeared.  When the song was released\, Khaled declared that he found Farmer very sympathetic.[8] However\, later\, he said he had felt used by her\, since she put herself forward all the time when they performed the song and were interviewed; according to a 2009 edition of Nouvel Observateur\, Khaled qualified this collaboration as a "trap".  Critical reception  The song generally received negative reviews. According to the author Erwan Chuberre\, the duo Khaled / Farmer "which blends the sun and the darkness is on the limit of credibility". "The two worlds [of both singers] really failed to merge and this cover is soon forgotten!" Instant-Mag considered as "absurd" the fact that the studio version was never released\, and found that the song "was much harmed by the remixes that accompany it\, in which we have as the hazy impression that Mylène was amused herself (and without supervision) to press the buttons on the console of Thierry Rogen".  In France\, the single debuted at a peak of number six on 3 May 1997. However\, like Farmer's previous top ten hits\, it dropped rather quickly and fell off the top 50 after eight weeks.  Surprisingly\, the song was a big success in Belgium\, where it had a better chart trajectory in the Ultratop 40 than in France. It appeared on the chart for a total of 18 weeks from 24 May 1997\, peaked at number five on 21 June\, and managed to remain for eight weeks in the top ten. The song ranked at number 41 in the End of year chart. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

A couple other times when the Sabbath was right  Was a man with-a dropsy and a man born blind  Peter’s feverish mother-in-law and a demoniac  And Bethesda with the man who had the mat   Oh\, don’t give us none of your bad religion  I’ve had it with you hypocrites  Sabbath day's quite alright for nice things get a little practice in  Man\, they're gettin' spoiled now that Jesus came  God just heals ‘em left and right  And Sabbath day's quite all right for Christ  Sabbath day's quite alright\, alright\, alright\, ooh  Mark 3:4  Then Jesus asked them\, "Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil\, to save life or to kill?"

With his signing to Warner/Reprise\, he begins a new chapter in an amazing career that spans nearly four decades  Lyrics: Well\, you wouldn't read my letters if I wrote you You asked me not to call you on the phone There's something I've been waiting for to tell you So I wrote it in the words of this song You never knew there were honky tonk angels Or you might have known I'd never make a wife You walked out on the only one who ever loved you So I went back to the wild side of life Now the glamor of the good life always lead me To the places where the wild liquor flows I tried to be your one and only angel But I'm not that kind of angel\, heaven knows I cried so hard the day you went and left me 'Cause some things you said\, they cut me like a knife What you wanted was another kind of angel And you should be back to the wild side of life No\, well\, I guess I'm just a honky tonk angel I might have known I'd never make a wife Well\, you left the only one who ever loved you And I'm back here on the wild side of life I'm only a honky tonk angel I might have known I'd never make a wife You walked out on the only one who ever loved you And you left me here on the wild side of life --  (C) 1960 GRT Records COL channel name VAL Country At Its Finest	0

COL title VAL Have You Ever Seen the Rain? COL performer VAL Bonnie Tyler	COL video title VAL Carl Smith No One Will Ever Know COL description VAL Success in the 1950s  In 1951\, his song "Let's Live a Little" was a big hit\, reaching No. 2 on country chart. During 1951 he had up three other hits\, including "If the Teardrops Were Pennies" and his first No. 1 hit\, "Let Old Mother Nature Have Her Way".  The songs made Smith a well-known name in country music. His band\, the Tunesmiths\, featured steel guitarist Johnny Silbert\, who added an element of Western swing.   In 1952\, Smith married June Carter (who later became the wife of Johnny Cash)\, the daughter of Maybelle Carter of the Carter Family. In 1955 the couple had a daughter\, Rebecca Carlene Smith\, who later became known as Carlene Carter\, a country singer in her own right.  During the rest of the 1950s\, Smith made regular appearances on Billboard's country charts\, racking up many hits\, including 30 in the Top 10. His biggest hits include "Loose Talk"\, "Wicked Lies"\, "Hey Joe!" and "You Are the One". He had five No. 1 hits in his career; "Loose Talk" was his last\, in 1955. "Hey Joe!" got to Number 1 in the UK Singles Chart for Frankie Laine in October 1953 for two weeks.  Some of his songs had sharp edges\, fast phrasing and a strong drumbeat\, similar to rockabilly material making the charts in the mid-50s\, which in some ways made Smith's music closer to rock and roll than country. Some of his songs did\, however\, make the pop charts. His biggest pop entry was the song "Ten Thousand Drums" in 1959\, which reached No. 43 on the pop chart.  In 1956\, Smith quit the Grand Ole Opry. Soon after\, he joined The Phillip Morris Country Music Show and spent more than a year touring the United States\, often in direct competition with touring Opry shows. He also made regular appearances on ABC-TV's Jubilee USA and was a fill-in host for Red Foley.  In 1957\, Smith and June Carter divorced. That same year\, he appeared in the movie\, The Badge of Marshal Brennan and Buffalo Guns\, and married country music singer Goldie Hill\, best known for the No. 1 hit "I Let the Stars Get In My Eyes". Goldie retired from the music business. By the late 50s\, Smith's success began to dwindle on the country charts\, and soon his string of Top 10s turned into Top 20 hits.

It was written about Jane Asher\, McCartney's girlfriend of five years\, "You don't look different\, but you have changed\," the lyrics declare\, reflecting his dissatisfaction with their relationship.

COL title VAL Stackalee COL performer VAL Frank Hutchinson	COL video title VAL Pacific Gas And Electric - Staggolee COL description VAL Album : Are You Ready(1970) The band was formed in Los Angeles in 1967\, by guitarist Tom Marshall\, bassist Brent Block\, second guitarist Glenn Schwartz (previously of The James Gang) and drummer Charlie Allen\, who had previously played in the band Bluesberry Jam. When it became clear that Allen was the best singer in the new group\, he became the front man\, and Frank Cook\, previously of Canned Heat\, came into the band on drums. Originally known as the Pacific Gas and Electric Blues Band\, they shortened their name when they signed to Kent Records\, releasing the album Get It On in early 1968. The record was not a success\, but following the band's performance at the Miami Pop Festival in May 1968 they were signed by Columbia Records.[1][2] Their first album for Columbia\, Pacific Gas and Electric\, was issued in 1969\, but they achieved greater success with their next album\, Are You Ready in 1970. The title track reached # 14 on the Billboard Hot 100.[3] After the album was recorded\, Cook was injured in a car accident and was replaced on drums by Ron Woods\, Cook staying on as manager. Marshall and Schwartz left\, and were replaced by Frank Petricca (bass) and Ken Utterback (guitar)\, with Brent Block moving to rhythm guitar before leaving later in 1970. Unusually for the time\, the band contained both black and white musicians\, which led to rioting and gunfire on one occasion when the band\, who toured widely\, performed in Raleigh\, North Carolina.[1] In 1971\, the band changed their name to PG&E\, following pressure from the utility company of the same name. The band also expanded\, Allen\, Woods\, Petricca and Utterback being joined by Jerry Aiello (keyboards)\, Stanley Abernathy (trumpet)\, Alfred Galagos and Virgil Gonsalves (saxophones)\, and Joe Lala (percussion). They recorded the album PG&E\, and also appeared in and provided music for the Otto Preminger film Tell Me That You Love Me\, Junie Moon starring Liza Minnelli. The band then split up. A final album using the name\, Pacific Gas & Electric Starring Charlie Allen\, was recorded by Allen with studio musicians and released on the Dunhill label in 1973.[1][2] For a time the group also included Rick Durrett formerly of the band The Coven on keyboards.[citation needed] Tom Marshall later suffered deteriorating health and personal circumstances\, being homeless since the 1980s.[4] Frank Petricca became a commodity broker.[5] Charlie Allen died in 1990\, aged 48.[6]  Past members Charlie Allen Tom Marshall (1967--70) Brent Block (1967--70) Glenn Schwartz (1967--70) Frank Cook (1967--70) Ron Woods (1970--72) Frank Petricca (1970--72) Ken Utterback (1970--72) Jerry Aiello (1971--72) Stanley Abernathy (1971--72) Alfred Galagos (1971--72) Virgil Gonsalves (1971--72) Joe Lala (1971--72) COL channel name VAL ozzyserbia	1

Erskine Butterfield formed his piano-show case band in 1938 and slowly built a reputation on the East Coast. During their tour of the mid West\, the band signed on for radio staff work before gaining the attention of Decca Records.  Erskine was a good jazz pianist\, in later years Decca discovered his unique singing abilities\, and recorded additional songs highlighting those talents. The Decca songs that featured his singing include\, "Salt Butter\," "Missouri Waltz\," and "Blackberry Jam." His bands light swing and traditional piano phrases lead to a few standard band hits that occasional appear on movie soundtracks\, such as\, "Lovin' Man\," and "Because Of You."  During the 1950's he remained active in the studio with a number of album releases as well as TV appearances on The Nat King Cole Show\, The Tony Martin Program and The Jo Stafford Show.

COL description VAL (Written by Fred Rose) Recorded 16 May 1951 [no 2170]  Capitol Recording Studio\, 5515 Melrose Ave.\, Hollywood\, CA – Boots Faye and Idaho Call (+ Speedy West [steel]\, Harold Hensley [fiddle] + more unknown musicians   Born Grace Eloise Tartsch in Springfield MISSOURI (1923 - 1999)... An early 1950s article tells us that though she was the youngest in the family of singers\, she was the first to make it a profession. Life found them in Springfield\, Missouri when she decided to form a duet team with a friend (Mary Genevie Brayfield "Bobby Faye") and called themselves the Faye Sisters and earned a spot on the staff of KWTO in Springfield. While at KWTO\, Boots was also a part of a female group that KWTO billed as the Hillbilly Belles...Boots and Idaho were also doing some songwriting. The 1950s article mentions that Boots had written such tunes as "Cry\, Cry\, Cry" and "Leave It To Jesus." Later on\, she and Idaho co-wrote such tunes as "Baby Sitter Blues" and "Crying My Heart With the Blues."   On the personal side\, Boots was married to Idaho in 1945. He passed away in 1993. They were the parents of four children. COL channel name VAL mrblindfreddy9999	0

COL title VAL I Heard It Through the Grapevine COL performer VAL The Undisputed Truth	COL video title VAL ABBEY LINCOLN little Niles (1958) COL description VAL Album : it's magic Tune written by Jon Hendricks / Randy Weston  Because Abbey Lincoln has always been careful to sing songs that have a deep meaning for her\, all of her recordings through the years are memorable in their own way; there are no duds in her discography. Her second Riverside session (and her third recording)\, It's Magic has been reissued on this CD in the Original Jazz Classics series. The backup musicians are among the best in jazz at the time (Kenny Dorham or Art Farmer on trumpet\, trombonist Curtis Fuller\, Benny Golson on tenor\, Jerome Richardson or Sahib Shihab on reeds\, pianist Wynton Kelly\, Paul Chambers or Sam Jones on bass\, and drummer Philly Joe Jones) and they have opportunities to play short solos. Lincoln is heard at her early best on such numbers as "I Am in Love\," "An Occasional Man\," "Out of the Past" and Randy Weston's "Little Niles." Recommended. COL channel name VAL OubaelPhoumet	0

COL title VAL Summertime (Guajira) COL performer VAL Ray Barretto	COL video title VAL Toy Factory - Summertime (1970) COL description VAL Banda: Toy Factory Album: ST (1970) Origem: Estados Unidos Gravadora: AVCO Embassy - AVLP 7014   Though we haven't been able to track down much bibliographical information on this late-60s bi-racial outfit\, we think they were from Long Island\, New York. From the liner notes on their LP we can also tell you Greg Weiss was the lead singer and was responsible for writing roughly half the material. The rest of the line up consisted of bassist Bill\, guitarist Billy\, drummer Joey and keyboard player Sal (great detail there). Produced by Bernie Lawrence\, the majority of 1970's "Toy Factory" found the band trying to fight their way through rather faceless MOR pop. Lead singer Greg Weiss had a decent voice\, but on tracks such as "What Is Youth"\, "To Live or Die" and "Honey\, Forever" he employed an irritating faux-English accent that recalled Davy Jones (he sounds like David Hemmings to me Bad Cat!!!). He also had an irritating habit of throwing mock sobs and groans into the mix ("When I'm with You" and "Honey Forever"). Strike three were the occasional French lyrics (don't pick on the French Bad Cat!!!) he tossed into the mix ("To Live or Die" and "Honey Forever"). Curiously\, the band was at their best when they cut loose and go for a harder rock sound. In this case\, the pseudo-psychedelic "No Rhyme To Orange" (sporting a nice fuzz guitar solo) and "Things" was a nifty slice of blue-eyed soul. "Summertime" also found the band turning in one of the weirdest George Gershwin covers we've ever heard (pretty decent guitar here too Bad Cat!!!). This one certainly won't change your life\, but it's one of those period failures that's worth checking out. (Tyme Machine Blog) COL channel name VAL Melomano Discos	1

COL title VAL You've Lost That Loving Feeling COL performer VAL Shawn Klush	COL video title VAL Delaney and Bonnie - "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'" (Genesis LP) COL description VAL by Delaney & Bonnie. From the "Genesis" LP  For an album that is clearly a compilation of older material meant to capitalize on the fame from Delaney & Bonnie's 1971 hits on Atco\, The "Genesis" LP is a true find! There are only three tracks from the duo\, all produced by Leon Russell; the nine other titles are Delaney Bramlett solo\, six produced by Jackie DeShannon\, three others with no producer credited. Despite the slight deception -- that this is a Delaney Bramlett album with three bonus tracks by the hit group -- the disc still works on its own. DeShannon has Delaney sounding like Gene Pitney on "Tomorrow Never Comes\," while "Heartbreak Hotel" and Ray Charles' "I Got a Woman" have him emulating Elvis. On the uncredited production of "Lonely Me\," Mr. Bramlett goes for an early John Lennon vocal style\, then veers off to Gerry and the Pacemakers territory on his originals\, "Without Your Love" and "Better Man Than Me\," quite revealing in that they are so different from the music Jimmy Miller produced for the group when Delaney & Bonnie on Tour With Eric Clapton emerged. Jackie DeShannon's pop production kicks in again with "Liverpool Lou\," and it is back to that Gene Pitney sound. COL channel name VAL BobSeger1981	1

(Jane Brace) Observer  "...Forcione seamlessly interweaves African\, blues\, Brazilian\, classical\, flamenco and Indian influences into an entirely personal signature sound. Evocative\, sensuos\, meticulously wrought\, this is music-making with a singular vision.'   ( Peter Queen) ****Jazz Wise (Apr 07)   '...Guitar heroics\, yes\, but with a touch of class.' (Clive Davis) The Times (Dec 06)  '...Recommended unreservedly.'

(Gareth K Vile) www.stv.tv (06)  - "A performer of world class status ... forceful and with an enviable technique\, he takes the guitar to new levels of expression combining its melodic powers with dramatic percussive effects. Forcione boldly goes where no guitarist has gone before and the results are quite spectacular ... miss him at your peril". THE STAGE     - "Forcione plays unstringed parts of the guitar other players can't hope to reach" THE INDEPENDENT    - "Forcione belongs to the absolute world top" www.hi-fi.nl    - "AF is a musician's musician in the best sense\,with superlative tecnique that is fluent\,natural and truly virtuoso without being flashy."

COL title VAL Pepe COL performer VAL Al Caiola Guitars with Orchestra	COL video title VAL ♥ "The Way of Love" - by Kathy Kirby COL description VAL UPDATE: May 20\, 2011 -- It's in the news that this lovely artist joined her Creator today.  Peace be unto her..... - Originally uploaded in my previous channel (65Reasons) on June 16\, 2008. It is being re-uploaded with some updates... - "The Way of Love" Composer: Jacques Dieval English Lyrics: Al Stillman   The lyricist for the French version "J'ai le mal de toi" is Michel Rivegauche.  The song was originally written in French under the name 'J'ai le mal de toi' and recorded by Lili Castel for the song competition "Musik Ohne Grenzen" on the Belgian radio (BRT).   The French lyrics were written by Michel Rivgauche.   In 1965\, it was released as a single by Kathy Kirby in English. Curiously\, while this single failed to chart in her native United Kingdom\, where Kirby placed several singles on the charts in the mid-60's\, it became her only song to place on Billboard Hot 100. The song's lyrics were penned from a male point of view. Kirby's rendition does not change the perspective\, creating a story in which the subject to whom she sings has left her for a male.  "The Way of Love" was later recorded by Cher. Her version hit number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 in February 1972.   - Enjoy! - COL channel name VAL 65Seasons	0

I don't think anyone ever will.  Her technique is Driving\, Precise\, Crisp\, Powerful\, Percussive\, Rhythmic and completely her own. What she does all by hereself with an acoustic guitar and a slide sometimes almost defies belief.    This is just an Excellent cover of Higher Ground--one that I think might just have inspired the Red Hot Chili Peppers--although I'll take Ellen's version.  I'll take it over Stevie's as well.  Ellen was born in the USA\, spend many years in Japan as her parents were missionaries and has now lives in Calgary.   She's been living in Canada for many decades now.

COL title VAL Early in the Morning COL performer VAL Buddy Guy	COL video title VAL GRANT LEE PHILLIPS love my way (2006) COL description VAL The Psycheledic Furs' cover  album ; Nineteeneighties   However\, rather than going for a spunky\, electric sound here that might match the style of the originals\, Phillips' arrangements are measured and atmospheric\, dominated by acoustic instruments and a gentle approach that blends nicely with the smooth\, bittersweet flow of his vocals. While this isn't the way you remember hearing these songs back in the day\, Phillips reaches into the material with an obvious love and respect\, and he finds a beautifully melancholy essence in these tunes that makes for a satisfying marriage of artist and material.

Through The Royal Scots Greys\, whose predecessors were raised by King Charles II in 1678\, the regiment can claim to be the oldest surviving Cavalry of the Line in The British Army. The Pipes and Drums of the current regiment have their origin in the small pipe band that came to the Royal Scots Greys in 1946. They have performed around the world and released many successful albums\, while also undertaking military assignments in service to the Queen. All members of The Pipes and Drums are fully trained tank-crew members. They were deployed as part of the 7th Armored Brigade during the Gulf War. COL channel name VAL Steve Thrasher	0
COL title VAL You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin' COL performer VAL The Firm	COL video title VAL Delaney and Bonnie - "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'" (Genesis LP) COL description VAL by Delaney & Bonnie. From the "Genesis" LP  For an album that is clearly a compilation of older material meant to capitalize on the fame from Delaney & Bonnie's 1971 hits on Atco\, The "Genesis" LP is a true find! There are only three tracks from the duo\, all produced by Leon Russell; the nine other titles are Delaney Bramlett solo\, six produced by Jackie DeShannon\, three others with no producer credited. Despite the slight deception -- that this is a Delaney Bramlett album with three bonus tracks by the hit group -- the disc still works on its own. DeShannon has Delaney sounding like Gene Pitney on "Tomorrow Never Comes\," while "Heartbreak Hotel" and Ray Charles' "I Got a Woman" have him emulating Elvis. On the uncredited production of "Lonely Me\," Mr. Bramlett goes for an early John Lennon vocal style\, then veers off to Gerry and the Pacemakers territory on his originals\, "Without Your Love" and "Better Man Than Me\," quite revealing in that they are so different from the music Jimmy Miller produced for the group when Delaney & Bonnie on Tour With Eric Clapton emerged. Jackie DeShannon's pop production kicks in again with "Liverpool Lou\," and it is back to that Gene Pitney sound. COL channel name VAL BobSeger1981	1

COL title VAL Mr. Anthony's Boogie and One O'Clock Jump COL performer VAL The New Ray Anthony Show	COL video title VAL Victor Fields ft Gerald Albright - And I Love Her COL description VAL June 1\, 2002 " 52nd Street " Album http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/victor https://www.amazon.com/52nd-Street-Victor-Fields/dp/B00006B0UN  The select listener of jazz vocals will find Victor Fields engaging\, charming\, and irresistibly appealing. On the critically acclaimed 52nd Street\, Fields convincingly demonstrates an unforgettable tableau of 11 wonderful songs from the jazz\, pop\, blues\, and Brazilian jazz genres in which the listener can delight. Accompanied by an array of jazz stars\, including Jeff Lorber\, this is simply a superb recording due to Fields' flawless vocals\, poetic imagination\, and soulful phrasings on such songs as "Maria\," "And I Love Her" featuring Gerald Albright\, the smooth jazz rendition of "A Night in Tunisia" featuring Chris Botti\, and "Open Your Heart" featuring the Oakland Interfaith Youth Gospel Choir. Victor Fields has marvelously timed his lyrics to compliment the breathtaking manner of saxophonist Albright and trumpeter Botti with his masterful tenor range and tells two exceptionally well-told musical stories that are filled with colorful nuance\, imaginative shadings\, and sensual scattings. Fields and Claudia Villela brilliantly transform Toots Thielemans' "Bluesette" into a Brazilian samba that is both lyrical and buoyant. With 52nd Street\, Victor Fields' sensuous\, sexy\, but sunny vocals have put many jazz vocalists in the shade. Top pick: "Five-Two Blues" featuring John R. Burr. COL channel name VAL dc grooves	0

BIOGRAFIA (da Wikipedia): Entra all'EIAR vincendo il secondo concorso per voci nuove Gara nazionale per gli artisti della canzone\, indetto dall'ente radiofonico nel 1939\, esordendo nel 1940 insieme a Silvana Fioresi nell'orchestra Angelini e proseguendo poi in quelle di Pippo Barzizza\, Carlo Zeme e Beppe Mojetta. Allo stesso periodo risalgono le prime incisioni\, realizzate per la Cetra; nel 1947 incide le canzoni Abbasso le donne e La luna e sei soldi\, tratte dalle colonne sonore dei rispettivi omonimi film. Dotato di una voce baritonale lievemente rauca\, canta anche in orchestre di jazz\, esibendosi spesso con il noto chitarrista Michele Ortuso; il successo continua per tutto il decennio\, finché\, nel 1952 si trasferisce in Sudamerica a seguito di un ingaggio cinematografico; lì continua l'attività sino al periodo a cavallo tra gli anni settanta ed ottanta\, quando\, dopo essersi esibito ancora con successo per lungo tempo nei ritrovi più prestigiosi del Venezuela\, si ritira a Caracas. Nel 2006 il regista Pasquale Pozzessere ha inserito\, nella colonna sonora della miniserie televisiva La provinciale\, la canzone La ragazza del ritmo\, della quale Donà\, oltre che interprete\, è stato anche autore del testo e della musica. Tra i suoi motivi più famosi\, si ricordano: Venezia\, la luna e tu\, Buonanotte Brasil\, Bocca nel buio\, La danza dello scoiattolo\, Il tamburo della banda d'Affori (una delle sue canzoni più note\, scritta da Mario Panzeri)\, Serenata ad un angelo\, Ballerina\, Botta e risposta\, Suona balalaika e Tarantella d'amore.

COL title VAL Can't Feel My Face COL performer VAL Jason Chen	COL video title VAL Bonnie Dobson - A taste of honey COL description VAL from the album 'Good Morning Rain' in 1970   By the time she moved permanently to London in 1970\, Canadian Bonnie Dobson had a pretty susbtantial career under her belt: four albums on the Prestige label including the song for which shes best known (Walk me out in the) Morning Dew plus two on RCA Victor.  Born in Toronto in 1940\, she got into folk seriously as a teenager on summer camps where people like Pete Seeger and Leon Bibb would turn up to give concerts. She got her break in 1960\, left university and started touring in the States.  I did my first tour with Brownie McGee and Sonny Terry who had been my idols and then I was playing with them\, she recalled in 1993. And then I went off to Los Angeles. There was a festival up in Idlewild\, the University of California had this arts festival every summer and I taught Canadian folk songs. I never got back to University. I just kept going and eventually I hit New York.  Grief over theft What followed were those six albums\, years of touring and lots of grief over her song Morning Dew being stolen by Tim Rose. In November 1969 she made her London debut at the Queen Elizabeth Hall\, and settled in the city the following year.   Lost Ladies of Folk She recorded just this one album for Argo\, then one for Polydor in 1976 (Morning Dew)\, followed by a few singles in the early eighties. Since then its been pretty much reissues\, retrospectives and compilations.  She had in fact called it quits I didnt feel I was growing\, I didnt feel I was doing anything. I just seemed to be doing the same things over and over again and I thought some people are happy to do that\, I wasnt. So I thought Ill go back and get my degree. Once back in the university world\, she stayed\, working as an administrator in the Philosophy Department of Birkbeck College\, London.  In 2007\, 28 years after she made her UK debut there\, she was persuaded back on to the stage at Queen Elizabeth Hall by Jarvis Cocker\, who was running a Lost Ladies of Folk night as part of his Meltdown curatorship. By all accounts she was on fine form. COL channel name VAL andrijadragon	0

COL title VAL 'Til I Gain Control Again COL performer VAL Albert Lee	COL video title VAL Sarah Vaughan with Clifford Brown - September Song (EmArcy Records 1954) COL description VAL "September Song" is an American pop standard composed by Kurt Weill\, with lyric by Maxwell Anderson\, introduced by Walter Huston in the 1938 Broadway musical Knickerbocker Holiday. It has since been recorded by numerous singers and instrumentalists. It was also used in the 1950 film September Affair\, and for the credits in the television series May to December (a quote from the opening line of the song).  Although the song was written as an old man's lament for the passing of his youth\, some of the most famous versions have been recorded by women artists. Thus Sarah Vaughan's version of 1955\, and Ella Fitzgerald's with pianist Paul Smith on the 1960 Verve release Ella Fitzgerald Sings Songs From Let No Man Write My Epitaph are both regarded as Jazz classics. Eartha Kitt and Weill's wife Lotte Lenya both recorded the song in 1957\, and Jo Stafford\, Patti Page as well as Anne Shelton also recorded versions during the 1950s. In 1958 Eydie Gormé included the song in her album\, Love is the season and in 1989 both Lena Horne in The Men in My Life\, and Julie Wilson in an album of Kurt Weill songs.  Personally this song reminds me of waking up in on an early Saturday morning just as the sun starts to pierce through the window shade slits and the flowers outside with morning dew start to open up. As one eye slightly opens up and then the other followed by a fisted hand arm stretch and yawn... then Sarah starts to sing this song... oh so beautifully!  Sarah's accompanied by Leader/Arranger: Ernie Wilkins\, Clifford Brown (trumpet)\, Herbie Mann (flute)\, Paul Quinichette (tenor)\, Jimmy Jones (piano)\, Joe Benjamin (bass)\, and Roy Haynes (drums). Recorded in New York\, December 18\, 1954. (EmArcy Records)  For it's a long\, long while from May to December\, But the days grow short when you reach September.  And the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame One hasn't got time for the waiting game.  And the days dwindle down to a precious few September\, November  And these few precious days I'll spend with you. These golden days I'll spend With you  And these few precious days I'll spend with you. Not January\, February\, June or July....  September COL channel name VAL RoundMidnightTV	0

COL title VAL What'd I Say COL performer VAL Nancy Sinatra	COL video title VAL Brenda Lee - What'd I Say (1964) - with Jimmy Page COL description VAL #BrendaLeeRocks Our channel tradition is "videos only"\, but we make an exception for this audio track. In 1964\, Brenda Lee was in London at the invitation of the Queen of England. She sang "All the Way" at the Royal Variety Performance show. In search of an updated sound\, she also met with Mickie Most who was the hot producer at the time. They chose "Is It True?" as the A-side of a single and Brenda picked "What'd I Say" as the B-side. She wanted to be the first female to cover Ray Charles controversial 1959 hit. "Is It True?" was top twenty on both sides of the Atlantic and earned a Gold Record. "What'd I Say" was a minor hit in some countries. Meanwhile\, in the United States\, the marketing geniuses at the evil record company decided to replace "What'd I Say" with "Just Behind The Rainbow" for the US release. Apparently\, Brenda Lee was Little Miss Adult Contemporary to them and nothing so raw as this track could be allowed. As a result\, "What'd I Say" was never released in the States.  Track Info Recorded at the Decca #2 Studios at 165 Broadhurst Gardens\, West Hampstead\, North London on 17 August 1964 and the demos went out to the radio stations the very next day on 18 Aug 1964. Brenda made 11 promotional appearances for the single.  "Is It True?" entered British charts the week of 9/16/64.  Personnel: Arthur Greenslade (1923 –2003) (piano)\, Jimmy Page(1944-  ) later of Led Zeppelin (guitar)\, Big Jim Sullivan (1941 - 2012)  (guitar); Bobby Graham (1940 -- 2009) (drums)\, Alan Weighell (1922 –2002) (bass)\, Stan Barrett (percussion); Terry Johnson (sound engineer)\, Reg Guest (1930- arranger)\, Mickie Most (born Michael Hayes 1938 -- 2003) (producer).  Bobby Graham recalled the session: "Some acts stood out\, either because they put so much into the recordings. ....... Brenda Lee really did perform. Mickie Most produced that record ('Is It True') at Decca\, they wanted this English sound. John Carter and Kenny Lewis wrote the song\, and also did backing vocals. Jimmy Page and Jim Sullivan were on guitar\, Alan Weighell was on bass\, Stan Barrett on percussion and myself on drums.The arranger was Reg Guest. For the B side\, 'What I'd Say'. we were messing around\, somebody started the lick\, Brenda jumped in and Mickie Most said 'let's record that'. It was done in one take". Note: Graham is mistaken about 'What I'd Say' being a spur of the moment decision. Brenda herself says she wanted to do it and I can't imagine they would go into the session without a "B" side.   Availability UK Import album - Ace CHCHD-1222 "The Queen Of Rock 'N' Roll"  Released 2009  German Import album - Bear Family BFB10025 "Brenda Lee Rocks" Released June 14\, 2011  A session anecdote: Mickie Most recalled that Brenda Lee was late getting to the studio. It turned out that the car sent to pick her up had broken down. Mickie worried that time was short for the usual amount of takes. His fears were allayed when Brenda arrived and ran through "Is It True?". Most told the NME reporter "it sounded like she had been singing it all her life!".  At three years old\, Brenda Mae Tarpley needed to hear a song only once or twice in order to sing it back in perfect pitch and rhythm. This is according to her mother and older sister. Of course\, the Nashville session players had grown used to this extraordinary facility and it was common for them to lay down four to six tracks in one 3 Hr session. When she recorded outside of Nashville\, producers were always amazed at how few tries were needed for a Brenda Lee recording.  SG Barnard recollection:  I was lucky enough to be in the recording studio when Mickie Most produced this song for her. Jimmy Page's guitar sounds good as ever. Mickie insisted that the whole company joined in the choruses for 'What'd I Say'. Such amazing times! RIP Mickie\, industry genius.  NB: SG Barnard was Brenda's Press Officer in the UK. She posted on another YouTube video: "She [Brenda] was the most professional act I ever worked with".   Songwriter: Ray Charles  Alright\, hey hey\, what'd I say\, what'd I say Well\, see the girl with the red dress on\, She can do the boogie all night long All right\, hey\, hey All right\, hear me what'd I say.

COL title VAL Summertime COL performer VAL Miles Davis	COL video title VAL Toy Factory - Summertime (1970) COL description VAL Banda: Toy Factory Album: ST (1970) Origem: Estados Unidos Gravadora: AVCO Embassy - AVLP 7014   Though we haven't been able to track down much bibliographical information on this late-60s bi-racial outfit\, we think they were from Long Island\, New York. From the liner notes on their LP we can also tell you Greg Weiss was the lead singer and was responsible for writing roughly half the material. The rest of the line up consisted of bassist Bill\, guitarist Billy\, drummer Joey and keyboard player Sal (great detail there). Produced by Bernie Lawrence\, the majority of 1970's "Toy Factory" found the band trying to fight their way through rather faceless MOR pop. Lead singer Greg Weiss had a decent voice\, but on tracks such as "What Is Youth"\, "To Live or Die" and "Honey\, Forever" he employed an irritating faux-English accent that recalled Davy Jones (he sounds like David Hemmings to me Bad Cat!!!). He also had an irritating habit of throwing mock sobs and groans into the mix ("When I'm with You" and "Honey Forever"). Strike three were the occasional French lyrics (don't pick on the French Bad Cat!!!) he tossed into the mix ("To Live or Die" and "Honey Forever"). Curiously\, the band was at their best when they cut loose and go for a harder rock sound. In this case\, the pseudo-psychedelic "No Rhyme To Orange" (sporting a nice fuzz guitar solo) and "Things" was a nifty slice of blue-eyed soul. "Summertime" also found the band turning in one of the weirdest George Gershwin covers we've ever heard (pretty decent guitar here too Bad Cat!!!). This one certainly won't change your life\, but it's one of those period failures that's worth checking out. (Tyme Machine Blog) COL channel name VAL Melomano Discos	1

BIOGRAFIA (da Wikipedia): Entra all'EIAR vincendo il secondo concorso per voci nuove Gara nazionale per gli artisti della canzone\, indetto dall'ente radiofonico nel 1939\, esordendo nel 1940 insieme a Silvana Fioresi nell'orchestra Angelini e proseguendo poi in quelle di Pippo Barzizza\, Carlo Zeme e Beppe Mojetta. Allo stesso periodo risalgono le prime incisioni\, realizzate per la Cetra; nel 1947 incide le canzoni Abbasso le donne e La luna e sei soldi\, tratte dalle colonne sonore dei rispettivi omonimi film. Dotato di una voce baritonale lievemente rauca\, canta anche in orchestre di jazz\, esibendosi spesso con il noto chitarrista Michele Ortuso; il successo continua per tutto il decennio\, finché\, nel 1952 si trasferisce in Sudamerica a seguito di un ingaggio cinematografico; lì continua l'attività sino al periodo a cavallo tra gli anni settanta ed ottanta\, quando\, dopo essersi esibito ancora con successo per lungo tempo nei ritrovi più prestigiosi del Venezuela\, si ritira a Caracas. Nel 2006 il regista Pasquale Pozzessere ha inserito\, nella colonna sonora della miniserie televisiva La provinciale\, la canzone La ragazza del ritmo\, della quale Donà\, oltre che interprete\, è stato anche autore del testo e della musica. Tra i suoi motivi più famosi\, si ricordano: Venezia\, la luna e tu\, Buonanotte Brasil\, Bocca nel buio\, La danza dello scoiattolo\, Il tamburo della banda d'Affori (una delle sue canzoni più note\, scritta da Mario Panzeri)\, Serenata ad un angelo\, Ballerina\, Botta e risposta\, Suona balalaika e Tarantella d'amore.

He did splendidly for a while\, and the production values he learned playing in rock-inflected settings show clearly on his first kids recording. By the Light of the Moon is most surely a country recording\, but it has all the driving rhythmic energy of an elegantly mastered rock album. The drums sound fat and still crisp\, the guitars bright. Daniels's voice\, especially during the interludes where he speaks about the music\, reveals a timeworn huskiness that will charm kids looking for a cowboy to sing to them. The songs emphasize the old\, with "John Henry" and "I'm an Old Cowhand" standing out. The latter includes Daniels playing short fiddle solos that cut a nice\, fresh path through the tune. A sonically splashy session indeed\, By the Light of the Moon has enough old-timey vibrance to merit a spot in any roots-oriented kids collection.  Song Title    1. Get Along\, Little Dogies 3:26  2.

The digital-only EP for Anti- Records\, available exclusively through iTunes starting June 16\, revisits BETTYE's forgotten post-Atlantic Records years as a nightclub singer\, Broadway performer\, and touring cast member opposite Cab Calloway in "Bubbling Brown Sugar."    The EP opens with a stirring solo version of Sam Cooke's posthumous Civil Rights anthem "A Change Is Gonna Come\," a song which BETTYE sang with Jon Bon Jovi in January as part of the "We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial" concert. Joining BETTYE for these Sessions are pianist and musical director Al Hill\, veteran bassist John Heard -- who has accompanied such luminaries as Count Basie\, Cole Porter\, Ella Fitzgerald\, and Art Pepper -- drummer Danny Frankel (k.d. lang\, Lou Reed)\, and Tom Hagerman from DeVotchKa on strings.    A mix of standards and soul classics from BETTYE's 1970s stage and nightclub repertoire rounds out the 6-song set\, including songs by Thelonious Monk\, Duke Ellington\, Bill Withers\, and Jimmy Reed. A rendition of Billie Holiday's "God Bless The Child" -- a song that BETTYE first performed with show-stopping magnificence in "Bubbling Brown Sugar" -- highlights BETTYE's vocal mastery. Rather than attack\, BETTYE approaches these tracks with subtlety -- while nonetheless wresting every ounce and every nuance of meaning from the words she sings. Once more\, BETTYE provides the definitive answer to the question posed by NPR in its review of The Scene of the Crime: "Is there any soul singer who brings more guts\, more conviction and more emotion to her singing?" Absolutely not. COL channel name VAL imnokid	1

Their use of vocalese melded well with the song's swaying\, ballad-like melody.    Volare (to fly)\, or "Nel blu\, dipinto di blu" (In the blue\, painted blue)\, was originally recorded by Italian singer-songwriter Domenico Modugno. It was written by Franco Migliacci and Modugno and was released as a single February 1st\, 1958.  Since then\, the song has been covered and recorded by over 100 artists\, most notably by Dean Martin\, whose version reached the number two spot on the UK Singles Chart\, and peaked at fifteen on the Billboard Top 100.

COL title VAL My Shoes Keep Walking Back to You COL performer VAL Daniel O'Donnell	COL video title VAL David Bromberg - Dehlia (Live) with Lyrics COL description VAL Bromberg's site: http://www.davidbromberg.net/ for his cd's\, tour dates\, & info.  The perfect blues song. A slow sad ballad which tells a story. You have to listen. Harp comes in at 3:48 and adds an even sadder note to the song. Gorgeous music. Lyrics by Blind Willie McTell and a story told so well by David Bromberg on his first album\, "David Bromberg" released in 1972. The haunting harp and story David tells adds to this perfect mix. I know you will enjoy!  Lyrics modified between the two versions. David sings most of them\, but perhaps in a different order:  Delia was a gambling girl\, she gambled all around. Yes\, she was a gambling girl\, she would lay her money down. She's all I've got\, is gone.  Delia's dear old mother\, she took a trip out West. When she returned\, little Delia had gone to rest. She's all I've got\, is gone.  Delia's mama weeped. Delia's daddy mourned. It wouldn't have been so bad\, good people\, if the poor girl had died at home. She's all I've got\, is gone.  Curtis is looking high\, and Curtis looking low. He shot poor Delia down\, good people\, with a big bore forty four. She's all I've got.  High up on the house tops\, as high as I could see\, Looking for those rounders\, who were looking out for me. She's all I've got.  Now you can call out your rubber tired taxis and your double seated hacks\,  They took poor Dehlia to the graveyard\, well they failed to bring her back. She's all I got\, is gone.  Judge he said to Curtis\, what's this noise about? It's all about them rounders\, they're trying to cut me out. She's all I've got\, is gone.  Curtis said to the judge\, what may be my fine? The judge says "Poor boy\, you've got ninety nine." She's all I've got\, is gone.  Curtis is in the jailhouse\, drinking from an old tin cup. Delia's in the graveyard boy\, she may not never get up. She's all I've got. is gone.  COMMENTARY BY DAVID BROMBERG ABOUT THIS IS PROBABLY A JAIL HOUSE SONG BEING SUNG BY CURTIS. HE MENTIONS HE LEARNED THIS IS THE BLIND WILLIE MCTELL VERSION.  Delia\, Delia\, how could it be? You loved all those rounders\, you never really did love me. She's all I've got.  Delia\, Delia\, how could it be? You loved those rounders\, but you never really did love me. She's all I've got\, is gone.  There are at least TWO versions of this song. Lyrics written by Blind Willie for one version and by Rev. Gary Davis for the second version. Johnny Cash sang Delia's Gone by Davis (the second version). I checked out some info and there was a Dehlia killed by a "Curtis" in 1901\, but the girl was only 14 and she got into a fight with her young boyfriend. He shot her. If it is the same Dehlia\, a lot of poetic license was taken. The other facts all fit...paragraphs and paragraphs of facts. COL channel name VAL MyMoppet52	0

COL title VAL Four Walls COL performer VAL Dillard & Clark	COL video title VAL Maggie Bell - Wishing Well COL description VAL Suicide Sal - 1975  The success of Angel Air's series of Maggie Bell reissues can be easily judged by the Scottish singer's return to the U.K. after residing for years abroad\, a planned autobiography\, and her intention of touring. Although critically feted in the U.K.\, Bell\, both solo and with her former band Stone the Crows\, never quite achieved the commercial breakthrough everyone had so expected. Always a bridesmaid\, never a bride\, Bell's recording career was punctuated by a sole Stone the Crows charting album. With that band's demise in 1973\, the soul singer went solo\, releasing the (again) critically acclaimed Queen of the Night album\, with 1975's Suicide Sal following. A tougher\, more energized set than its predecessor\, Sal's electrifying live feel reflects the incendiary stage shows Bell and her new backing band had been playing in the intervening time between recordings. The two bonus tracks\, recorded at a gig later that year\, capture their live ferocity. Intriguingly\, the funky\, fiery title track\, an homage to Bell's Aunt\, a music hall star\, is one of only two originals on this set. The second\, the lavishly bluesy "If You Don't Know" was penned by band keyboardist Pete Wingfield\, and boasts a guesting Jimmy Page on guitar. The storming "Coming on Strong" also has a Bell connection\, being co-penned by ex-Crow Colin Allen and Zoot Money. The rest of the album comprises astutely chosen covers drawn from an eclectic selection of artists. One of the standouts is "It's Been So Long\," a powerful gospel number written by the Pretty Things' Phil May\, who not only rewrote some of the lyrics for Bell\, but added his backing vocals to the song. Free's classic "Wishing Well" gets a sensational workout\, while that band's offshoot Kossoff\, Kirke\, Tetsu & Rabbit's "Hold On" is taken to new emotive heights. From barrelling Beatles pop to the Sutherland Brothers poignant Gaelic ode\, from ballads to hefty rock & roll\, Bell struts across this set with style and such assurance\, that even Aunt Sal must have been impressed. One of Britain's greatest soul singers\, showcased at her best\, this magnificent album also includes an excellent\, expansive biography of this crucial artist.

Their innovative brass sound introduced British youth to soul music. Within three months of Epstein's management\, the band had their first UK hit single with "One Way Love" and a tour of Germany with The Beatles. They were the first British band to be signed to the Motown label.   Cliff crowned his success with the Rebel Rousers in 1966 with a song written exclusively for him by Lennon & McCartney - "Got To Get You Into My Life" which reached No. 3 in the UK charts\, creating a unique British soul sound. Their other hits include: "Back In the USSR"\, "One Way Love" and "I'll Take You Home"   On June 24\, 1966 Bennett & the Rebel Rousers opened up for the Beatles at the Circus Krone-Bau concert in Munich\, Germany.  In this clip the band does "C C Rider."  BTW ... The Rebel Rousers are using the drums from the Rattles\, another group playing at that show.

While still in his mid teens\, in the early 1960s\, he performed in Greenwich Village and\, following a chance meeting with Bob Dylan\, was encouraged to pursue a solo music career in upstate New York. He attended Bard College in New York\, and with his older brother John formed a band\, the Ginger Men. By 1967\, they had both signed with Verve Records\, for whom they then recorded an experimental concept album\, Playback\, issued in the name of the Appletree Theatre.  After John Boylan moved to California\, Terence stayed in New York\, returned to college\, and played with classmates Walter Becker and Donald Fagen. With them\, he cut a solo LP\, Alias Boona in 1969\, the title referring to his nickname. He then moved to California\, working again with his brother. After a few years he was signed to Asylum Records\, and recorded his self-titled second album in 1977. Like his previous record\, this was well received by critics but was never more than a cult success. However\, Boylan did enjoy some success as a songwriter when Iain Matthews turned his song "Shake It" into a top five hit.  01. Subterranean Homesick Blues 02. Don't Blame It On Your Wife 03.

COL title VAL Dust in the Wind COL performer VAL Dana Winner	COL video title VAL The Beatles - I'm Looking Through You COL description VAL The Beatles - I'm Looking Through You 1965  "I'm Looking Through You" is a Lennon/McCartney song\, written mainly by Paul McCartney\, that first appeared on The Beatles' 1965 album Rubber Soul.  It was written about Jane Asher\, McCartney's girlfriend of five years\, "You don't look different\, but you have changed\," the lyrics declare\, reflecting his dissatisfaction with their relationship.  The Beatles recorded three versions of the song in October and November 1965. The original version recorded on 24 October was slower than the released version\, had a significantly different rhythm\, and lacked the "Why\, tell me why..." middle eight of the final version.  It was eventually released in 1996 on the Anthology 2 compilation.  The final version was recorded on 10 November with overdubs on 11 November and is the version included on Rubber Soul.      * Paul McCartney -- double-tracked vocal\, acoustic rhythm guitar\, bass\, lead guitar     * John Lennon -- harmony vocal\, acoustic rhythm guitar     * George Harrison -- guitar     * Ringo Starr -- drums\, tambourine\, Hammond organ  In other news\, I have added the lyrics to this song so you can sing along\, or perhaps learn the song!

COL title VAL 'Round Midnight COL performer VAL Chaka Khan featuring The London Symphony Orchestra	COL video title VAL 'Round Midnight - Bettye LaVette COL description VAL This song is from an EP that was a digital-only release by Anti- Records. I have placed the song here to try to bring more attention to the release. It seems that many are unaware of it's existence. Support the artist and get the download from Itunes\, Amazon\, etc.  Bettye LaVette - vocals  Alan Hill - piano  John Heard: Bass  Danny Frankel: percussion  Tom Hagerman: strings & string arrangements   Produced & mixed by Rob Schnapf  Recorded at Sonara Recorders  Mastered by Mark Chalecki at Little Red Book Mastering   Song writing credits:  Change Is Gonna Come - Sam Cooke   Round Midnight - Thelonious Monk   God Bless The Child - Billie Holiday / Arthur Herzog   Lush Life - Billy Strayhorn   Ain't No Sunshine - Bill Withers   Ain't That Lovin' You - Jimmy Reed  Official Press Release  Having conquered the ghosts of a hard-luck past on her GRAMMY-nominated CD The Scene of the Crime\, BETTYE LAVETTE shines a new light on that past with her latest\, A CHANGE IS GONNA COME SESSIONS. The digital-only EP for Anti- Records\, available exclusively through iTunes starting June 16\, revisits BETTYE's forgotten post-Atlantic Records years as a nightclub singer\, Broadway performer\, and touring cast member opposite Cab Calloway in "Bubbling Brown Sugar."    The EP opens with a stirring solo version of Sam Cooke's posthumous Civil Rights anthem "A Change Is Gonna Come\," a song which BETTYE sang with Jon Bon Jovi in January as part of the "We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial" concert. Joining BETTYE for these Sessions are pianist and musical director Al Hill\, veteran bassist John Heard -- who has accompanied such luminaries as Count Basie\, Cole Porter\, Ella Fitzgerald\, and Art Pepper -- drummer Danny Frankel (k.d. lang\, Lou Reed)\, and Tom Hagerman from DeVotchKa on strings.    A mix of standards and soul classics from BETTYE's 1970s stage and nightclub repertoire rounds out the 6-song set\, including songs by Thelonious Monk\, Duke Ellington\, Bill Withers\, and Jimmy Reed. A rendition of Billie Holiday's "God Bless The Child" -- a song that BETTYE first performed with show-stopping magnificence in "Bubbling Brown Sugar" -- highlights BETTYE's vocal mastery. Rather than attack\, BETTYE approaches these tracks with subtlety -- while nonetheless wresting every ounce and every nuance of meaning from the words she sings. Once more\, BETTYE provides the definitive answer to the question posed by NPR in its review of The Scene of the Crime: "Is there any soul singer who brings more guts\, more conviction and more emotion to her singing?" Absolutely not. COL channel name VAL imnokid	1

Erskine Butterfield formed his piano-show case band in 1938 and slowly built a reputation on the East Coast. During their tour of the mid West\, the band signed on for radio staff work before gaining the attention of Decca Records.  Erskine was a good jazz pianist\, in later years Decca discovered his unique singing abilities\, and recorded additional songs highlighting those talents. The Decca songs that featured his singing include\, "Salt Butter\," "Missouri Waltz\," and "Blackberry Jam." His bands light swing and traditional piano phrases lead to a few standard band hits that occasional appear on movie soundtracks\, such as\, "Lovin' Man\," and "Because Of You."  During the 1950's he remained active in the studio with a number of album releases as well as TV appearances on The Nat King Cole Show\, The Tony Martin Program and The Jo Stafford Show.

COL title VAL Ring of Fire COL performer VAL Lucy Kaplansky	COL video title VAL Tina Turner - Help (Music Video - 2010 Re-Master) COL description VAL Artist: Tina Turner Song: Help Year: 1984  This rare music video for 'Help'\, a Beatles cover\, by Tina Turner has been remastered to the best of my ability considering where the footage came from. I own a copy of an old 'Now That's What I Call Music Video' VHS from the 1980s\, which I bought purely for this clip. As far as I am aware\, this is the only 'official' release of the video on VHS or DVD formatt. I have fixed the colour\, made the video a little sharper\, and I used the CD audio of the song to remaster the video's audio which was in mono and very muddy.  This video is a gem\, and as a huge Tina fan\, an excellent find. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I do. COL channel name VAL beyoncesmaw	0

COL title VAL Tornerai COL performer VAL Dino Di Luca e Coro	COL video title VAL Gunter Noris and His Orchestra -  Swanee COL description VAL It was George Gershwin's very first "hit" and his biggest selling song : "Swanee".  The critics of the 1920's described the song as "infectious" and that actually was (and still is) a quite accurate description of this captivating tune.  The name linked forever to the song is that of Al Jolson who made the song a worldwide success but some people may also remember Judy Garland's version which was more extravert and outspoken than Jolson's "classic" interpretation. Here Gunter Noris captures the song's infectiousness by adding a pleasant sounding beat while bearing in mind the sound of the "golden twenties" as well. From the Album "Plays Gershwin" here's Gunter Noris and His Orchestra taking you back in time with Gershwin's "Swanee".  Enjoy. COL channel name VAL Socratess2007	0

Thereafter\, he hosted numerous game and variety shows\, including The Steve Allen Show\, I've Got a Secret\, The New Steve Allen Show\, and was a regular panel member on CBS' What's My Line?  Allen was a "creditable" pianist\, and a prolific composer\, having penned over 14\,000 songs\, one of which was recorded by Perry Como and Margaret Whiting\, others by Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme\, Les Brown\, and Gloria Lynne.

COL title VAL Ain't That Peculiar COL performer VAL Jackson 5	COL video title VAL The Charlie Daniels Band - Old Chisholm Trail.wmv COL description VAL By the Light of the Moon - Campfire Songs (1997) In the 1970s\, fiddler Charlie Daniels was one of the few almost completely country-leaning artists to make a play on the mainstream rock market. He did splendidly for a while\, and the production values he learned playing in rock-inflected settings show clearly on his first kids recording. By the Light of the Moon is most surely a country recording\, but it has all the driving rhythmic energy of an elegantly mastered rock album. The drums sound fat and still crisp\, the guitars bright. Daniels's voice\, especially during the interludes where he speaks about the music\, reveals a timeworn huskiness that will charm kids looking for a cowboy to sing to them. The songs emphasize the old\, with "John Henry" and "I'm an Old Cowhand" standing out. The latter includes Daniels playing short fiddle solos that cut a nice\, fresh path through the tune. A sonically splashy session indeed\, By the Light of the Moon has enough old-timey vibrance to merit a spot in any roots-oriented kids collection.  Song Title    1. Get Along\, Little Dogies 3:26  2. Cowboy Logic 4:33  3. I'm an Old Cowhand (from the Rio Grande) 3:32  4. Old Chisholm Trail 4:47  5. Sixteen Tons 2:58  6. Back in the Saddle Again 3:11  7. John Henry 3:56  8. Top Hand 4:04  9.

L'auteur de L'écume des jours a su trouver les mots qui sonnent avec grâce. La direction musicale de Laurent De Wild est un "Voyage au Paradis".  Libération -- 2009 -- Bruno Pfeiffer -- Diane chante Vian tel que -- Un météore a explosé la surface tranquille de la lune : son dernier disque "Docteur Boris et Mister Vian". Le travail enduit de baume les oreilles\, puis le reste de la carcasse. C'est tout simplement extra... Un régal. Vian n'aurait sans doute pas hésité à applaudir « Rue de la flemme ». Quel concentré de swing relâché! Quel modèle de grande chanson (tour de force de la traduction)! Pourquoi  citer seulement  le savoureux « Voyage au Paradis » ? Les onze valent le coup. Le disque passe comme un remède à l'imbécillité de la période actuelle... La profondeur légère de l'interprétation s'offre comme un cadeau. Les chorus de Laurent de Wilde\, huit ou seize mesures maxi\, ne goinfrent pas la mise en place. La complicité de l'ensemble se ressent du respect flagrant que se portent les artistes. Le prochain qui me classe Diane Tell dans la variété\, je l'enjoins : jazzons les idées préconçues.

COL title VAL Lay Down Sally COL performer VAL Marcella Detroit	COL video title VAL Erroll Garner Trio - I Only Have Eyes For You (Savoy Records 1949) COL description VAL "I Only Have Eyes for You" is a popular song by composer Harry Warren and lyricist Al Dubin\, written in 1934 for the film Dames where it was introduced by Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler.  Erroll Louis Garner (June 15\, 1921 -- January 2\, 1977) was an American jazz pianist and composer known for his swing playing and ballads. His best-known composition\, the ballad "Misty"\, has become a jazz standard. Allmusic.com calls him "one of the most distinctive of all pianists" and a "brilliant virtuoso".  Born with his twin brother Ernest in Pittsburgh\, Pennsylvania\, to an African American family on June 15\, 1921\, Erroll began playing piano at the age of three. His elder siblings were taught piano by Miss Bowman. From an early age Erroll would sit down and play anything she'd demonstrated\, just like Miss Bowman\, his eldest sister Martha said. He attended George Westinghouse High School\, as did fellow pianists Billy Strayhorn and Ahmad Jamal. Garner was self-taught and remained an "ear player" all his life – he never learned to read music. At the age of seven\, he began appearing on the radio station KDKA in Pittsburgh with a group called the Candy Kids. By the age of 11\, he was playing on the Allegheny riverboats. At 14 in 1937\, he joined local saxophonist Leroy Brown.  He played locally in the shadow of his older pianist brother Linton Garner and moved to New York in 1944. He briefly worked with the bassist Slam Stewart\, and though not a bebop musician per se\, in 1947 played with Charlie Parker on the famous "Cool Blues" session. Although his admission to the Pittsburgh music union was initially refused because of his inability to read music\, they eventually relented in 1956 and made him an honorary member. Garner is credited with having a superb memory of music. After attending a concert by the Russian classical pianist Emil Gilels\, Garner returned to his apartment and was able to play a large portion of the performed music by recall.  Short in stature (5 ft 2 in)\, Garner performed sitting on multiple telephone directories.] Considering that his small hands could barely span an octave on the piano keyboard\, his rapid right-handed octave and chordal passages were all the more amazing. He was also known for his vocalizations while playing\, which can be heard on many of his recordings. He helped to bridge the gap for jazz musicians between nightclubs and the concert hall.  Garner made many tours both at home and abroad\, and produced a large volume of recorded work. He was\, reportedly\, The Tonight Show host Johnny Carson's favorite jazz musician\, appearing on Carson's show many times over the years.  Garner's first recordings were made in late 1944 at the apartment of Timme Rosenkrantz; these were subsequently issued as the five-volume Overture to Dawn series on Blue Note Records. His recording career advanced in the late 1940s when several sides such as "Fine and Dandy" and "Sweet 'n' Lovely" were cut. His 1955 live album Concert by the Sea was a best-selling jazz album in its day and features Eddie Calhoun on bass and Denzil Best on drums. This recording of a performance at the Sunset Center\, a former school in Carmel-by-the-Sea\, California\, was made using relatively primitive sound equipment\, but for George Avakian the decision to release the recording was easy. Other works include 1951's Long Ago and Far Away and 1974's Magician\, both of which see Garner perform a number of classic standards. Often the trio was expanded to add Latin percussion\, usually a conga.  In 1964\, Garner appeared in the UK on the music series Jazz 625 broadcast on the BBC's new second channel. The programme was hosted by Steve Race\, who introduced Garner's trio with Eddie Calhoun on bass and Kelly Martin on drums. Because Garner could not write down his musical ideas\, he used to record them on tape\, to be later transcribed by others.  Erroll Garner died from a cardiac arrest on January 2\, 1977. He is buried in Pittsburgh's Homewood Cemetery.  Erroll's accompanied by John Simmons (bass) and Alvin Stoller (drums).  Recorded in Los Angeles\, March 29\, 1949.

It was a disaster But before Christmas day was up\, guess who was making potholders? Everybody in the whole family And you can't even wrap this under the tree but\, here comes Christmas for me Just getting to hear my girls sing  Christmas\, Christmas time is near Time for toys and time for cheer We've been good\, but we can't last Hurry Christmas\, hurry fast Want a plane that loops the loop Me\, I want a hula hoop We can hardly stand the wait Please Christmas\, don't be late We can hardly stand the wait Please Christmas\, don't be late   Amy Grant has built a long\, successful career on music that matters.

It was a disaster But before Christmas day was up\, guess who was making potholders? Everybody in the whole family And you can't even wrap this under the tree but\, here comes Christmas for me Just getting to hear my girls sing  Christmas\, Christmas time is near Time for toys and time for cheer We've been good\, but we can't last Hurry Christmas\, hurry fast Want a plane that loops the loop Me\, I want a hula hoop We can hardly stand the wait Please Christmas\, don't be late We can hardly stand the wait Please Christmas\, don't be late   Amy Grant has built a long\, successful career on music that matters.

COL title VAL Star Dust COL performer VAL George Chisholm	COL video title VAL Ferrante & Teicher - Scarborough Fair (4/12) COL description VAL Ferrante & Teicher were a duo of American piano players\, known for their light arrangements of familiar classical pieces\, movie soundtracks\, and show tunes.  Scarborough Fair Trad. arr. Ferrante & Teicher  United Artists 6725  Arthur Ferrante (September 7\, 1921\, New York City -- September 19\, 2009)\, and Louis Teicher (August 24\, 1924\, Wilkes-Barre\, Pennsylvania -- August 3\, 2008) met while studying at the Juilliard School of Music in New York. Musical prodigies\, they began performing as a piano duo while still in school. After graduating\, they both joined the Juilliard faculty.  Steven Tyler of Aerosmith relates the story that in the 1950's the two students practiced in the home of his grandmother Constance Neidhart Tallarico.  In 1947\, they launched a full-time concert career\, at first playing nightclubs\, then quickly moving up to playing classical music with orchestral backing. Between 1950 and 1980\, they were a major American easy listening act\, and scored four big U.S. hits: "Theme From The Apartment" (Pop #10)\, "Theme From Exodus" (Pop #2)\, "Tonight" (Pop #8)\, and "Midnight Cowboy" (Pop #10). They performed and recorded regularly with pops orchestras popular standards by George Gershwin\, Jerome Kern\, Cole Porter\, Richard Rodgers and others. In 1973\, they did the Hollywood Radio Theater theme for the Rod Serling radio drama series\, The Zero Hour.  The duo also experimented with prepared pianos\, adding paper\, sticks\, rubber\, wood blocks\, metal bars\, chains\, glass\, mallets\, and other found objects to piano string beds. In this way they were able to produce a variety of bizarre sounds that sometimes resembled percussion instruments\, and at other times resulted in special effects that sounded as if they were electronically synthesized.  Both men were initiated as honorary members of Tau Kappa Epsilon at Central State University (now University of Central Oklahoma) while on tour.  Ferrante and Teicher ceased performing in 1989 and retired to Longboat Key and Siesta Key\, respectively\, both close to each other on the west coast of Florida. They continued to play together occasionally at a local piano store.  CDs of their music\, some of it not previously released\, have continued to appear.  Louis Teicher died in 2008\, three weeks before his 84th birthday. Arthur Ferrante died on September 19\, 2009 at 88 (he had once said he wanted to live one year for each piano key). Arthur is survived by his wife\, Jena; his daughter\, Brenda Eberhardt; and two granddaughters. COL channel name VAL MultiUriahheep	0

COL title VAL I Want to Know What Love Is COL performer VAL Sarah	COL video title VAL Tina Turner - Help (Music Video - 2010 Re-Master) COL description VAL Artist: Tina Turner Song: Help Year: 1984  This rare music video for 'Help'\, a Beatles cover\, by Tina Turner has been remastered to the best of my ability considering where the footage came from. I own a copy of an old 'Now That's What I Call Music Video' VHS from the 1980s\, which I bought purely for this clip. As far as I am aware\, this is the only 'official' release of the video on VHS or DVD formatt. I have fixed the colour\, made the video a little sharper\, and I used the CD audio of the song to remaster the video's audio which was in mono and very muddy.  This video is a gem\, and as a huge Tina fan\, an excellent find. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I do. COL channel name VAL beyoncesmaw	0

COL title VAL Moon River COL performer VAL Pixie Lott	COL video title VAL Gunter Noris and His Orchestra -  Swanee COL description VAL It was George Gershwin's very first "hit" and his biggest selling song : "Swanee".  The critics of the 1920's described the song as "infectious" and that actually was (and still is) a quite accurate description of this captivating tune.  The name linked forever to the song is that of Al Jolson who made the song a worldwide success but some people may also remember Judy Garland's version which was more extravert and outspoken than Jolson's "classic" interpretation. Here Gunter Noris captures the song's infectiousness by adding a pleasant sounding beat while bearing in mind the sound of the "golden twenties" as well. From the Album "Plays Gershwin" here's Gunter Noris and His Orchestra taking you back in time with Gershwin's "Swanee".  Enjoy. COL channel name VAL Socratess2007	0

COL title VAL Teach Me Tonight COL performer VAL Erin Boheme	COL video title VAL Roy Head - Pledging my love COL description VAL The song\, of course\, is the famous blues ballad which became a posthumous hit for Johnny Ace in 1955 after his self-inflicted accidental gunshot wound. It was written by Ferdinand Washington and Don Robey (of Duke Records)\, not Johnny Ace himself.  At this stage in his career Huey Meaux was trying various musical suits on Roy to see what might catch the public ear. This was the country Roy announced by the pedal steel as soon as the record starts.  This\, and other tracks\, come from the album "Country Crooner" which was issued in 1999 on Edsel as one of their Crazy Cajun series of albums which pulled together recordings produced by Huey P Meaux in Houston in the late '60's and '70's. Meaux used the Crazy Cajun name for one of a series of labels which he operated in the timeframe.  Roy Head had his one and only hit for Huey Meaux in 1965 with "Treat Her Right" which is rightly regarded as a classic of blue-eyed soul.  For a variety of reasons Roy didn't manage to follow this record up successfully. He drifted between labels until he came under control of Meaux again in\, I think\, the mid seventies. Two albums were issued of his music\, "Boogie Down" and "Rock'n'Roll My Soul". Edsel issued two albums in 1999 covering music from those albums\, the aforementioned "Country Crooner" and "White Texas Soul Shouter". I assume Edsel's intention was to cover the more soul and R&B oriented in the latter and the C&W ones in the former. The recordings themselves were apparently spread over a wide period from the late '60's through to the mid '70's.   The musicians present on most of these tracks were:  Dahrull Norris - Drums Ira Wilkes - Bass Peter Schless - Keyboards\, Synthesiser Lee O'Neil - Keyboards\, Synthesiser\, Arrangements Mike Pietzsch - Guitar Uncle Mickey Moody - Guitar\, Arrangements Lynn Groom - Guitar The Merlene Singers - Background vocals COL channel name VAL DangerousDaveRR	0

It has a twelve bar blues progression\, using only three chords until the coda.  In addition to Neal Hefti's original version\, and the television soundtrack version by Nelson Riddle\, versions were covered by The Marketts (single "Batman Theme" and album The Batman Theme by The Marketts)\, The Ventures (The Ventures Play the "Batman" Theme\, Dolton BST8042\, 3/1966)\, Al Hirt\, The Standells and actor/musician David McCallum.  The song has been widely parodied in the decades since its debut. The theme has been re-recorded by dozens of artists\, including Link Wray\, Voivod\, The Jam\, and The Who.  Adaptations  Jan & Dean on their 1966 album\, Jan And Dean Meet Batman. The Who recorded a cover of the theme in 1966.  The Kinks played a cover of the theme at their show at Kelvin Hall\, Glasgow\, in 1967. Adrian Henri and his band Liverpool Scene did a skit of the theme in the late 60s using Henri's poem Batpoem.

In 1966\, an album called Batman and Robin: The Sensational Guitars of Dan and Dale was released featuring members of the Sun Ra Arkestra and The Blues Project. The opening track is a cover of the "Batman Theme". Prince and R.E.M. used variations of the TV show theme in their work: Prince in the song "Batdance" (which appeared on the soundtrack to Tim Burton's 1989 movie)\, and R.E.M. in a rejected song for the Batman Returns soundtrack\, later released under the title "Winged Mammal Theme"\, as a B-side to the single "Drive". Voivod did a cover on their 1988 Dimension Hatröss album. Disciplina kicme did a cover on their album Najlepši hitovi! Uživo (1987). John Zorn\, led off his Naked City album on YouTube with a version of Batman (1990). The Well Paid Scientists produced an acid techno remix entitled To The Batrave......Let's Go in 1998.

COL title VAL It Ain't Me\, Babe COL performer VAL The Spokesmen	COL video title VAL Patsy Cline - The Wayward Wind COL description VAL One of the greatest singers in the history of country music\, Patsy Cline also helped blaze a trail for female singers to assert themselves as an integral part of the Nashville-dominated country music industry. She was not alone in this regard; Kitty Wells had become a star several years before Cline's big hits in the early '60s. Brenda Lee\, who shared Cline's producer\, did just as much to create a country-pop crossover during the same era; Skeeter Davis briefly enjoyed similar success. Cline has the most legendary aura of any female country singer\, however\, perhaps due to an early death that cut her off just after she had entered her prime.  Cline began recording in the mid-'50s\, and although she recorded quite a bit of material between 1955 and 1960 (17 singles in all)\, only one of them was a hit. That song\, "Walkin' After Midnight\," was both a classic and a Top 20 pop smash. Those who are accustomed to Cline's famous early-'60s hits are in for a bit of a shock when surveying her '50s sessions (which have been reissued on several Rhino compilations). At times she sang flat-out rockabilly; she also tried some churchy tear-weepers. She couldn't follow up "Walkin' After Midnight\," however\, in part because of an exploitative deal that limited her to songs from one publishing company.  Circumstances were not wholly to blame for Cline's commercial failures. She would have never made it as a rockabilly singer\, lacking the conviction of Wanda Jackson or the spunk of Brenda Lee. In fact\, in comparison with her best work\, she sounds rather stiff and ill-at-ease on most of her early singles. Things took a radical turn for the better on all fronts in 1960\, when her initial contract expired. With the help of producer Owen Bradley (who had worked on her sessions all along)\, Cline began selecting material that was both more suitable and of a higher quality than her previous outings.  "I Fall to Pieces\," cut at the very first session where Cline was at liberty to record what she wanted\, was the turning point in her career. Reaching number one in the country charts and number 12 pop\, it was the first of several country-pop crossovers she was to enjoy over the next couple of years. More important\, it set a prototype for commercial Nashville country at its best. Owen Bradley crafted lush orchestral arrangements\, with weeping strings and backup vocals by the Jordanaires\, that owed more to pop (in the best sense) than country.  The country elements were provided by the cream of Nashville's session musicians\, including guitarist Hank Garland\, pianist Floyd Cramer\, and drummer Buddy Harmon. Cline's voice sounded richer\, more confident\, and more mature\, with ageless wise and vulnerable qualities that have enabled her records to maintain their appeal with subsequent generations. When k.d. lang recorded her 1988 album Shadowland with Owen Bradley\, it was this phase of Cline's career that she was specifically attempting to emulate.  It's arguable that too much has been made of Cline's crossover appeal to the pop market. Brenda Lee\, whose records were graced with similar Bradley productions\, was actually more successful in this area (although her records were likely targeted toward a younger audience). Cline's appeal was undeniably more adult\, but she was always more successful with country listeners. Her final four Top Ten country singles\, in fact\, didn't make the pop Top 40.  Despite a severe auto accident in 1961\, Cline remained hot through 1961 and 1962\, with "Crazy" and "She's Got You" both becoming big country and pop hits. Much of her achingly romantic material was supplied by fresh talent like Hank Cochran\, Harlan Howard\, and Willie Nelson (who penned "Crazy"). Although her commercial momentum had faded slightly\, she was still at the top of her game when she died in a plane crash in March of 1963\, at the age of 30. She was only a big star for a couple of years\, but her influence was and remains huge. While the standards of professionalism on her recordings have been emulated ever since\, they've rarely been complemented by as much palpable\, at times heartbreaking emotion in the performances. For those who could do without some of more elaborate arrangements of her later years\, many of her relatively unadorned appearances on radio broadcasts have been thankfully preserved and issued.   ~ Richie Unterberger\, All Music Guide  PLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels\, Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

Noel\, Noel\, Noel\, Noel Born is the King of Israel!  They looked up and saw a star Shining in the East beyond them far And to the earth it gave great light And so it continued both day and night. Noel\, Noel\, Noel\, Noel Born is the King of Israel!  And by the light of that same star Three Wise men came from country far To seek for a King was their intent And to follow the star wherever it went. Noel\, Noel\, Noel\, Noel Born is the King of Israel!  This star drew nigh to the northwest O'er Bethlehem it took it's rest And there it did both Pause and stay Right o'er the place where Jesus lay. Noel\, Noel\, Noel\, Noel Born is the King of Israel!  Then entered in those Wise men three Full reverently upon their knee And offered there in His presence Their gold and myrrh and frankincense. Noel\, Noel\, Noel\, Noel Born is the King of Israel!  Then let us all with one accord Sing praises to our heavenly Lord That hath made Heaven and earth of nought And with his blood mankind has bought. Noel\, Noel\, Noel\, Noel Born is the King of Israel! COL channel name VAL lukshard	0

In 1947\, she was performing in concert in New Orleans with Gayten\, when the latter asked the young Fats Domino to come and play "Swanee River Boogie" on stage.[5] Recording for both the Regal and De Luxe labels between 1947 and 1950\, Laurie sang on several sides backed by Gayten's orchestra. Her first success was with her version of "Since I Fell for You" (1947)\, of which recording studio owner Cosimo Matassa said: "Annie Laurie did the first really good record that I liked... [She] was just fantastic\, I mean nobody will ever make another version like that."[6] She followed its success up with "Cuttin' Out" (1949)\, "You Ought To Know" (1950)\, "I Need Your Love" (1950)\, "Now That You're Gone" (1950) and "I'll Never Be Free (1950)."[1][7] Laurie also toured with Gayten's orchestra in 1951.[4][7]  Laurie's association with Regal Records ended in 1951\, and she started recording for Okeh. By 1956 her releases were issued on Savoy Records\, for whom she recorded in New York with Hal Singer's orchestra\, featuring guitarist Mickey Baker.[8][4] Her biggest hit came in 1957 when De Luxe Records released "It Hurts to Be in Love\,"[1] which was co-written by Julius Dixson and Rudy Toombs.[9] Other releases with De Luxe included the Andy Gibson co-written track\, "Hand in Hand" and "Love Is A Funny Thing (both 1957).[10][11] In July 1960\, Laurie appeared in concert\, sharing the bill with Screamin' Jay Hawkins\, the Five Satins\, Joe Turner\, Faye Adams\, Ben E. King\, and Nappy Brown\, at Chicago's Regal Theater.[12] The same month she had her final chart hit with "If You're Lonely."[2]  By 1962\, her affiliation had switched to Ritz Records\,[4] and she recorded several sides for them.[1]  However she left the music industry at this time\, devoting herself to the Jehovah's Witnesses COL channel name VAL AMNON SUODAI	0

TESTO DELLA CANZONE E BIOGRAFIA DELL'INTERPRETE  TESTO: Tornerai / da me perché l'unico sogno sei / del mio cuor. Tornerai / tu perché senza i tuoi baci languidi / non vivrò. Ho qui dentro ognor la tua voce che dice / tremando "amor". Tornerò / perché tuo è il mio cuor.  Tu sai che t'amo: / non ho che te mi stai lontano: / dimmi perché? La nostalgia / non senti in cuor? Non ti ricordi di me? Questa mia vita / non può durar\, tu sei fuggita / devi tornar: questo mio cuor / ti vuole ancor.  Tornerò / perché tuo è il mio cuor.  BIOGRAFIA (da ildiscobolo.net)  Si chiamava il realtà Guido Di Luca ed era nato a Livorno nel 1903. Dopo una attivissima carriera radiofonica (fu tra l'altro in radio uno dei tre moschettieri nella celebre rubrica degli anni '30) e discografica che lo videro incidere decine di 78 giri  prevalentemente per la Parlophon quando questa etichetta era in Italia prodotta e distribuita dalla Cetra.   Emigrò negli anni cinquanta negli Stati Uniti \, ove continuò a lavorare come attore\, spesso affiancato da nomi molto noti dello spettacolo americano. Morì \, proprio negli USA nel 1991.   Fu tra l'altro il marito della nota attrice Lilla Brignone\, scomparsa nel 1984\, conosciuta proprio alla radio durante la lavorazione di una delle tante commedie radiofoniche ale quali partecipò.   Molte le incisioni da lui realizzate affiancato dal Trio delle sorelle Lescano : Balliamo il passo Lambeth Bimba mia non mi resistere Casetta mia Disillusione Giovanotti Girotondo dell'amore Il maestro innamorato La ragazza del giornale Ladro d'amore Son tutte belle Un anno di baci Un po' di sole Una ninna-nanna COL channel name VAL Melodieantiche	0

COL title VAL Summertime COL performer VAL Joanie Sommers	COL video title VAL Toy Factory - Summertime (1970) COL description VAL Banda: Toy Factory Album: ST (1970) Origem: Estados Unidos Gravadora: AVCO Embassy - AVLP 7014   Though we haven't been able to track down much bibliographical information on this late-60s bi-racial outfit\, we think they were from Long Island\, New York. From the liner notes on their LP we can also tell you Greg Weiss was the lead singer and was responsible for writing roughly half the material. The rest of the line up consisted of bassist Bill\, guitarist Billy\, drummer Joey and keyboard player Sal (great detail there). Produced by Bernie Lawrence\, the majority of 1970's "Toy Factory" found the band trying to fight their way through rather faceless MOR pop. Lead singer Greg Weiss had a decent voice\, but on tracks such as "What Is Youth"\, "To Live or Die" and "Honey\, Forever" he employed an irritating faux-English accent that recalled Davy Jones (he sounds like David Hemmings to me Bad Cat!!!). He also had an irritating habit of throwing mock sobs and groans into the mix ("When I'm with You" and "Honey Forever"). Strike three were the occasional French lyrics (don't pick on the French Bad Cat!!!) he tossed into the mix ("To Live or Die" and "Honey Forever"). Curiously\, the band was at their best when they cut loose and go for a harder rock sound. In this case\, the pseudo-psychedelic "No Rhyme To Orange" (sporting a nice fuzz guitar solo) and "Things" was a nifty slice of blue-eyed soul. "Summertime" also found the band turning in one of the weirdest George Gershwin covers we've ever heard (pretty decent guitar here too Bad Cat!!!). This one certainly won't change your life\, but it's one of those period failures that's worth checking out. (Tyme Machine Blog) COL channel name VAL Melomano Discos	1

TESTO DELLA CANZONE E BIOGRAFIA DELL'INTERPRETE  TESTO: Tornerai / da me perché l'unico sogno sei / del mio cuor. Tornerai / tu perché senza i tuoi baci languidi / non vivrò. Ho qui dentro ognor la tua voce che dice / tremando "amor". Tornerò / perché tuo è il mio cuor.  Tu sai che t'amo: / non ho che te mi stai lontano: / dimmi perché? La nostalgia / non senti in cuor? Non ti ricordi di me? Questa mia vita / non può durar\, tu sei fuggita / devi tornar: questo mio cuor / ti vuole ancor.  Tornerò / perché tuo è il mio cuor.

When it became clear that Allen was the best singer in the new group\, he became the front man\, and Frank Cook\, previously of Canned Heat\, came into the band on drums. Originally known as the Pacific Gas and Electric Blues Band\, they shortened their name when they signed to Kent Records\, releasing the album Get It On in early 1968. The record was not a success\, but following the band's performance at the Miami Pop Festival in May 1968 they were signed by Columbia Records.[1][2] Their first album for Columbia\, Pacific Gas and Electric\, was issued in 1969\, but they achieved greater success with their next album\, Are You Ready in 1970. The title track reached # 14 on the Billboard Hot 100.[3] After the album was recorded\, Cook was injured in a car accident and was replaced on drums by Ron Woods\, Cook staying on as manager. Marshall and Schwartz left\, and were replaced by Frank Petricca (bass) and Ken Utterback (guitar)\, with Brent Block moving to rhythm guitar before leaving later in 1970. Unusually for the time\, the band contained both black and white musicians\, which led to rioting and gunfire on one occasion when the band\, who toured widely\, performed in Raleigh\, North Carolina.[1] In 1971\, the band changed their name to PG&E\, following pressure from the utility company of the same name. The band also expanded\, Allen\, Woods\, Petricca and Utterback being joined by Jerry Aiello (keyboards)\, Stanley Abernathy (trumpet)\, Alfred Galagos and Virgil Gonsalves (saxophones)\, and Joe Lala (percussion). They recorded the album PG&E\, and also appeared in and provided music for the Otto Preminger film Tell Me That You Love Me\, Junie Moon starring Liza Minnelli. The band then split up. A final album using the name\, Pacific Gas & Electric Starring Charlie Allen\, was recorded by Allen with studio musicians and released on the Dunhill label in 1973.[1][2] For a time the group also included Rick Durrett formerly of the band The Coven on keyboards.[citation needed] Tom Marshall later suffered deteriorating health and personal circumstances\, being homeless since the 1980s.[4] Frank Petricca became a commodity broker.[5] Charlie Allen died in 1990\, aged 48.[6]  Past members Charlie Allen Tom Marshall (1967--70) Brent Block (1967--70) Glenn Schwartz (1967--70) Frank Cook (1967--70) Ron Woods (1970--72) Frank Petricca (1970--72) Ken Utterback (1970--72) Jerry Aiello (1971--72) Stanley Abernathy (1971--72) Alfred Galagos (1971--72) Virgil Gonsalves (1971--72) Joe Lala (1971--72) COL channel name VAL ozzyserbia	0

I have placed the song here to try to bring more attention to the release. It seems that many are unaware of it's existence. Support the artist and get the download from Itunes\, Amazon\, etc.  Bettye LaVette - vocals  Alan Hill - piano  John Heard: Bass  Danny Frankel: percussion  Tom Hagerman: strings & string arrangements   Produced & mixed by Rob Schnapf  Recorded at Sonara Recorders  Mastered by Mark Chalecki at Little Red Book Mastering   Song writing credits:  Change Is Gonna Come - Sam Cooke   Round Midnight - Thelonious Monk   God Bless The Child - Billie Holiday / Arthur Herzog   Lush Life - Billy Strayhorn   Ain't No Sunshine - Bill Withers   Ain't That Lovin' You - Jimmy Reed  Official Press Release  Having conquered the ghosts of a hard-luck past on her GRAMMY-nominated CD The Scene of the Crime\, BETTYE LAVETTE shines a new light on that past with her latest\, A CHANGE IS GONNA COME SESSIONS. The digital-only EP for Anti- Records\, available exclusively through iTunes starting June 16\, revisits BETTYE's forgotten post-Atlantic Records years as a nightclub singer\, Broadway performer\, and touring cast member opposite Cab Calloway in "Bubbling Brown Sugar."    The EP opens with a stirring solo version of Sam Cooke's posthumous Civil Rights anthem "A Change Is Gonna Come\," a song which BETTYE sang with Jon Bon Jovi in January as part of the "We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial" concert. Joining BETTYE for these Sessions are pianist and musical director Al Hill\, veteran bassist John Heard -- who has accompanied such luminaries as Count Basie\, Cole Porter\, Ella Fitzgerald\, and Art Pepper -- drummer Danny Frankel (k.d. lang\, Lou Reed)\, and Tom Hagerman from DeVotchKa on strings.    A mix of standards and soul classics from BETTYE's 1970s stage and nightclub repertoire rounds out the 6-song set\, including songs by Thelonious Monk\, Duke Ellington\, Bill Withers\, and Jimmy Reed. A rendition of Billie Holiday's "God Bless The Child" -- a song that BETTYE first performed with show-stopping magnificence in "Bubbling Brown Sugar" -- highlights BETTYE's vocal mastery. Rather than attack\, BETTYE approaches these tracks with subtlety -- while nonetheless wresting every ounce and every nuance of meaning from the words she sings. Once more\, BETTYE provides the definitive answer to the question posed by NPR in its review of The Scene of the Crime: "Is there any soul singer who brings more guts\, more conviction and more emotion to her singing?" Absolutely not. COL channel name VAL imnokid	1

Det var sol och sommar över gröna hagar när som artonåring jag därhemma var. Och de minnen som står kvar från dessa dagar är de bästa och de vackraste jag har.  Ifrån landet uti väster tanken glider hem till kära gamla Sverige då och då. Fast det nu har svunnit många\, långa tider barndomshemmet har jag aldrig glömt ändå.  Jag är gammal och nu lever jag på minnet av mitt hem och mina vackra drömmars land. Vad som fordom bruka fängsla barnasinnet står så tydligt för min inre syn ibland. Uti hemmet fick jag allt vad jag begärde jag förstod det kanske ej förr’n jag blev stor. Och föräldrarna mig livets goda lärde. Nu de äro borta både far och mor.

COL title VAL Blue Monk COL performer VAL Kim Pensyl & Phil DeGreg	COL video title VAL Roy Head - Pledging my love COL description VAL The song\, of course\, is the famous blues ballad which became a posthumous hit for Johnny Ace in 1955 after his self-inflicted accidental gunshot wound. It was written by Ferdinand Washington and Don Robey (of Duke Records)\, not Johnny Ace himself.  At this stage in his career Huey Meaux was trying various musical suits on Roy to see what might catch the public ear. This was the country Roy announced by the pedal steel as soon as the record starts.  This\, and other tracks\, come from the album "Country Crooner" which was issued in 1999 on Edsel as one of their Crazy Cajun series of albums which pulled together recordings produced by Huey P Meaux in Houston in the late '60's and '70's. Meaux used the Crazy Cajun name for one of a series of labels which he operated in the timeframe.  Roy Head had his one and only hit for Huey Meaux in 1965 with "Treat Her Right" which is rightly regarded as a classic of blue-eyed soul.  For a variety of reasons Roy didn't manage to follow this record up successfully. He drifted between labels until he came under control of Meaux again in\, I think\, the mid seventies. Two albums were issued of his music\, "Boogie Down" and "Rock'n'Roll My Soul". Edsel issued two albums in 1999 covering music from those albums\, the aforementioned "Country Crooner" and "White Texas Soul Shouter". I assume Edsel's intention was to cover the more soul and R&B oriented in the latter and the C&W ones in the former. The recordings themselves were apparently spread over a wide period from the late '60's through to the mid '70's.   The musicians present on most of these tracks were:  Dahrull Norris - Drums Ira Wilkes - Bass Peter Schless - Keyboards\, Synthesiser Lee O'Neil - Keyboards\, Synthesiser\, Arrangements Mike Pietzsch - Guitar Uncle Mickey Moody - Guitar\, Arrangements Lynn Groom - Guitar The Merlene Singers - Background vocals COL channel name VAL DangerousDaveRR	0

A founding member of the group was Dionne Warwick\, who was later replaced by her aunt\, Cissy Houston. The Sweet Inspirations was founded by former members of The Drinkard Singers\, a long-running Gospel singing group whose membership included Cissy Houston (née Drinkard\, and mother of Whitney Houston\, 1963) and Lee Warwick\, who was Cissy's sister and the mother of Sweet Inspirations members Dee Dee and Dionne Warwick). As a backup group\, the Sweet Inspirations were in high demand among producers\, publishers\, artists\, and songwriters in the early 1960s. The original lineup included Doris Troy and the two Warwick sisters Dionne & Dee Dee. Sylvia Shemwell (sister of Judy Clay) replaced Troy\, while Cissy Houston took over from Dionne\, with Dee Dee Warwick as the group's official leader. The group sang backup for many stars\, including Solomon Burke\, Aretha Franklin\, Wilson Pickett\, and Esther Phillips. Dee Dee left in 1965\, when her solo career began to take off. She was replaced by Myrna Smith. Estelle Brown joined the team soon after\, and the line-up that was to become an Atlantic recording group was set. The Sweet Inspirations recorded by themselves for the first time in April 1967 for Atlantic Records. That session produced the first two singles released by Atlantic\, a version of "Why (Am I Treated So Bad)\," a song previously recorded by The Staple Singers and a soulful version of "Let It Be Me"\, a French song which had been a pop and R&B hit for Betty Everett & Jerry Butler in 1964.

COL title VAL J'ai peur de l'automne COL performer VAL Jean Sablon	COL video title VAL Sarah Vaughan with Clifford Brown - September Song (EmArcy Records 1954) COL description VAL "September Song" is an American pop standard composed by Kurt Weill\, with lyric by Maxwell Anderson\, introduced by Walter Huston in the 1938 Broadway musical Knickerbocker Holiday. It has since been recorded by numerous singers and instrumentalists. It was also used in the 1950 film September Affair\, and for the credits in the television series May to December (a quote from the opening line of the song).  Although the song was written as an old man's lament for the passing of his youth\, some of the most famous versions have been recorded by women artists. Thus Sarah Vaughan's version of 1955\, and Ella Fitzgerald's with pianist Paul Smith on the 1960 Verve release Ella Fitzgerald Sings Songs From Let No Man Write My Epitaph are both regarded as Jazz classics. Eartha Kitt and Weill's wife Lotte Lenya both recorded the song in 1957\, and Jo Stafford\, Patti Page as well as Anne Shelton also recorded versions during the 1950s. In 1958 Eydie Gormé included the song in her album\, Love is the season and in 1989 both Lena Horne in The Men in My Life\, and Julie Wilson in an album of Kurt Weill songs.  Personally this song reminds me of waking up in on an early Saturday morning just as the sun starts to pierce through the window shade slits and the flowers outside with morning dew start to open up. As one eye slightly opens up and then the other followed by a fisted hand arm stretch and yawn... then Sarah starts to sing this song... oh so beautifully!  Sarah's accompanied by Leader/Arranger: Ernie Wilkins\, Clifford Brown (trumpet)\, Herbie Mann (flute)\, Paul Quinichette (tenor)\, Jimmy Jones (piano)\, Joe Benjamin (bass)\, and Roy Haynes (drums). Recorded in New York\, December 18\, 1954. (EmArcy Records)  For it's a long\, long while from May to December\, But the days grow short when you reach September.  And the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame One hasn't got time for the waiting game.  And the days dwindle down to a precious few September\, November  And these few precious days I'll spend with you. These golden days I'll spend With you  And these few precious days I'll spend with you. Not January\, February\, June or July....  September COL channel name VAL RoundMidnightTV	1

COL title VAL Sugar Me COL performer VAL Claudine Longet	COL video title VAL Gerry Gibbs - 2015 - Live In Studio - 07 Alfie COL description VAL Personnel Kenny Barron: piano Ron Carter: acoustic bass Gerry Gibbs: drums Roy Hargrove: trumpet\, flugelhorn  Composers Burt Bacharach H. David  Drummer Gerry Gibbs has been living a recurring dream with slight variations for the past few years. In December of 2012\, he laid down tracks with two of his idols—the legendary Ron Carter and the estimable Kenny Barron—and dubbed their group the Thrasher Dream Trio. The eponymous debut from that band\, featuring fifteen tracks recorded at those sessions\, was\, not surprisingly\, a strong and classy affair filled with standards\, some originals\, and other jazz-friendly fare\, such as Stevie Wonder's "Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing" and Burt Bacharach's "Promises\, Promises."   At the time of that album's release\, those last-mentioned tracks could simply be viewed as part of the well-rounded program. But looking back now\, it actually seems like they were dropped as hints of what was to come. About a year-and-a-half after that first Thrasher Dream Trio album was recorded\, Gibbs brought the band together again to lay things down for We're Back (Whaling City Sound\, 2014)\, a jazz-does-R&B project with A-list guests—vibraphonist Warren Wolf\, saxophonist Steve Wilson\, and organist Larry Goldings. That album offered multiple helpings of Wonder and Earth\, Wind & Fire along with single servings of Bacharach\, Marvin Gaye\, Miles Davis\, and the Average White Band. As on the trio's first album\, the sparks were flying. The playing field\, however\, had changed a bit.   For this\, the third go-around for this group\, Gibbs does it again\, tweaking the formula without altering the essence of the trio. This time he turned the focus toward pop-ish material from the '50s and '60s—the work of Bacharach\, Henry Mancini\, Michel Legrand\, and others of that ilk—and put an audience in front of the band\, recording live at Systems Two Recording Studio. Guests are part of the package again—now it's trumpeter Roy Hargrove and vocalist Cassandra Wilson\, each appearing on a few tracks—and they help to add another wrinkle or two to the project without drawing focus away from the trio.   The album opens on a fluid "Wives And Lovers" that allows Barron's lyricism to shine through\, gives Carter a chance to step into the spotlight\, and puts Gibbs' brushwork at center stage. From there\, the trio moves on with an unusually upbeat take on "The Summer Knows\," a Wilson-enhanced version of "The Look Of Love" that moves from bossa nova to swing\, and a variety of other familiar hits of yesteryear. Hargrove joins in for "On A Clear Day\," quoting Ellington at one point and playfully trading solos with Gibbs; Vince Guaraldi's cheerfulness shines through on a perky trio performance of his "Cast Your Fate To The Wind"; "More" is transformed from a stale confection into an enjoyable swinger; and "Watch What Happens" happens twice—first as a cheerful\, Brazilian-based instrumental\, then as a swing-centered feature for Wilson.   Along the way there are plenty of other bright spots—an appropriately noir-ish "What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life?" with Hargrove on flugelhorn\, a leisurely stroll through "Girl Talk"—and plenty of moments that serve as simple reminders as to why Barron and Carter are loved\, respected\, and emulated the world over. Their time and taste are impeccable\, and when married to Gibbs' in-the-tradition drumming\, you know the music is going to go in the right direction every time.

Noone's playing is lyrical and sophisticated\, and certainly makes more use of "sweet" flavoring. Noone was an important influence on later clarinetists such as Artie Shaw and Benny Goodman. He started playing guitar in his home town and at the age of 15\, he switched to the clarinet and moved to New Orleans. He studied with Lorenzo Tio and with the young Sidney Bechet\, who was only 13 at the time. By 1912\, he was playing professionally with Kid Ory\, Papa Celestin\, the Eagle Band before joining the Original Creole Orchestra in Chicago in 1917. The following year\, he joined King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band\, then in 1926\, he started leading the band at Chicago's Apex Club\, the Jimmie Noone's Apex Club Orchestra\, in which the influential pianist Earl Hines was playing for a time. In  1943 he moved to Los Angeles\, where he died suddenly of a heart attack. The Kid Ory's band played for him the blues titled "Blues for Jimmie" on the radio\, and the number eventually became a regular feature for the Ory band. COL channel name VAL 240252	0

Born Anita Belle Colton\, O'Day was admired for her sense of rhythm and dynamics\, and her early big band appearances shattered the traditional image of the "girl singer". Refusing to pander to any female stereotype\, O'Day presented herself as a "hip" jazz musician\, wearing a band jacket and skirt as opposed to an evening gown. She changed her surname from Colton to O'Day\, pig Latin for "dough\," slang for money. COL channel name VAL Music Legends Book	0

COL title VAL Silver Bells COL performer VAL Steven Curtis Chapman	COL video title VAL 'Round Midnight - Bettye LaVette COL description VAL This song is from an EP that was a digital-only release by Anti- Records. I have placed the song here to try to bring more attention to the release. It seems that many are unaware of it's existence. Support the artist and get the download from Itunes\, Amazon\, etc.  Bettye LaVette - vocals  Alan Hill - piano  John Heard: Bass  Danny Frankel: percussion  Tom Hagerman: strings & string arrangements   Produced & mixed by Rob Schnapf  Recorded at Sonara Recorders  Mastered by Mark Chalecki at Little Red Book Mastering   Song writing credits:  Change Is Gonna Come - Sam Cooke   Round Midnight - Thelonious Monk   God Bless The Child - Billie Holiday / Arthur Herzog   Lush Life - Billy Strayhorn   Ain't No Sunshine - Bill Withers   Ain't That Lovin' You - Jimmy Reed  Official Press Release  Having conquered the ghosts of a hard-luck past on her GRAMMY-nominated CD The Scene of the Crime\, BETTYE LAVETTE shines a new light on that past with her latest\, A CHANGE IS GONNA COME SESSIONS. The digital-only EP for Anti- Records\, available exclusively through iTunes starting June 16\, revisits BETTYE's forgotten post-Atlantic Records years as a nightclub singer\, Broadway performer\, and touring cast member opposite Cab Calloway in "Bubbling Brown Sugar."    The EP opens with a stirring solo version of Sam Cooke's posthumous Civil Rights anthem "A Change Is Gonna Come\," a song which BETTYE sang with Jon Bon Jovi in January as part of the "We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial" concert. Joining BETTYE for these Sessions are pianist and musical director Al Hill\, veteran bassist John Heard -- who has accompanied such luminaries as Count Basie\, Cole Porter\, Ella Fitzgerald\, and Art Pepper -- drummer Danny Frankel (k.d. lang\, Lou Reed)\, and Tom Hagerman from DeVotchKa on strings.    A mix of standards and soul classics from BETTYE's 1970s stage and nightclub repertoire rounds out the 6-song set\, including songs by Thelonious Monk\, Duke Ellington\, Bill Withers\, and Jimmy Reed. A rendition of Billie Holiday's "God Bless The Child" -- a song that BETTYE first performed with show-stopping magnificence in "Bubbling Brown Sugar" -- highlights BETTYE's vocal mastery. Rather than attack\, BETTYE approaches these tracks with subtlety -- while nonetheless wresting every ounce and every nuance of meaning from the words she sings. Once more\, BETTYE provides the definitive answer to the question posed by NPR in its review of The Scene of the Crime: "Is there any soul singer who brings more guts\, more conviction and more emotion to her singing?" Absolutely not. COL channel name VAL imnokid	0

COL title VAL Cry Me a River COL performer VAL Natalie Cole	COL video title VAL Ella Fitzgerald - Cry Me A River (Verve Records 1961) COL description VAL "Cry Me a River" is a popular American torch song\, written by Arthur Hamilton and first published in 1953\, and made famous in the version by Julie London\, 1955.  A jazzy blues ballad\, "Cry Me a River" was originally written for Ella Fitzgerald to sing in the 1920s-set film\, Pete Kelly's Blues (released 1955) but the song was dropped. It has been said that it was dropped because\, at the time of Ella's recording\, film and record producers said that the audience would not believe that a "colored/black" person would know what the word Plebeian meant nor would they use it. They were afraid that Ella's vocals combined with the use of such an "intelligent" word would upset their target audience.  Fitzgerald first released a recording of the song on Clap Hands\, Here Comes Charlie! in 1961.   The song's first release and most famous recording was by actress/singer Julie London in 1955\, backed by Barney Kessel on guitar and Ray Leatherwood on bass. A sultry performance of the song by London in the 1956 film The Girl Can't Help It helped to make it a million-selling blockbuster (#9 US/#22 UK). London's recording was later featured in the soundtrack's for the movies 'Passion of Mind (2000)\, and V for Vendetta (2005).  Barbra Streisand sang this song on her 1963 debut album as the opening track of Side 1. In 1970\, British blues rocker Joe Cocker made the chart with an upbeat rock rendition on the album\, Mad Dogs and Englishmen. In 1995\, British actress Denise Welch's double A-side "You Don't Have to Say You Love Me" / "Cry Me a River" spent three weeks in the UK Singles Chart\, reaching #23. Canadian jazz pianist and singer Diana Krall recorded the song on her 2001 album\, The Look of Love. In 2009\, Canadian singer Michael Bublé entered the charts with a big-band jazz version\, which is also the opening track of his fourth album Crazy Love. This adaption of the song was used in the BBC's advertising and theme music for coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.  Ella Jane Fitzgerald (April 25\, 1917 – June 15\, 1996) was an American jazz vocalist with a vocal range spanning three octaves (D♭3 to D♭6). Often referred to as the "First Lady of Song\," the "Queen of Jazz" and "Lady Ella\," she was noted for her purity of tone\, impeccable diction\, phrasing and intonation\, and a "horn-like" improvisational ability\, particularly in her scat singing.  Fitzgerald was a notable interpreter of the Great American Songbook. Over the course of her 60-year recording career\, she sold 40 million copies of her 70-plus albums\, won 13 Grammy Awards and was awarded the National Medal of Arts by Ronald Reagan and the Presidential Medal of Freedom by George H. W. Bush.  Ella's accompanied by Lou Levy (piano); Herb Ellis (guitar); Joe Mondragon (bass); and Gus Johnson (drums).  Recorded June 23\, 1961\, Los Angeles (Verve Records)  Now you say you're lonely You cried the long night through Well\, you can cry me a river Cry me a river I cried a river over you Now you say you're sorry For being so untrue Well\, you can cry me a river Cry me a river I cried a river over you You drove me\, Nearly drove me out of my head While you never shed a tear Remember?

While this isn't the way you remember hearing these songs back in the day\, Phillips reaches into the material with an obvious love and respect\, and he finds a beautifully melancholy essence in these tunes that makes for a satisfying marriage of artist and material.

Sangen er blevet indspillet af mange: Bob Dylan\, Peter\, Paul and Mary\, Waylon Jennings\, Rod Stewart o.m.a. Pladeselskabet RCA syntes\, at det var en klassiker som sikkert ville gøre sig i en ny pigtrådsindspilning - selvom sangen stilmæssigt lå langt fra vort faste repertoire.

COL description VAL ClassiKhan From Wikipedia\, the free encyclopedia ClassiKhan  Studio album by Chaka Khan Released October 5\, 2004 Genre Vocal\, Jazz Label Sanctuary Records (U.K.) Earthsong / AgU Music Group (U.S.) JVC Victor (Japan) Producer Ira Schickman Eve Nelson Chaka Khan Professional reviews Allmusic  [1] Chaka Khan chronology Dance Classics of Chaka Khan (1999) ClassiKhan (2004) The Platinum Collection (2006) ClassiKhan is the twelfth studio album by American R&B/funk singer Chaka Khan\, featuring the London Symphony Orchestra\, Produced and arranged by Eve Nelson and released in 2004 on the at the time still independent label Sanctuary Records in the U.K.\, on Earthsong/AgU Music Group in the U.S. and in 2005 also in Japan on JVC Victor. As Allmusic point out in their review\, with Khan's well-known affinity and acclaim for interpreting jazz standards in mind\, which through most of her career on the Warner Bros. label had been relegated to the backburner\, an album with the title ClassiKhan could at first glance very easily be mistaken for being a belated sequel to 1982's Echoes of an Era. While the album indeed does focus on jazz and swing standards like "Stormy Weather"\, "Hazel's Hips"\, "Round Midnight" and "Teach Me Tonight" it also features an eclectic selection of classics from other genres\, like pop culture favourites such as Broadway show tune "Hey Big Spender" from the musical Sweet Charity\, Peggy Lee's "Is That All There Is?" penned by Leiber & Stoller and even a 60's country and western classic in the form of Patsy Cline's "Crazy"\, written by Willie Nelson. ClassiKhan also features the themes of classic film favourites from Khan's youth\, "To Sir With Love" and the James Bond themes "Goldfinger" and "Diamonds Are Forever". The collection concludes with one new composition\, the ballad "I Believe"\, co-written by Khan and the album's producer Ira Shickman. The title ClassiKhan is naturally also a reference to Khan's accompaniment on the set. On the Echoes of an Era album it was a five-piece all-star jazz ensemble\, on ClassiKhan it is The New York All Star Musicians - but with the addition of the full London Symphony Orchestra\, conducted and arranged by Eve Nelson and with orchestrations by producer Ira Schickman and Gary Anderson. The album was mainly recorded at London's legendary Abbey Road Studios and it features guest appearances by among others pianist Joe Sample and percussionist Sheila E.\, best known for her work with Prince. ClassiKhan was both a critical and commercial success\, even reaching #42 on Billboard's R&B albums chart. COL channel name VAL ChakaFanTV	0

COL title VAL Alone Together COL performer VAL Jo Stafford	COL video title VAL Cliff Bennett & the Rebel Rousers #2 COL description VAL From the Cliff Bennett website:  Cliff Bennett & the Rebel Rousers were the first London band to be signed by the Beatles manager\, Brian Epstein. Their innovative brass sound introduced British youth to soul music. Within three months of Epstein's management\, the band had their first UK hit single with "One Way Love" and a tour of Germany with The Beatles. They were the first British band to be signed to the Motown label.   Cliff crowned his success with the Rebel Rousers in 1966 with a song written exclusively for him by Lennon & McCartney - "Got To Get You Into My Life" which reached No. 3 in the UK charts\, creating a unique British soul sound. Their other hits include: "Back In the USSR"\, "One Way Love" and "I'll Take You Home"   On June 24\, 1966 Bennett & the Rebel Rousers opened up for the Beatles at the Circus Krone-Bau concert in Munich\, Germany.  In this clip the band does "C C Rider."  BTW ... The Rebel Rousers are using the drums from the Rattles\, another group playing at that show.

Det var sol och sommar över gröna hagar när som artonåring jag därhemma var. Och de minnen som står kvar från dessa dagar är de bästa och de vackraste jag har.  Ifrån landet uti väster tanken glider hem till kära gamla Sverige då och då. Fast det nu har svunnit många\, långa tider barndomshemmet har jag aldrig glömt ändå.  Jag är gammal och nu lever jag på minnet av mitt hem och mina vackra drömmars land. Vad som fordom bruka fängsla barnasinnet står så tydligt för min inre syn ibland. Uti hemmet fick jag allt vad jag begärde jag förstod det kanske ej förr’n jag blev stor. Och föräldrarna mig livets goda lärde. Nu de äro borta både far och mor.

COL title VAL Frenesi COL performer VAL Trio Los Panchos	COL video title VAL Gerry Gibbs - 2015 - Live In Studio - 07 Alfie COL description VAL Personnel Kenny Barron: piano Ron Carter: acoustic bass Gerry Gibbs: drums Roy Hargrove: trumpet\, flugelhorn  Composers Burt Bacharach H. David  Drummer Gerry Gibbs has been living a recurring dream with slight variations for the past few years. In December of 2012\, he laid down tracks with two of his idols—the legendary Ron Carter and the estimable Kenny Barron—and dubbed their group the Thrasher Dream Trio. The eponymous debut from that band\, featuring fifteen tracks recorded at those sessions\, was\, not surprisingly\, a strong and classy affair filled with standards\, some originals\, and other jazz-friendly fare\, such as Stevie Wonder's "Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing" and Burt Bacharach's "Promises\, Promises."   At the time of that album's release\, those last-mentioned tracks could simply be viewed as part of the well-rounded program. But looking back now\, it actually seems like they were dropped as hints of what was to come. About a year-and-a-half after that first Thrasher Dream Trio album was recorded\, Gibbs brought the band together again to lay things down for We're Back (Whaling City Sound\, 2014)\, a jazz-does-R&B project with A-list guests—vibraphonist Warren Wolf\, saxophonist Steve Wilson\, and organist Larry Goldings. That album offered multiple helpings of Wonder and Earth\, Wind & Fire along with single servings of Bacharach\, Marvin Gaye\, Miles Davis\, and the Average White Band. As on the trio's first album\, the sparks were flying. The playing field\, however\, had changed a bit.   For this\, the third go-around for this group\, Gibbs does it again\, tweaking the formula without altering the essence of the trio. This time he turned the focus toward pop-ish material from the '50s and '60s—the work of Bacharach\, Henry Mancini\, Michel Legrand\, and others of that ilk—and put an audience in front of the band\, recording live at Systems Two Recording Studio. Guests are part of the package again—now it's trumpeter Roy Hargrove and vocalist Cassandra Wilson\, each appearing on a few tracks—and they help to add another wrinkle or two to the project without drawing focus away from the trio.   The album opens on a fluid "Wives And Lovers" that allows Barron's lyricism to shine through\, gives Carter a chance to step into the spotlight\, and puts Gibbs' brushwork at center stage. From there\, the trio moves on with an unusually upbeat take on "The Summer Knows\," a Wilson-enhanced version of "The Look Of Love" that moves from bossa nova to swing\, and a variety of other familiar hits of yesteryear. Hargrove joins in for "On A Clear Day\," quoting Ellington at one point and playfully trading solos with Gibbs; Vince Guaraldi's cheerfulness shines through on a perky trio performance of his "Cast Your Fate To The Wind"; "More" is transformed from a stale confection into an enjoyable swinger; and "Watch What Happens" happens twice—first as a cheerful\, Brazilian-based instrumental\, then as a swing-centered feature for Wilson.   Along the way there are plenty of other bright spots—an appropriately noir-ish "What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life?" with Hargrove on flugelhorn\, a leisurely stroll through "Girl Talk"—and plenty of moments that serve as simple reminders as to why Barron and Carter are loved\, respected\, and emulated the world over. Their time and taste are impeccable\, and when married to Gibbs' in-the-tradition drumming\, you know the music is going to go in the right direction every time.

It has become a pop standard and an even more popular country song since it helped make Hank Williams famous in the 1940s. Published through Tin Pan Alley in 1922\, the song was first recorded by the popular contralto Elsie Clark. Later that year\, it was recorded by Jack Shea (not the 1932 Olympic medalist speed skater) on Vocalion 14333. This recording contains a verse that no later versions include. Emmett Miller recorded it on Okeh 40465\, September 1\, 1925. He re-recorded it on June 12 1928\, accompanied by his Georgia Crackers (which included Tommy Dorsey\, Jimmy Dorsey\, Eddie Lang\, and Leo McConville). On November 26\, 1926\, blues singer Bertha "Chippie" Hill recorded a different song titled "Lovesick Blues" (Okeh 8453). The song was a minor hit for her. The first country music version of the song was by Rex Griffin (Decca 5570)\, September 25\, 1939. The song's most recognizable version did not come until 1948\, with Williams' hit rendition. Though Williams had scored a few hits prior to "Lovesick Blues\," the song was the first of many number one hits on Country radio for the singer. It also marked one of the songwriter's few cover songs. The song's monumental success led to Williams' tenure at the Grand Ole Opry and remains one of his best remembered songs. In 2004\, it was one of 50 recordings chosen that year by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry. His version of the song appeared in such films as The Last Picture Show (1971) and The Shawshank Redemption (1994). Since Williams' hit rendition of the song\, it has been covered by a wide array of performers. Country performers including Slim Whitman (1957)\, Patsy Cline (1960)\, Glen Campbell (1974)\, Charley Pride (1973)\, and LeAnn Rimes (1999)\, have all recorded their own renditions of the song. Floyd Cramer's rock-and-roll cover crossed over to pop audiences in 1962\, while Frank Ifield took the song to #1 in the United Kingdom in 1963. In the 1970s\, Jerry Lee Lewis\, Little Richard\, Arlo Guthrie\, Don McLean\, Etta James and Linda Ronstadt all covered the song. George Strait took his cover all the way to #24 on the country chart in 1992 with little traditional promotion of the single. Alt-country artist Ryan Adams recorded the song for Timeless\, a Hank Williams tribute album. COL channel name VAL RPMmanToledo Ohio	0

COL title VAL Road Runner COL performer VAL Defenders	COL video title VAL Willie Dixon - Back door man COL description VAL "Back Door Man" is a blues song written by Willie Dixon for Howlin' Wolf\, released by Chess Records as a B-side to Wolf's "Wang Dang Doodle" in 1961. The song's author Willie Dixon recorded it on his 1970 album I Am The Blues.  In southern culture\, the phrase "back-door man" refers to a man having an affair with a married woman\, using the back door as an exit before the husband comes home. The phrase "back-door man" dates from the 1920s\, but the term became a double entendre in the 1960s\, also meaning "one who practices anal intercourse."  The song became an early standard cover song of The Doors and they recorded it for their 1967 debut album.

COL title VAL Red Hot COL performer VAL Robert Gordon with Link Wray	COL video title VAL ABBEY LINCOLN little Niles (1958) COL description VAL Album : it's magic Tune written by Jon Hendricks / Randy Weston  Because Abbey Lincoln has always been careful to sing songs that have a deep meaning for her\, all of her recordings through the years are memorable in their own way; there are no duds in her discography. Her second Riverside session (and her third recording)\, It's Magic has been reissued on this CD in the Original Jazz Classics series. The backup musicians are among the best in jazz at the time (Kenny Dorham or Art Farmer on trumpet\, trombonist Curtis Fuller\, Benny Golson on tenor\, Jerome Richardson or Sahib Shihab on reeds\, pianist Wynton Kelly\, Paul Chambers or Sam Jones on bass\, and drummer Philly Joe Jones) and they have opportunities to play short solos. Lincoln is heard at her early best on such numbers as "I Am in Love\," "An Occasional Man\," "Out of the Past" and Randy Weston's "Little Niles." Recommended. COL channel name VAL OubaelPhoumet	0

Through The Royal Scots Greys\, whose predecessors were raised by King Charles II in 1678\, the regiment can claim to be the oldest surviving Cavalry of the Line in The British Army. The Pipes and Drums of the current regiment have their origin in the small pipe band that came to the Royal Scots Greys in 1946. They have performed around the world and released many successful albums\, while also undertaking military assignments in service to the Queen. All members of The Pipes and Drums are fully trained tank-crew members. They were deployed as part of the 7th Armored Brigade during the Gulf War. COL channel name VAL Steve Thrasher	1

Their use of vocalese melded well with the song's swaying\, ballad-like melody.    Volare (to fly)\, or "Nel blu\, dipinto di blu" (In the blue\, painted blue)\, was originally recorded by Italian singer-songwriter Domenico Modugno. It was written by Franco Migliacci and Modugno and was released as a single February 1st\, 1958.  Since then\, the song has been covered and recorded by over 100 artists\, most notably by Dean Martin\, whose version reached the number two spot on the UK Singles Chart\, and peaked at fifteen on the Billboard Top 100.  Although not as popular on the charts\, The Kirby Stone Four's version of Volare remains a favourite in TheVinylDen. COL channel name VAL TheVinylDen	0

COL title VAL Black Is the Colour COL performer VAL Brian McFadden feat. Sinead O'Connor	COL video title VAL François Glorieux plays The Beatles - 07 - Yellow submarine (Beethoven) COL description VAL Improvisation on "Yellow submarine" in the style of Ludwig Beethoven. La plus grande originalité de cet étonnant LP réside sans doute dans le fait que chaque pièce a été entièrement improvisée. En d'autres termes : jouée spontanément sans préparation\, ni partition. Si François Glorieux est le seul pianiste de notre XXè siècle à s'être aventuré aussi loin dans le domaine de l'improvisation\, il ne révèle ici qu'UN des des multiples aspects de ce "grand art" qu'il pratique comme personne : l'improvisation de style. Et cela tient du miracle! Loin de se contenter d'un "pastiche à la manière de ..."\, il nous démontre comment les noms illustres de l'histoire de la musique auraient pu traiter les admirables mélodies des Beatles. Certains thèmes ont été reproduits intégralement\, d'autres ont été légèrement modifiés ou adaptés à l'image même du compositeur! Et on chercherait en vain un défaut de style ou de construction\, une faute de goût\, une lacune. Comme le disait si bien un critique musical allemand : " François Glorieux est en quelque sorte le faux-monnayeur de l'improvisation\, car c'est si parfait\, si réussi\, qu'on ne sait s'il joue le vrai ou le faux."

COL title VAL The Letter COL performer VAL Dr. B and The Interns	COL video title VAL Marc Cohn sings The Letter from his new album Listening Booth\, 1970 COL description VAL Listening Booth:1970 represents a continuation of a creative resurgence for Cohn\, ultimately brought on by one of the strangest and scariest events of his life. In 2005\, while driving back to his hotel with his band and tour manager after a show in Denver\, Cohn was shot in the head by a would - be carjacker. Although the bullet had to be removed from his left temple\, it miraculously missed penetrating his skull by a centimeter\, causing no physical damage and allowing him to be released from the hospital the next day. After working through a bout with post-traumatic stress syndrome\, Cohn has been busier than ever. Ending a nearly ten-year absence from the studio\, he released one of his most critically acclaimed records\, Join The Parade\, in 2007 and followed it with well over 150 shows across the country. "I had always had my priorities straight when it came to my family. For me\, it never felt right bringing children into the world and then spending all your time in a studio or a tour bus. But that night in Denver somehow brought me a new appreciation for my work and my audience."    Now\, Listening Booth:1970 ultimately brings Cohn back to where he began-- writing songs like 'Walking In Memphis' which spoke so eloquently about the transformative\, healing power of music. Like that hit single\, Listening Booth: 1970 is really the soundtrack to his life. As Cohn reflects\, "It seemed like such a natural progression for me to do a record like this because\, if you've been following my records from my first single\, I have been paying tribute to musicians through my writing all along\, from Al Green to Elvis to Levon Helm to Charlie Christian\, It's really been a touchstone for me. Now I'm just repaying a debt of gratitude to the artists who've changed my life and taught me how to do what I do." COL channel name VAL TheGigante	1

COL title VAL Soldier's Joy COL performer VAL Jerry Reed	COL video title VAL Howard Roberts_All The Things You Are COL description VAL Personnel: Howard Roberts (guitar); Bill Holman (tenor saxophone); Pete Jolly (piano); Red Mitchell (bass guitar); Stan Levy (drums); Marty Paich.  West Coast guitarist Howard Roberts was something of an unsung hero of that area's jazz scene. Though his bop-influenced style of cool jazz was tremendously influential\, Roberts himself was content to spend the bulk of his career working mainly on the Los Angeles session circuit\, where one of his numerous recordings was the eerie theme to THE TWILIGHT ZONE. 1959's GOOD PICKIN'S is an early Roberts effort that finds him performing both original "head" arrangements and bop and pop standards like "Relaxin' At Camarillo" and "All the Things You Are." Demonstrating a fluid\, creative style\, as well as an obvious affinity for Charlie Parker\, Roberts moves easily from the bebop stylings of "Will You Still Be Mine" to the bluesy "Lover Man\," aided by the sympathetic accompaniment of his band\, which includes his longtime colleague\, pianist Pete Jolly\, and legendary bop drummer Stan Levey.

Peace be unto her..... - Originally uploaded in my previous channel (65Reasons) on June 16\, 2008. It is being re-uploaded with some updates... - "The Way of Love" Composer: Jacques Dieval English Lyrics: Al Stillman   The lyricist for the French version "J'ai le mal de toi" is Michel Rivegauche.  The song was originally written in French under the name 'J'ai le mal de toi' and recorded by Lili Castel for the song competition "Musik Ohne Grenzen" on the Belgian radio (BRT).   The French lyrics were written by Michel Rivgauche.   In 1965\, it was released as a single by Kathy Kirby in English. Curiously\, while this single failed to chart in her native United Kingdom\, where Kirby placed several singles on the charts in the mid-60's\, it became her only song to place on Billboard Hot 100. The song's lyrics were penned from a male point of view. Kirby's rendition does not change the perspective\, creating a story in which the subject to whom she sings has left her for a male.  "The Way of Love" was later recorded by Cher. Her version hit number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 in February 1972.   - Enjoy! - COL channel name VAL 65Seasons	0

I own a copy of an old 'Now That's What I Call Music Video' VHS from the 1980s\, which I bought purely for this clip. As far as I am aware\, this is the only 'official' release of the video on VHS or DVD formatt. I have fixed the colour\, made the video a little sharper\, and I used the CD audio of the song to remaster the video's audio which was in mono and very muddy.  This video is a gem\, and as a huge Tina fan\, an excellent find. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I do. COL channel name VAL beyoncesmaw	0

COL title VAL Do I Love You COL performer VAL Salena Jones	COL video title VAL Maggie Bell - Wishing Well COL description VAL Suicide Sal - 1975  The success of Angel Air's series of Maggie Bell reissues can be easily judged by the Scottish singer's return to the U.K. after residing for years abroad\, a planned autobiography\, and her intention of touring. Although critically feted in the U.K.\, Bell\, both solo and with her former band Stone the Crows\, never quite achieved the commercial breakthrough everyone had so expected. Always a bridesmaid\, never a bride\, Bell's recording career was punctuated by a sole Stone the Crows charting album. With that band's demise in 1973\, the soul singer went solo\, releasing the (again) critically acclaimed Queen of the Night album\, with 1975's Suicide Sal following. A tougher\, more energized set than its predecessor\, Sal's electrifying live feel reflects the incendiary stage shows Bell and her new backing band had been playing in the intervening time between recordings. The two bonus tracks\, recorded at a gig later that year\, capture their live ferocity. Intriguingly\, the funky\, fiery title track\, an homage to Bell's Aunt\, a music hall star\, is one of only two originals on this set. The second\, the lavishly bluesy "If You Don't Know" was penned by band keyboardist Pete Wingfield\, and boasts a guesting Jimmy Page on guitar. The storming "Coming on Strong" also has a Bell connection\, being co-penned by ex-Crow Colin Allen and Zoot Money. The rest of the album comprises astutely chosen covers drawn from an eclectic selection of artists. One of the standouts is "It's Been So Long\," a powerful gospel number written by the Pretty Things' Phil May\, who not only rewrote some of the lyrics for Bell\, but added his backing vocals to the song. Free's classic "Wishing Well" gets a sensational workout\, while that band's offshoot Kossoff\, Kirke\, Tetsu & Rabbit's "Hold On" is taken to new emotive heights. From barrelling Beatles pop to the Sutherland Brothers poignant Gaelic ode\, from ballads to hefty rock & roll\, Bell struts across this set with style and such assurance\, that even Aunt Sal must have been impressed. One of Britain's greatest soul singers\, showcased at her best\, this magnificent album also includes an excellent\, expansive biography of this crucial artist.

Though he got his start in radio\, Allen is best-known for his television career. He first gained national attention as a guest host on Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts. He graduated to become the first host of The Tonight Show\, where he was instrumental in innovating the concept of the television talk show. Thereafter\, he hosted numerous game and variety shows\, including The Steve Allen Show\, I've Got a Secret\, The New Steve Allen Show\, and was a regular panel member on CBS' What's My Line?  Allen was a "creditable" pianist\, and a prolific composer\, having penned over 14\,000 songs\, one of which was recorded by Perry Como and Margaret Whiting\, others by Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme\, Les Brown\, and Gloria Lynne. Allen won a Grammy award in 1963 for best jazz composition\, with his song The Gravy Waltz. His vast number of songs have never been equaled\, however; singer/songwriter Julian Barry is said to have written over 5000 compositions. Allen wrote more than 50 books and has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.~~ COL channel name VAL MrMaymac	1

COL title VAL Steal Away COL performer VAL Billy Joe Royal	COL video title VAL Maggie Bell - Wishing Well COL description VAL Suicide Sal - 1975  The success of Angel Air's series of Maggie Bell reissues can be easily judged by the Scottish singer's return to the U.K. after residing for years abroad\, a planned autobiography\, and her intention of touring. Although critically feted in the U.K.\, Bell\, both solo and with her former band Stone the Crows\, never quite achieved the commercial breakthrough everyone had so expected. Always a bridesmaid\, never a bride\, Bell's recording career was punctuated by a sole Stone the Crows charting album. With that band's demise in 1973\, the soul singer went solo\, releasing the (again) critically acclaimed Queen of the Night album\, with 1975's Suicide Sal following. A tougher\, more energized set than its predecessor\, Sal's electrifying live feel reflects the incendiary stage shows Bell and her new backing band had been playing in the intervening time between recordings. The two bonus tracks\, recorded at a gig later that year\, capture their live ferocity. Intriguingly\, the funky\, fiery title track\, an homage to Bell's Aunt\, a music hall star\, is one of only two originals on this set. The second\, the lavishly bluesy "If You Don't Know" was penned by band keyboardist Pete Wingfield\, and boasts a guesting Jimmy Page on guitar. The storming "Coming on Strong" also has a Bell connection\, being co-penned by ex-Crow Colin Allen and Zoot Money. The rest of the album comprises astutely chosen covers drawn from an eclectic selection of artists. One of the standouts is "It's Been So Long\," a powerful gospel number written by the Pretty Things' Phil May\, who not only rewrote some of the lyrics for Bell\, but added his backing vocals to the song. Free's classic "Wishing Well" gets a sensational workout\, while that band's offshoot Kossoff\, Kirke\, Tetsu & Rabbit's "Hold On" is taken to new emotive heights. From barrelling Beatles pop to the Sutherland Brothers poignant Gaelic ode\, from ballads to hefty rock & roll\, Bell struts across this set with style and such assurance\, that even Aunt Sal must have been impressed. One of Britain's greatest soul singers\, showcased at her best\, this magnificent album also includes an excellent\, expansive biography of this crucial artist.

COL title VAL One for My Baby (And One More for the Road) COL performer VAL Toots Thielemans with Jamie Cullum	COL video title VAL John Prine and Mac Wiseman -  Where the Blue Of The Night (2007) COL description VAL Composed by\, Fred E. Ahlert / Bing Crosby / Roy Turk From the Oh Boy! Records album - Standard Songs For Average People (2007) sound recording administered by:  IODA REVIEW: The title tells the story well enough on Standard Songs for Average People\, a set of 14 country-leaning classics interpreted by venerable singer/songwriter John Prine and bluegrass balladeer Mac Wiseman. While Prine has never possessed a classically strong voice\, he knows how to communicate a lyric well enough (even lyrics he didn't write himself)\, and it's clear that he loves the songs he's selected for this project (Prine also co-produced with David Ferguson). Whatever Prine may lack in vocal polish\, Wiseman easily brings to the table; if his voice is a bit sandier than it was years ago\, he can still make the weepers sound convincingly sad and the uptempo numbers bring a smile when he's singing. The arrangements and production recall the smooth but homey sound of Nashville's countrypolitan era\, and the pickers bring the songs across with a simple but impressive aplomb (especially Tom O'Brien on guitar and banjo and Joey Miskulin on accordion). And the songs...well\, certain songs become standards because they're so good almost no one can go wrong with them\, and on this set "I Love You Because\," "The Blue Side of Lonesome\," "Saginaw\, Michigan\," and "Old Rugged Cross" sound fresh and engaging\, even though you've probably heard them hundreds of time before. And while they may not be as well-known\, Tom T. Hall's "Old Dogs\, Children and Watermelon Wine\," Kris Kristofferson's "Just the Other Side of Nowhere\," and Bob Wills' "Don't Be Ashamed of Your Age" sure sound like classics coming from Prine and Wiseman. The craft is strong on Standard Songs for Average People\, but at its heart it sounds like two friends singing some old songs they love on a quiet evening\, and that's part of the album's strength -- these are 14 songs sung by two guys who know a great tune when they hear it\, and they allow these numbers to work their magic simply\, which serves them very well.

Él nació en Glasgow\, Kentucky\, donde su padre era un barbero que amó la música e inspiró a Billy y le enseñó  tocar la mandolina a la edad de 3 años cuando padecía  un caso de la sarampión. Él continuó aprendiendo varios otros instrumentos.  En 1941 Vaughn se afilió a la Guardia Nacional de los Estados Unidos para lo que había sido preparado como una cesión de un año\, pero cuando la Segunda Guerra Mundial estalló\, le enviaron al extranjero hasta el final la guerra  en 1945.  Él decidió hacer de la música su carrera cuando él fue licenciado del ejército al final de guerra\, y asistió al Colegio de Estado de Kentucky Occidental\, ahora conocido como la Universidad de Kentucky Occidental.  Mientras él estaba un estudiante allí\, otros tres compañeros\, Jimmy Sacca\, Donald McGuire\, y Seymour Spiegelman\, que habían formado un trío vocal\, el Hilltoppers\, reclutaron a Vaughn para tocar el piano con ellos. Él pronto añadió su voz \, convirtiendo el trío en un cuarteto. Como  miembro del grupo\, él también escribió su primera canción \, Tentativa\, que charted en 1952.  En 1954 dejó el grupo para afiliarse a Archivos de Punto en Gallatin\, Tennessee como el director de música. Posteriormente formó su propia orquesta\, y tuvo un gran éxito en aquel mismo año "con la Melodía del Amor." Continuó cosechando éxitos  durante la próxima década y media. Vaughn murió del cáncer en Palomar\, California el 26 de septiembre\, { El 26 de septiembre} 1991.

On the critically acclaimed 52nd Street\, Fields convincingly demonstrates an unforgettable tableau of 11 wonderful songs from the jazz\, pop\, blues\, and Brazilian jazz genres in which the listener can delight. Accompanied by an array of jazz stars\, including Jeff Lorber\, this is simply a superb recording due to Fields' flawless vocals\, poetic imagination\, and soulful phrasings on such songs as "Maria\," "And I Love Her" featuring Gerald Albright\, the smooth jazz rendition of "A Night in Tunisia" featuring Chris Botti\, and "Open Your Heart" featuring the Oakland Interfaith Youth Gospel Choir. Victor Fields has marvelously timed his lyrics to compliment the breathtaking manner of saxophonist Albright and trumpeter Botti with his masterful tenor range and tells two exceptionally well-told musical stories that are filled with colorful nuance\, imaginative shadings\, and sensual scattings. Fields and Claudia Villela brilliantly transform Toots Thielemans' "Bluesette" into a Brazilian samba that is both lyrical and buoyant. With 52nd Street\, Victor Fields' sensuous\, sexy\, but sunny vocals have put many jazz vocalists in the shade. Top pick: "Five-Two Blues" featuring John R. Burr. COL channel name VAL dc grooves	1

On the critically acclaimed 52nd Street\, Fields convincingly demonstrates an unforgettable tableau of 11 wonderful songs from the jazz\, pop\, blues\, and Brazilian jazz genres in which the listener can delight. Accompanied by an array of jazz stars\, including Jeff Lorber\, this is simply a superb recording due to Fields' flawless vocals\, poetic imagination\, and soulful phrasings on such songs as "Maria\," "And I Love Her" featuring Gerald Albright\, the smooth jazz rendition of "A Night in Tunisia" featuring Chris Botti\, and "Open Your Heart" featuring the Oakland Interfaith Youth Gospel Choir. Victor Fields has marvelously timed his lyrics to compliment the breathtaking manner of saxophonist Albright and trumpeter Botti with his masterful tenor range and tells two exceptionally well-told musical stories that are filled with colorful nuance\, imaginative shadings\, and sensual scattings. Fields and Claudia Villela brilliantly transform Toots Thielemans' "Bluesette" into a Brazilian samba that is both lyrical and buoyant. With 52nd Street\, Victor Fields' sensuous\, sexy\, but sunny vocals have put many jazz vocalists in the shade. Top pick: "Five-Two Blues" featuring John R. Burr. COL channel name VAL dc grooves	1

Through The Royal Scots Greys\, whose predecessors were raised by King Charles II in 1678\, the regiment can claim to be the oldest surviving Cavalry of the Line in The British Army.

In search of an updated sound\, she also met with Mickie Most who was the hot producer at the time. They chose "Is It True?" as the A-side of a single and Brenda picked "What'd I Say" as the B-side. She wanted to be the first female to cover Ray Charles controversial 1959 hit. "Is It True?" was top twenty on both sides of the Atlantic and earned a Gold Record. "What'd I Say" was a minor hit in some countries. Meanwhile\, in the United States\, the marketing geniuses at the evil record company decided to replace "What'd I Say" with "Just Behind The Rainbow" for the US release. Apparently\, Brenda Lee was Little Miss Adult Contemporary to them and nothing so raw as this track could be allowed. As a result\, "What'd I Say" was never released in the States.  Track Info Recorded at the Decca #2 Studios at 165 Broadhurst Gardens\, West Hampstead\, North London on 17 August 1964 and the demos went out to the radio stations the very next day on 18 Aug 1964. Brenda made 11 promotional appearances for the single.  "Is It True?" entered British charts the week of 9/16/64.  Personnel: Arthur Greenslade (1923 –2003) (piano)\, Jimmy Page(1944-  ) later of Led Zeppelin (guitar)\, Big Jim Sullivan (1941 - 2012)  (guitar); Bobby Graham (1940 -- 2009) (drums)\, Alan Weighell (1922 –2002) (bass)\, Stan Barrett (percussion); Terry Johnson (sound engineer)\, Reg Guest (1930- arranger)\, Mickie Most (born Michael Hayes 1938 -- 2003) (producer).  Bobby Graham recalled the session: "Some acts stood out\, either because they put so much into the recordings. ....... Brenda Lee really did perform. Mickie Most produced that record ('Is It True') at Decca\, they wanted this English sound. John Carter and Kenny Lewis wrote the song\, and also did backing vocals. Jimmy Page and Jim Sullivan were on guitar\, Alan Weighell was on bass\, Stan Barrett on percussion and myself on drums.The arranger was Reg Guest. For the B side\, 'What I'd Say'. we were messing around\, somebody started the lick\, Brenda jumped in and Mickie Most said 'let's record that'. It was done in one take". Note: Graham is mistaken about 'What I'd Say' being a spur of the moment decision. Brenda herself says she wanted to do it and I can't imagine they would go into the session without a "B" side.   Availability UK Import album - Ace CHCHD-1222 "The Queen Of Rock 'N' Roll"  Released 2009  German Import album - Bear Family BFB10025 "Brenda Lee Rocks" Released June 14\, 2011  A session anecdote: Mickie Most recalled that Brenda Lee was late getting to the studio. It turned out that the car sent to pick her up had broken down. Mickie worried that time was short for the usual amount of takes. His fears were allayed when Brenda arrived and ran through "Is It True?". Most told the NME reporter "it sounded like she had been singing it all her life!".  At three years old\, Brenda Mae Tarpley needed to hear a song only once or twice in order to sing it back in perfect pitch and rhythm. This is according to her mother and older sister. Of course\, the Nashville session players had grown used to this extraordinary facility and it was common for them to lay down four to six tracks in one 3 Hr session. When she recorded outside of Nashville\, producers were always amazed at how few tries were needed for a Brenda Lee recording.  SG Barnard recollection:  I was lucky enough to be in the recording studio when Mickie Most produced this song for her. Jimmy Page's guitar sounds good as ever. Mickie insisted that the whole company joined in the choruses for 'What'd I Say'. Such amazing times! RIP Mickie\, industry genius.  NB: SG Barnard was Brenda's Press Officer in the UK. She posted on another YouTube video: "She [Brenda] was the most professional act I ever worked with".

Oh\, how the ghost of you clings  These foolish things remind me of you   The scent of smouldering leaves the wail of steamers  Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers  Oh how the ghost of you clings  These foolish things  Remind me of you   How strange\, how sweet\, to find you still  These things are dear to me  They seem to bring you so near to me   The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations  Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations  Oh how the ghost of you clings  These foolish things  Remind me of you  Remind me of you  Remind me of you COL channel name VAL annie2907	0
COL title VAL She's Got a Way COL performer VAL Jordan Knight	COL video title VAL The Holly and the Ivy COL description VAL “The Holly and the Ivy”\, this distinctive\, ancient\, British carol is heard on Allison Crowe’s new Christmas collection\, “Souling”.  http://music.allisoncrowe.com/album/souling  Allison Crowe’s gorgeous voice brings tidings of comfort and joy with “Souling” – her 11th full album release.  The artist\, one of our greatest living musicians\, singer-songwriters and performers\, has always created authentic music.  With this newest song set her voice is heard wholly a cappella.  The songs themselves have a purity of expression – a 21st century take on music of faith and spirit – sounds and themes aired by carollers and soulers of old.  The genesis of “Souling” is found in the bond Allison Crowe’s formed with the creative family at Theatre Newfoundland and Labrador. Founded in 1979\, this professional theatre company presents a dynamic and diverse repertoire of plays and maintains\, as well\, a strong commitment to youth theatre in the Atlantic Canada community.  For these past three Summers TNL’s engaged Crowe as Musical Director of “Newfoundland Vinyl” - a perennial favourite at the annual Gros Morne Theatre Festival. Following another hit season at GMTF\, in late August of this year TNL Artistic Associate SaraH McDonald invited the Corner Brook\, NL-based musician to serve the same role with a vibrant production of “A Christmas Carol”.  The Adaptation of this classic Charles Dickens story by playwright Jeff Pitcher\, TNL’s Artistic Director\, excited Crowe’s musical imagination – as did the desire of McDonald\, the play’s Director\, to incorporate songs in the style of Victorian Era carollers.  So inspired\, Allison Crowe immersed herself in curating the music for the abundantly-talented\, multi-aged\, choir of singers who performed in “A Christmas Carol” at the Corner Brook Arts and Culture Centre from November 27th – 30th\, 2014.  This artistic process of selection and arrangement led to her recording solo versions of those songs that will receive another distinct breath of life from the TNL vocal ensemble.  (In parallel fashion\, the first season’s run of “Newfoundland Vinyl” brought forth Allison Crowe’s album of the same name – one of 2013’s top recordings. Culture blog Muruch praised it as a “lovely\, vintage collection of traditional Irish and Canadian folk ballads\, lively sea chanteys and drinking songs\, parlour songs and country tunes” possessing “unique charm” and “the timeless beauty of a classic folk album”.)  In 2003\, (and expanded in 2004)\, Allison Crowe released Tidings – an album of singular interpretations - “River” (Joni Mitchell)\, “Hallelujah” (Leonard Cohen)\, “In My Life” (The Beatles) and more from the secular canon – alongside such favourite traditional carols as “Silent Night”\, “The First Noel”\, and “O Holy Night”. Tidings has proven to be a modern classic – “music for the season and all time”.  This time out\, as befits TNL’s telling of “A Christmas Carol”\, Allison Crowe gives pure voice to the sacred songbook. “Souling” is:  Soul Cake I Saw Three Ships That Night in Bethlehem (Don Oíche úd i mBeithil) God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen The Wexford Carol The Holly and the Ivy In the Bleak Midwinter (Cranham) Ding Dong Merrily on High Once in Royal David’s City Wassail Song  “Souling” is available now via Allison Crowe’s own website @ http://music.allisoncrowe.com/album/souling as well as on iTunes @ https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/souling/id933188580 plus CD Baby @ http://cdbaby.com/cd/allisoncrowe10 and all major digital music outlets worldwide.

COL title VAL I Love How You Love Me COL performer VAL Paul & Barry Ryan	COL video title VAL Square Set - Something you've got COL description VAL South African band formed in March 1966 (as per Derek Marks himself) by:  1. Nol Klinkhamer (keyboards) 2. Neville Whitmill (vocals) 3. Keith Moffat (drums) 4. Derek Marks (bass)  In August 1966\, this line-up recorded the 7” single “Silence Is Golden”\, as well as the album with the same title. Ian Martin was the recording sound engineer and Mike Noble was in a band called “The Hi Five” with Neville Whitmill long before The Square Set was formed\, but neither Ian or Mike were ever members of The Square Set\, as certain sources suggest.  In 1967 Keith was replaced by Don Robertson on drums\, and three months later Malcolm Postlethwaite in turn replaced Don. Don recorded “Carol Corina” with The Square Set in 1967\, while Malcolm recorded the follow-up Album “Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever' early in 1968. The remaining members remained the same throughout the years\, up until The Square Set split in August 1968.  When “That's What I Want” suddenly became popular 4 years later\, Nol and Neville reformed the band (late 1971)\, but Derek Marks didn't want to re-join\, therefore they employed Johnny Boshoff and Tony Moore to complete the third album “Those Many Feelings”. Mike Faure on sax joined the band on stage for about 3 months in 1968\, while Mercia Love was in the band from July 1967 to February 1968.  The Square Set had two South African Top 20 hits: 1. Carol Corina – 1967\, #15\, 5 weeks 2. Silence is golden – 1967\, #3\, 13 weeks  Neville Whitmiil also had two South African Top 20 hits as a solo artist: 1. Get me some help – 1971\, #2\, 18 weeks 2. Harmony – 1973\, #18\, 3 weeks   This song is off the album "Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever"\, released in 1968. It's a cover of a Chris Kenner song from 1961. COL channel name VAL keurspel (Leon Rossouw)	0

Det var sol och sommar över gröna hagar när som artonåring jag därhemma var. Och de minnen som står kvar från dessa dagar är de bästa och de vackraste jag har.  Ifrån landet uti väster tanken glider hem till kära gamla Sverige då och då. Fast det nu har svunnit många\, långa tider barndomshemmet har jag aldrig glömt ändå.  Jag är gammal och nu lever jag på minnet av mitt hem och mina vackra drömmars land. Vad som fordom bruka fängsla barnasinnet står så tydligt för min inre syn ibland. Uti hemmet fick jag allt vad jag begärde jag förstod det kanske ej förr’n jag blev stor. Och föräldrarna mig livets goda lärde. Nu de äro borta både far och mor.  Ifrån landet uti väster tanken glider hem till kära gamla Sverige då och då. Fast det nu har svunnit många\, långa tider barndomshemmet har jag aldrig glömt ändå. COL channel name VAL Lennart Ljung	1

Erskine Butterfield formed his piano-show case band in 1938 and slowly built a reputation on the East Coast. During their tour of the mid West\, the band signed on for radio staff work before gaining the attention of Decca Records.  Erskine was a good jazz pianist\, in later years Decca discovered his unique singing abilities\, and recorded additional songs highlighting those talents. The Decca songs that featured his singing include\, "Salt Butter\," "Missouri Waltz\," and "Blackberry Jam." His bands light swing and traditional piano phrases lead to a few standard band hits that occasional appear on movie soundtracks\, such as\, "Lovin' Man\," and "Because Of You."  During the 1950's he remained active in the studio with a number of album releases as well as TV appearances on The Nat King Cole Show\, The Tony Martin Program and The Jo Stafford Show.

Noone's playing is lyrical and sophisticated\, and certainly makes more use of "sweet" flavoring. Noone was an important influence on later clarinetists such as Artie Shaw and Benny Goodman. He started playing guitar in his home town and at the age of 15\, he switched to the clarinet and moved to New Orleans. He studied with Lorenzo Tio and with the young Sidney Bechet\, who was only 13 at the time. By 1912\, he was playing professionally with Kid Ory\, Papa Celestin\, the Eagle Band before joining the Original Creole Orchestra in Chicago in 1917. The following year\, he joined King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band\, then in 1926\, he started leading the band at Chicago's Apex Club\, the Jimmie Noone's Apex Club Orchestra\, in which the influential pianist Earl Hines was playing for a time. In  1943 he moved to Los Angeles\, where he died suddenly of a heart attack. The Kid Ory's band played for him the blues titled "Blues for Jimmie" on the radio\, and the number eventually became a regular feature for the Ory band. COL channel name VAL 240252	0

COL title VAL How's the World Treating You COL performer VAL Molly Bee	COL video title VAL Delaney and Bonnie - "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'" (Genesis LP) COL description VAL by Delaney & Bonnie. From the "Genesis" LP  For an album that is clearly a compilation of older material meant to capitalize on the fame from Delaney & Bonnie's 1971 hits on Atco\, The "Genesis" LP is a true find! There are only three tracks from the duo\, all produced by Leon Russell; the nine other titles are Delaney Bramlett solo\, six produced by Jackie DeShannon\, three others with no producer credited. Despite the slight deception -- that this is a Delaney Bramlett album with three bonus tracks by the hit group -- the disc still works on its own. DeShannon has Delaney sounding like Gene Pitney on "Tomorrow Never Comes\," while "Heartbreak Hotel" and Ray Charles' "I Got a Woman" have him emulating Elvis. On the uncredited production of "Lonely Me\," Mr. Bramlett goes for an early John Lennon vocal style\, then veers off to Gerry and the Pacemakers territory on his originals\, "Without Your Love" and "Better Man Than Me\," quite revealing in that they are so different from the music Jimmy Miller produced for the group when Delaney & Bonnie on Tour With Eric Clapton emerged. Jackie DeShannon's pop production kicks in again with "Liverpool Lou\," and it is back to that Gene Pitney sound. COL channel name VAL BobSeger1981	0

COL title VAL How's the World Treating You COL performer VAL Molly Bee	COL video title VAL Leslie West - Tequila.wmv COL description VAL Leslie West - As Phat As It Gets (1999) He's half the man he used to be in terms of mass\, but when it comes to rock & roll\, just stand back and listen as the master holds court. The man who once recorded an album called The Great Fatsby is back\, slimmed down and kicking as hard as ever on tracks like "Palace of the King" and "Allergic." West comes out jamming\, backed by some pretty familiar names from the lexicon of classic rock\, including Joe Lynn Turner\, Kim Simmonds of Savoy Brown\, Popa Chubby\, and a little band called the Destroyers\, who take time away from their day job playing with a fella named George Thorogood. When West rips into the old blues standard "Stormy Monday\," it's take-no-prisoners electric blues\, and his covers of "Tequila" and Otis Redding's "Respect" are Mountain-ized. (Speaking of "Respect\," it's a little-known fact that West's first group\, the Vagrants\, had a version of that very same song out on a single in 1969 that was meant to be their key to the big time\, but when Atco issued Aretha Franklin's now-legendary version\, the Vagrants' record was blasted into obscurity.) "Raw Nerve" rocks with a real Billy Gibbons influence\, and "The Cell" is an infectious life-in-prison tune that's meant to be played loud. Actually\, the whole album sounds best with the volume knob set at 11. Oh\, and if you're looking for blues\, there's a ripsnorter penned by Leon Russell called "Me and My Guitar." "As Phat as It Gets" mixes the best elements of Frank Zappa\, Black Sabbath\, and Mountain into one smoldering tune about weight loss.  Tracklist  1. Saturation (I'm In Love With You)   (03:23) 2.

McDowell was born in Rossville\, Tennessee\, near Memphis. His parents\, who were farmers\, died when McDowell was a youth. He started playing guitar at the age of 14 and played at dances around Rossville. Wanting a change from plowing fields\, he moved to Memphis in 1926 where he worked in a number of jobs and played music for tips. He settled in Como\, Mississippi\, about 40 miles south of Memphis\, in 1940 or 1941\, and worked steadily as a farmer\, continuing to perform music at dances and picnics. Initially he played slide guitar  using a pocket knife and then a slide made from a beef rib bone\, later switching to a glass slide for its clearer sound. He played with the slide on his ring finger.[4]  While commonly lumped together with Delta Blues singers\, McDowell actually may be considered the first of the bluesmen from the 'North Mississippi' region - parallel to\, but somewhat east of the Delta region - to achieve widespread recognition for his work. A version of the state's signature musical form somewhat closer in structure to its African roots (often eschewing the chord change for the hypnotic effect of the droning\, single chord vamp)\, the North Mississippi style (or at least its aesthetic) may be heard to have been carried on in the music of such figures as Junior Kimbrough and R. L. Burnside\, while serving as the original impetus behind creation of the Fat Possum record label out of Oxford\, Mississippi.[citation needed]  The 1950s brought a rising interest in blues music and folk music in the United States and McDowell was brought to wider public attention\, beginning when he was discovered and recorded in 1959 by Alan Lomax and Shirley Collins.[5] McDowell's records were popular\, and he performed often at festivals and clubs.[6] McDowell continued to perform blues in the North Mississippi blues style much as he had for decades\, but he sometimes performed on electric guitar rather than acoustic guitar. While he famously declared "I do not play no rock and roll\," McDowell was not averse to associating with many younger rock musicians: He coached Bonnie Raitt on slide guitar technique\,[6] and was reportedly flattered by The Rolling Stones' rather straightforward\, authentic version of his "You Gotta Move" on their 1971 Sticky Fingers album.  McDowell's 1969 album I Do Not Play No Rock 'N' Roll was his first featuring electric guitar. It features parts of an interview in which he discusses the origins of the blues and the nature of love. (This interview was sampled and mixed into a song\, also titled "I Do Not Play No Rock 'N' Roll" by Dangerman in 1999.) McDowell's final album[7]\, Live in New York (Oblivion Records)\, was a concert performance from November 1971 at the Village Gaslight (aka The Gaslight Cafe)\, Greenwich Village\, New York.  McDowell died of cancer in 1972\, aged 68\, and was buried at Hammond Hill Baptist Church\, between Como and Senatobia\, Mississippi. On August 6\, 1993 a memorial was placed on his grave site by the Mt. Zion Memorial Fund. The ceremony was presided over by Dick Waterman\, and the memorial with McDowell's portrait upon it was paid for by Bonnie Raitt. The memorial stone was a replacement for an inaccurate and damaged marker (McDowell's name was misspelled) and the original stone was subsequently donated by McDowell's family to the Delta Blues Museum in Clarksdale\, Mississippi.

COL title VAL A Hard Day's Night COL performer VAL Johnny Rivers	COL video title VAL Delaney and Bonnie - "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'" (Genesis LP) COL description VAL by Delaney & Bonnie. From the "Genesis" LP  For an album that is clearly a compilation of older material meant to capitalize on the fame from Delaney & Bonnie's 1971 hits on Atco\, The "Genesis" LP is a true find! There are only three tracks from the duo\, all produced by Leon Russell; the nine other titles are Delaney Bramlett solo\, six produced by Jackie DeShannon\, three others with no producer credited. Despite the slight deception -- that this is a Delaney Bramlett album with three bonus tracks by the hit group -- the disc still works on its own. DeShannon has Delaney sounding like Gene Pitney on "Tomorrow Never Comes\," while "Heartbreak Hotel" and Ray Charles' "I Got a Woman" have him emulating Elvis. On the uncredited production of "Lonely Me\," Mr. Bramlett goes for an early John Lennon vocal style\, then veers off to Gerry and the Pacemakers territory on his originals\, "Without Your Love" and "Better Man Than Me\," quite revealing in that they are so different from the music Jimmy Miller produced for the group when Delaney & Bonnie on Tour With Eric Clapton emerged. Jackie DeShannon's pop production kicks in again with "Liverpool Lou\," and it is back to that Gene Pitney sound. COL channel name VAL BobSeger1981	0

TESTO DELLA CANZONE E BIOGRAFIA DELL'INTERPRETE  TESTO: Tornerai / da me perché l'unico sogno sei / del mio cuor. Tornerai / tu perché senza i tuoi baci languidi / non vivrò. Ho qui dentro ognor la tua voce che dice / tremando "amor". Tornerò / perché tuo è il mio cuor.  Tu sai che t'amo: / non ho che te mi stai lontano: / dimmi perché? La nostalgia / non senti in cuor? Non ti ricordi di me? Questa mia vita / non può durar\, tu sei fuggita / devi tornar: questo mio cuor / ti vuole ancor.  Tornerò / perché tuo è il mio cuor.  BIOGRAFIA (da ildiscobolo.net)  Si chiamava il realtà Guido Di Luca ed era nato a Livorno nel 1903. Dopo una attivissima carriera radiofonica (fu tra l'altro in radio uno dei tre moschettieri nella celebre rubrica degli anni '30) e discografica che lo videro incidere decine di 78 giri  prevalentemente per la Parlophon quando questa etichetta era in Italia prodotta e distribuita dalla Cetra.   Emigrò negli anni cinquanta negli Stati Uniti \, ove continuò a lavorare come attore\, spesso affiancato da nomi molto noti dello spettacolo americano. Morì \, proprio negli USA nel 1991.   Fu tra l'altro il marito della nota attrice Lilla Brignone\, scomparsa nel 1984\, conosciuta proprio alla radio durante la lavorazione di una delle tante commedie radiofoniche ale quali partecipò.   Molte le incisioni da lui realizzate affiancato dal Trio delle sorelle Lescano : Balliamo il passo Lambeth Bimba mia non mi resistere Casetta mia Disillusione Giovanotti Girotondo dell'amore Il maestro innamorato La ragazza del giornale Ladro d'amore Son tutte belle Un anno di baci Un po' di sole Una ninna-nanna COL channel name VAL Melodieantiche	0

Marlena Shaw	COL video title VAL Ferrante & Teicher -- S Wonderful COL description VAL Ferrante & Teicher eran un dúo de pianistas americanos\, conocidos por sus arreglos de piezas clásicas\, bandas sonoras de películas\, y todo tipo de ritmos. Arthur Ferrante  (7 de septiembre de 1921\, Nueva York - 19 de septiembre de 2009)\, y Louis Teicher (24 de agosto de 1924\, Wilkes-Barre\, Pennsylvania  - 3 de agosto de 2008) se conocieron mientras estudiaban en la Escuela Juilliard de Música de Nueva York. Niños prodigios de la música\, que comenzaron  a actuar como dúo de piano cuando aún estaban en la escuela.  En 1947\, comenzaron a dedicarse por completo al mundo de la música y rápidamente empiezan a ascender  tocando música clásica con respaldo orquestal. Steven Tyler de Aerosmith relata la historia de que en la década de 1950\, los dos estudiantes ensayaban en la casa de su abuela Constanza Neidhart Tallarico.  Entre 1950 y 1980\, fueron un importante dúo de música  easy listening\, consiguiendo  cuatro grandes EE.UU. golpea:  El tema de  "The Apartment" \, el Tema  de "Exodus  \, "Tonight" y "Cowboy de medianoche". Realizaron actuaciones y grabaciones de forma regular con las orquestas de George Gershwin \, Jerome Kern \, Cole Porter \, Richard Rodgers y otros  Ferrante: https://itunes.apple.com/es/album/space-age-pop-1958/id833688918  Síguenos en: Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/vintagem.es Spotify: http://open.spotify.com/user/vintagemusic Web: http://www.vintagemusic.es BoutiqAlia: http://boutiqalia.com/store/vintage/ (compra física de CD) Compra nuestros Cd's en formato físico en estas plataformas: Ebay:  http://stores.ebay.com/VintageMusicFm BoutiqAlia: www.boutiqalia-vintagemusic.com Síguenos en: Spotify: https://goo.gl/raouHQ Facebook: https://goo.gl/L92BHL Instagram: https://goo.gl/3oYDGH Web: http://www.vintagemusic.es   Compra nuestros Cd's en formato físico en estas plataformas: Ebay:  http://stores.ebay.com/VintageMusicFm BoutiqAlia: www.boutiqalia-vintagemusic.com Discogs: https://www.discogs.com/es/seller/vintagemusicfm/profile COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm	0

Jim Hall and Joe Pass had somewhat of a professional rivalry throughout the 70's-early 80's\, often trading places atop Down Beat Magazine's annual Best Of poll. Although they are stylistically very different\, there are many overlaps in their bodies of work\, which makes for an interesting comparison/contrast.

Noone's playing is lyrical and sophisticated\, and certainly makes more use of "sweet" flavoring. Noone was an important influence on later clarinetists such as Artie Shaw and Benny Goodman. He started playing guitar in his home town and at the age of 15\, he switched to the clarinet and moved to New Orleans. He studied with Lorenzo Tio and with the young Sidney Bechet\, who was only 13 at the time. By 1912\, he was playing professionally with Kid Ory\, Papa Celestin\, the Eagle Band before joining the Original Creole Orchestra in Chicago in 1917. The following year\, he joined King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band\, then in 1926\, he started leading the band at Chicago's Apex Club\, the Jimmie Noone's Apex Club Orchestra\, in which the influential pianist Earl Hines was playing for a time. In  1943 he moved to Los Angeles\, where he died suddenly of a heart attack. The Kid Ory's band played for him the blues titled "Blues for Jimmie" on the radio\, and the number eventually became a regular feature for the Ory band. COL channel name VAL 240252	0
COL title VAL You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To COL performer VAL Cheryl Bentyne	COL video title VAL The Charlie Daniels Band - Old Chisholm Trail.wmv COL description VAL By the Light of the Moon - Campfire Songs (1997) In the 1970s\, fiddler Charlie Daniels was one of the few almost completely country-leaning artists to make a play on the mainstream rock market. He did splendidly for a while\, and the production values he learned playing in rock-inflected settings show clearly on his first kids recording. By the Light of the Moon is most surely a country recording\, but it has all the driving rhythmic energy of an elegantly mastered rock album. The drums sound fat and still crisp\, the guitars bright. Daniels's voice\, especially during the interludes where he speaks about the music\, reveals a timeworn huskiness that will charm kids looking for a cowboy to sing to them. The songs emphasize the old\, with "John Henry" and "I'm an Old Cowhand" standing out. The latter includes Daniels playing short fiddle solos that cut a nice\, fresh path through the tune. A sonically splashy session indeed\, By the Light of the Moon has enough old-timey vibrance to merit a spot in any roots-oriented kids collection.  Song Title    1. Get Along\, Little Dogies 3:26  2.

There have been several covers of the song (including The Birds and Saint Etienne in English) but the most known is probably the 1996 cover recording by the French artist Mylène Farmer and the French-born musician Khaled. The Farmer/Khaled cover was performed during Farmer's 1996 concert tour. After three live performances\, the song was finally released as the first single from Farmer's second live album\, Live à Bercy on 29 April 1997\, and became a top five hit in Belgium.  Background and live performances  There is a studio version of this duet\, but it was never released. This studio version was performed in lip-sync in a single television show\, Tip top\, broadcast on a French channel and host by Éric Jean-Jean\, where Farmer was invited to promote her single "Comme j'ai mal". Previously\, the show proposed to Farmer a list of singers with whom she would sing a song. She chose Khaled and decided to perform a cover of Polnareff's song\, "La Poupée qui fait non"\, and the recording lasted four hours.  Interviewed by the French magazine Instant-Mag\, Thierry Rogen\, the sound engineer who has participated in the recording\, said: "I have participated in the single "La Poupée qui fait non" with Khaled. Laurant [Boutonnat] was absent. The recording was made in the studio Merga in Suresnes in the right mood. It has been very rapid. Mylène [Farmer] and Khaled were together for four hours in total".  Farmer said she chose the song because it was the first song she learned when she was a child\, and she loved Michel Polnareff's work. Khaled also said: "This is a common idea\, we wanted to sing together. We loved both Polnareff. Personally\, I think it's the first song I learned."  The live version\, which was released in 1997\, was performed only three nights (two in Geneva and the last at Bercy) as a duet on stage during the 1996 tour. This remained the only collaboration between two artists.  The two remixes available on the CD maxi and the promotional vinyl were produced by Mylène Farmer (this is the only time she has participated in remixes of one of her singles)\, in collaboration with Thierry Rogen. However\, these remixes have not been well appreciated by the singer's fans\, because almost all the words have disappeared.  When the song was released\, Khaled declared that he found Farmer very sympathetic.[8] However\, later\, he said he had felt used by her\, since she put herself forward all the time when they performed the song and were interviewed; according to a 2009 edition of Nouvel Observateur\, Khaled qualified this collaboration as a "trap".  Critical reception  The song generally received negative reviews. According to the author Erwan Chuberre\, the duo Khaled / Farmer "which blends the sun and the darkness is on the limit of credibility". "The two worlds [of both singers] really failed to merge and this cover is soon forgotten!" Instant-Mag considered as "absurd" the fact that the studio version was never released\, and found that the song "was much harmed by the remixes that accompany it\, in which we have as the hazy impression that Mylène was amused herself (and without supervision) to press the buttons on the console of Thierry Rogen".  In France\, the single debuted at a peak of number six on 3 May 1997. However\, like Farmer's previous top ten hits\, it dropped rather quickly and fell off the top 50 after eight weeks.  Surprisingly\, the song was a big success in Belgium\, where it had a better chart trajectory in the Ultratop 40 than in France. It appeared on the chart for a total of 18 weeks from 24 May 1997\, peaked at number five on 21 June\, and managed to remain for eight weeks in the top ten. The song ranked at number 41 in the End of year chart. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

It was written about Jane Asher\, McCartney's girlfriend of five years\, "You don't look different\, but you have changed\," the lyrics declare\, reflecting his dissatisfaction with their relationship.  The Beatles recorded three versions of the song in October and November 1965. The original version recorded on 24 October was slower than the released version\, had a significantly different rhythm\, and lacked the "Why\, tell me why..." middle eight of the final version.  It was eventually released in 1996 on the Anthology 2 compilation.  The final version was recorded on 10 November with overdubs on 11 November and is the version included on Rubber Soul.      * Paul McCartney -- double-tracked vocal\, acoustic rhythm guitar\, bass\, lead guitar     * John Lennon -- harmony vocal\, acoustic rhythm guitar     * George Harrison -- guitar     * Ringo Starr -- drums\, tambourine\, Hammond organ  In other news\, I have added the lyrics to this song so you can sing along\, or perhaps learn the song!

While its instrumental version is simply known as "The Godfather Love Theme"\, "Speak Softly Love" is the vocal version. The words are by Larry Kusik but the music itself is by Nino Rota. The signature musical theme that opens the piece closely models a theme that appears early in "Preludio - Povero Ernesto!" in the opera Don Pasquale by Gaetano Donizetti (1797-1848). A similar melody also appears in the Overture to "La Forza del Destino" by Giuseppe Verdi (1813-1901). There are also different sets of lyrics for the song in Italian ("Parla Più Piano") and also in Sicilian ("Brucia La Terra"). The Sicilian version is sung by Anthony Corleone (Franc D'Ambrosio) in The Godfather Part III.  Rota had used a more comedic version of the song for the 1958 film Fortunella. When this was discovered\, Rota's score for The Godfather was disqualified from consideration at the 1973 Academy Awards; it had been nominated for Best Original Score. However\, Rota's score for The Godfather Part II won the 1974 Academy Award for Best Original Score\, despite containing the same piece.  Recordings  The song was originally recorded by Andy Williams. Other artists\, such as Al Martino\, Eric Clapton and Bobby Vinton\, have also recorded the song\, among many others:  Slash regularly performs it in concerts in a rock style. Ken Boothe recorded a reggae version. Sergio Franchi recorded the theme song his 1976 DynaHouse album 20 Magnificent Songs. Satan's Pilgrims have performed a surf version as well. Harry Connick Jr. recorded it under the title "Parle Plus Bas". Gianni Morandi had covered the song under the title "Parla Più Piano". Dalida\, Tino Rossi\, Marie Laforêt\, and the Puppini Sisters covered the song under the title "Parle Plus Bas". A Ukrainian version\, "Say You Love Me" (Ukrainian: Скажи\, що любиш; Skazhy scho lyubysh) was performed by Sofia Rotaru in the musical film Song Is Always with Us. The Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra has also performed a ska version of the song. The song was also sampled for a song\, "Raja ko rani se pyar ho gaya" in the Indian film Akele Hum Akele Tum. In Yugoslavia it was adapted and sung by Tereza Kesovija as "Govori Tiše". Hungarian pop star György Korda released the Hungarian language version 1974 as "Gyöngéden ölelj át és ringass szerelem". Candies performed this song live in Osaka in 1977. Fantômas also recorded a metal version of the song on their album The Director's Cut. The Hot Club of Detroit recorded a Gypsy jazz cover of this song on their eponymous album. The Sicilian version from The Godfather Part III appears on the music compilation Mob Hits: the Best Songs of Mafia Movies. Speak Softly Love\, recorded in 2004 by the Norwegian singer Rein Alexander. The melody was used as the theme music and as a central plot device in the Soviet short animated film Contact. A Slovak version was done by František Krištof Veselý\, and a Czech version by Jiří Malásek. Scott Walker recorded a version for his 1972 album The Moviegoer. A Portuguese version called "Fale Baixinho" was recorded by Brazilian singer Wanderley Cardoso in 1972. German jazz pianist Wolfgang Liebert regularly performs it as a standard. Hip-hop artist RZA of Wu-Tang Clan samples the theme in "Black Mozart" on Raekwon's album Only Built 4 Cuban Linx II. The Italian version ("Parla Piu Piano"\, or "Io e Te") was recorded by Johnny Dorelli in 1973 . Dominic Chianese\, who portrayed Johnny Ola in The Godfather Part II\, recorded the Italian version for his album Ungrateful Heart. Mac Dre sampled the theme in his hip-hop song "Mafioso" from his 2003 album\, Al Boo Boo. Parle Plus Bas\, recorded in 2008 by French singer Patrick Fiori for his album Les Choses de La Vie. Rosenberg Trio recorded a version of this song on their 1992 album\, Impressions. The song was covered by several Hong Kong singers\, Frances Yip (葉麗儀) in 1972\, Irene Ryder (黎愛蓮) in 1973\, Juliana Luok (陸小雅) on her LP album Killing Me Softly\, and also\, by Singaporean singer Ling Ying (林櫻) on her LP album The Best Of Lin Ying & The Prinstar Punchers in 1972.

COL title VAL I'm the Hoochie Kooche Man COL performer VAL Dion Di Muci	COL video title VAL Ferrante & Teicher - Scarborough Fair (4/12) COL description VAL Ferrante & Teicher were a duo of American piano players\, known for their light arrangements of familiar classical pieces\, movie soundtracks\, and show tunes.  Scarborough Fair Trad. arr. Ferrante & Teicher  United Artists 6725  Arthur Ferrante (September 7\, 1921\, New York City -- September 19\, 2009)\, and Louis Teicher (August 24\, 1924\, Wilkes-Barre\, Pennsylvania -- August 3\, 2008) met while studying at the Juilliard School of Music in New York. Musical prodigies\, they began performing as a piano duo while still in school. After graduating\, they both joined the Juilliard faculty.  Steven Tyler of Aerosmith relates the story that in the 1950's the two students practiced in the home of his grandmother Constance Neidhart Tallarico.  In 1947\, they launched a full-time concert career\, at first playing nightclubs\, then quickly moving up to playing classical music with orchestral backing. Between 1950 and 1980\, they were a major American easy listening act\, and scored four big U.S. hits: "Theme From The Apartment" (Pop #10)\, "Theme From Exodus" (Pop #2)\, "Tonight" (Pop #8)\, and "Midnight Cowboy" (Pop #10). They performed and recorded regularly with pops orchestras popular standards by George Gershwin\, Jerome Kern\, Cole Porter\, Richard Rodgers and others. In 1973\, they did the Hollywood Radio Theater theme for the Rod Serling radio drama series\, The Zero Hour.  The duo also experimented with prepared pianos\, adding paper\, sticks\, rubber\, wood blocks\, metal bars\, chains\, glass\, mallets\, and other found objects to piano string beds. In this way they were able to produce a variety of bizarre sounds that sometimes resembled percussion instruments\, and at other times resulted in special effects that sounded as if they were electronically synthesized.  Both men were initiated as honorary members of Tau Kappa Epsilon at Central State University (now University of Central Oklahoma) while on tour.  Ferrante and Teicher ceased performing in 1989 and retired to Longboat Key and Siesta Key\, respectively\, both close to each other on the west coast of Florida. They continued to play together occasionally at a local piano store.  CDs of their music\, some of it not previously released\, have continued to appear.  Louis Teicher died in 2008\, three weeks before his 84th birthday. Arthur Ferrante died on September 19\, 2009 at 88 (he had once said he wanted to live one year for each piano key). Arthur is survived by his wife\, Jena; his daughter\, Brenda Eberhardt; and two granddaughters. COL channel name VAL MultiUriahheep	0

COL title VAL Le bleu de l'été COL performer VAL Les Alcarson	COL video title VAL 'Round Midnight - Bettye LaVette COL description VAL This song is from an EP that was a digital-only release by Anti- Records. I have placed the song here to try to bring more attention to the release. It seems that many are unaware of it's existence. Support the artist and get the download from Itunes\, Amazon\, etc.  Bettye LaVette - vocals  Alan Hill - piano  John Heard: Bass  Danny Frankel: percussion  Tom Hagerman: strings & string arrangements   Produced & mixed by Rob Schnapf  Recorded at Sonara Recorders  Mastered by Mark Chalecki at Little Red Book Mastering   Song writing credits:  Change Is Gonna Come - Sam Cooke   Round Midnight - Thelonious Monk   God Bless The Child - Billie Holiday / Arthur Herzog   Lush Life - Billy Strayhorn   Ain't No Sunshine - Bill Withers   Ain't That Lovin' You - Jimmy Reed  Official Press Release  Having conquered the ghosts of a hard-luck past on her GRAMMY-nominated CD The Scene of the Crime\, BETTYE LAVETTE shines a new light on that past with her latest\, A CHANGE IS GONNA COME SESSIONS. The digital-only EP for Anti- Records\, available exclusively through iTunes starting June 16\, revisits BETTYE's forgotten post-Atlantic Records years as a nightclub singer\, Broadway performer\, and touring cast member opposite Cab Calloway in "Bubbling Brown Sugar."    The EP opens with a stirring solo version of Sam Cooke's posthumous Civil Rights anthem "A Change Is Gonna Come\," a song which BETTYE sang with Jon Bon Jovi in January as part of the "We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial" concert. Joining BETTYE for these Sessions are pianist and musical director Al Hill\, veteran bassist John Heard -- who has accompanied such luminaries as Count Basie\, Cole Porter\, Ella Fitzgerald\, and Art Pepper -- drummer Danny Frankel (k.d. lang\, Lou Reed)\, and Tom Hagerman from DeVotchKa on strings.    A mix of standards and soul classics from BETTYE's 1970s stage and nightclub repertoire rounds out the 6-song set\, including songs by Thelonious Monk\, Duke Ellington\, Bill Withers\, and Jimmy Reed. A rendition of Billie Holiday's "God Bless The Child" -- a song that BETTYE first performed with show-stopping magnificence in "Bubbling Brown Sugar" -- highlights BETTYE's vocal mastery. Rather than attack\, BETTYE approaches these tracks with subtlety -- while nonetheless wresting every ounce and every nuance of meaning from the words she sings. Once more\, BETTYE provides the definitive answer to the question posed by NPR in its review of The Scene of the Crime: "Is there any soul singer who brings more guts\, more conviction and more emotion to her singing?" Absolutely not. COL channel name VAL imnokid	0

COPYRIGHTS RESERVED BY COPYRIGHT OWNER.This video is used only for non-profit usage and publishing. Gerard de Vries (Hilversum\, 19 augustus 1933) is een Nederlands zanger en diskjockey.Gerard de Vries is vooral bekend om zijn parlando-muziek\, waarin hij in de jaren zestig van de 20e eeuw enkele grote hits scoorde. Bekende hits van hem zijn Het spel kaarten uit 1965 en Giddy up go uit 1966. Veel van zijn nummers hebben het leven als vrachtwagenchauffeur  als onderwerp. Onder meer Giddy up go en Teddybeer zijn hier voorbeelden van. Vaak zijn deze nummers vertalingen van de populaire Amerikaanse zanger Red Sovine. Opvallend is dat de vertaalde nummers van De Vries niet rijmen\, terwijl die van Sovine dat wel doen. De hits over het leven als vrachtwagenchauffeur zijn in de regel verhalend. De nummers van De Vries hebben vaak een moraliserende ondertoon.Radio Veronica-medewerkers en diskjockeys Ad Bouman\, Hans Mondt\, Tom Collins\, Gerard de Vries en Klaas Vaak namen begin 1970 onder de naam De Binkies de carnavalshit  "Met carnaval" op. Het reikt niet verder dan de Tipparade.Naast zanger was Gerard de Vries diskjockey. Hij presenteerde aanvankelijk bij Radio Veronica onder het pseudoniem  Cowboy Gerard en later bij de TROS onder eigen naam. Gerard de Vries baarde opzien door als eerste diskjockey openlijk voor zijn homoseksualiteit uit te komen. In 1972 praatte hij over Les Cranes Engelse tekst heen op diens single "Desiderata". Het werd de B-kant van de in Nederland uitgebrachte single. Op dit moment is Gerard de Vries actief bij de lokale omroep in Wijdemeren\, Radio Wijdemeren.Na zijn carrière als zanger en diskjockey werd Gerard de Vries ondernemer in de paranormale branche.In 2007 was De Vries kort te zien in het 'datingspektakel' van (de Nederlandse versie van) het televisieprogramma Man bijt hond; hij had gereageerd op een oproep van kandidaat 'Gijs'\, die een man zocht. De Vries bood Gijs een zelfgeschreven boekje aan met de titel De Nederlandse taal. COL channel name VAL top401965	0

Det var sol och sommar över gröna hagar när som artonåring jag därhemma var. Och de minnen som står kvar från dessa dagar är de bästa och de vackraste jag har.

Jag är gammal och nu lever jag på minnet av mitt hem och mina vackra drömmars land. Vad som fordom bruka fängsla barnasinnet står så tydligt för min inre syn ibland. Uti hemmet fick jag allt vad jag begärde jag förstod det kanske ej förr’n jag blev stor. Och föräldrarna mig livets goda lärde. Nu de äro borta både far och mor.

He did splendidly for a while\, and the production values he learned playing in rock-inflected settings show clearly on his first kids recording. By the Light of the Moon is most surely a country recording\, but it has all the driving rhythmic energy of an elegantly mastered rock album. The drums sound fat and still crisp\, the guitars bright. Daniels's voice\, especially during the interludes where he speaks about the music\, reveals a timeworn huskiness that will charm kids looking for a cowboy to sing to them. The songs emphasize the old\, with "John Henry" and "I'm an Old Cowhand" standing out. The latter includes Daniels playing short fiddle solos that cut a nice\, fresh path through the tune. A sonically splashy session indeed\, By the Light of the Moon has enough old-timey vibrance to merit a spot in any roots-oriented kids collection.  Song Title    1. Get Along\, Little Dogies 3:26  2.

When it became clear that Allen was the best singer in the new group\, he became the front man\, and Frank Cook\, previously of Canned Heat\, came into the band on drums. Originally known as the Pacific Gas and Electric Blues Band\, they shortened their name when they signed to Kent Records\, releasing the album Get It On in early 1968. The record was not a success\, but following the band's performance at the Miami Pop Festival in May 1968 they were signed by Columbia Records.[1][2] Their first album for Columbia\, Pacific Gas and Electric\, was issued in 1969\, but they achieved greater success with their next album\, Are You Ready in 1970. The title track reached # 14 on the Billboard Hot 100.[3] After the album was recorded\, Cook was injured in a car accident and was replaced on drums by Ron Woods\, Cook staying on as manager. Marshall and Schwartz left\, and were replaced by Frank Petricca (bass) and Ken Utterback (guitar)\, with Brent Block moving to rhythm guitar before leaving later in 1970. Unusually for the time\, the band contained both black and white musicians\, which led to rioting and gunfire on one occasion when the band\, who toured widely\, performed in Raleigh\, North Carolina.[1] In 1971\, the band changed their name to PG&E\, following pressure from the utility company of the same name. The band also expanded\, Allen\, Woods\, Petricca and Utterback being joined by Jerry Aiello (keyboards)\, Stanley Abernathy (trumpet)\, Alfred Galagos and Virgil Gonsalves (saxophones)\, and Joe Lala (percussion). They recorded the album PG&E\, and also appeared in and provided music for the Otto Preminger film Tell Me That You Love Me\, Junie Moon starring Liza Minnelli. The band then split up. A final album using the name\, Pacific Gas & Electric Starring Charlie Allen\, was recorded by Allen with studio musicians and released on the Dunhill label in 1973.[1][2] For a time the group also included Rick Durrett formerly of the band The Coven on keyboards.[citation needed] Tom Marshall later suffered deteriorating health and personal circumstances\, being homeless since the 1980s.[4] Frank Petricca became a commodity broker.[5] Charlie Allen died in 1990\, aged 48.[6]  Past members Charlie Allen Tom Marshall (1967--70) Brent Block (1967--70) Glenn Schwartz (1967--70) Frank Cook (1967--70) Ron Woods (1970--72) Frank Petricca (1970--72) Ken Utterback (1970--72) Jerry Aiello (1971--72) Stanley Abernathy (1971--72) Alfred Galagos (1971--72) Virgil Gonsalves (1971--72) Joe Lala (1971--72) COL channel name VAL ozzyserbia	0

TESTO DELLA CANZONE E BIOGRAFIA DELL'INTERPRETE  TESTO: Tornerai / da me perché l'unico sogno sei / del mio cuor. Tornerai / tu perché senza i tuoi baci languidi / non vivrò. Ho qui dentro ognor la tua voce che dice / tremando "amor". Tornerò / perché tuo è il mio cuor.  Tu sai che t'amo: / non ho che te mi stai lontano: / dimmi perché? La nostalgia / non senti in cuor? Non ti ricordi di me? Questa mia vita / non può durar\, tu sei fuggita / devi tornar: questo mio cuor / ti vuole ancor.  Tornerò / perché tuo è il mio cuor.

Noel\, Noel\, Noel\, Noel Born is the King of Israel!  They looked up and saw a star Shining in the East beyond them far And to the earth it gave great light And so it continued both day and night. Noel\, Noel\, Noel\, Noel Born is the King of Israel!  And by the light of that same star Three Wise men came from country far To seek for a King was their intent And to follow the star wherever it went. Noel\, Noel\, Noel\, Noel Born is the King of Israel!  This star drew nigh to the northwest O'er Bethlehem it took it's rest And there it did both Pause and stay Right o'er the place where Jesus lay. Noel\, Noel\, Noel\, Noel Born is the King of Israel!  Then entered in those Wise men three Full reverently upon their knee And offered there in His presence Their gold and myrrh and frankincense. Noel\, Noel\, Noel\, Noel Born is the King of Israel!  Then let us all with one accord Sing praises to our heavenly Lord That hath made Heaven and earth of nought And with his blood mankind has bought.

From Wikipedia\, the free encyclopedia  Oh Well were a UK dance group that started in the late 1980s. They were relatively successful during their peak in 1989\, but broke up soon after\, due to lack of chart success thereafter.  The group had two UK chart singles in 1989 and 1990: the eponymous "Oh Well" single was released in late 1989 and peaked at number 28 on the UK Singles Chart for two weeks\, starting on October 28. Their second single\, a cover of Golden Earring's "Radar Love"\, was released in early 1990 and debuted and peaked at number 63 on March 3.  The band can be referred to as a "one hit wonder"\, seeing as how they only had one single reach the Top 40. "Oh Well" was featured on Now That's What I Call Music! 16\, the sixteenth volume of the popular British hits series. COL channel name VAL 3Life3	0

COL title VAL Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini COL performer VAL Lisa del Bo	COL video title VAL Leslie West - Tequila.wmv COL description VAL Leslie West - As Phat As It Gets (1999) He's half the man he used to be in terms of mass\, but when it comes to rock & roll\, just stand back and listen as the master holds court. The man who once recorded an album called The Great Fatsby is back\, slimmed down and kicking as hard as ever on tracks like "Palace of the King" and "Allergic." West comes out jamming\, backed by some pretty familiar names from the lexicon of classic rock\, including Joe Lynn Turner\, Kim Simmonds of Savoy Brown\, Popa Chubby\, and a little band called the Destroyers\, who take time away from their day job playing with a fella named George Thorogood. When West rips into the old blues standard "Stormy Monday\," it's take-no-prisoners electric blues\, and his covers of "Tequila" and Otis Redding's "Respect" are Mountain-ized. (Speaking of "Respect\," it's a little-known fact that West's first group\, the Vagrants\, had a version of that very same song out on a single in 1969 that was meant to be their key to the big time\, but when Atco issued Aretha Franklin's now-legendary version\, the Vagrants' record was blasted into obscurity.) "Raw Nerve" rocks with a real Billy Gibbons influence\, and "The Cell" is an infectious life-in-prison tune that's meant to be played loud. Actually\, the whole album sounds best with the volume knob set at 11. Oh\, and if you're looking for blues\, there's a ripsnorter penned by Leon Russell called "Me and My Guitar." "As Phat as It Gets" mixes the best elements of Frank Zappa\, Black Sabbath\, and Mountain into one smoldering tune about weight loss.  Tracklist  1. Saturation (I'm In Love With You)   (03:23) 2.

COL title VAL Falling Slowly COL performer VAL Simon Bailey & Sabrina Aloueche	COL video title VAL On The Sunny Side Of The Street - Coleman Hawkins (Savoy) HD COL description VAL Recorded in 1944.  Coleman Hawkins was the first great saxophonist of Jazz. As a child he was a gifted musician. In 1922\, Mamie Smith spotted him in Jesse Stone and his Blues Serenaders in Kansas City theatre and hired him away to play with her Jazz Hounds. Hawkins stayed with Smith until 1923\, and appeared on some of her records. After leaving The Jazz Hounds\, he played with Wilbur Sweatman and then made his first recordings with Fletcher Henderson. He joined Henderson's Orchestra in 1924 and stayed with him for the next ten years. In addition to his work with Henderson\, he recorded with McKinney's Cotton Pickers\, and with Red McKenzie's Mound City Blue Blowers in 1929. When he left Henderson in 1934 he moved to Europe\, and stayed there until 1939 playing first with Jack Hylton's Orchestra in England and then traveling and recording throughout the continent. In 1937 he appeared on a famous recording date with Benny Carter\, Django Reinhardt and Stéphane Grappelli. In 1939 as World War II started\, Hawkins wisely returned to America. He recorded a version of "Body and Soul" in 1940 that became his most famous record. Hawkins was one of the few Hot Jazz musicians who made the shift to Be Bop in the Forties. He hired Thelonious Monk for his quartet in 1944 and led an early bop recording session the same year which included Dizzy Gillespie. He also hired Miles Davis and Max Roach to play on his bands early in their careers. In 1946 he recorded with J.J. Johnson and Fats Navarro. By the early 1950s\, the innovations of Lester Young and Charlie Parker made Hawkins' style seem a bit old fashioned. However Hawkins was able to adapt to the changing currents in Jazz again\, when he teamed up with Roy Eldridge. Throughout the rest Fifties and Sixties he appeared on records made by Thelonious Monk\, Max Roach\, Eric Dolphy and John Coltrane. In the early 1960s Coleman Hawkins recorded with Duke Ellington\, and made a record with Sonny Rollins. COL channel name VAL althazarr's good time oldies	0

Noel\, Noel\, Noel\, Noel Born is the King of Israel!  They looked up and saw a star Shining in the East beyond them far And to the earth it gave great light And so it continued both day and night. Noel\, Noel\, Noel\, Noel Born is the King of Israel!  And by the light of that same star Three Wise men came from country far To seek for a King was their intent And to follow the star wherever it went. Noel\, Noel\, Noel\, Noel Born is the King of Israel!  This star drew nigh to the northwest O'er Bethlehem it took it's rest And there it did both Pause and stay Right o'er the place where Jesus lay. Noel\, Noel\, Noel\, Noel Born is the King of Israel!  Then entered in those Wise men three Full reverently upon their knee And offered there in His presence Their gold and myrrh and frankincense. Noel\, Noel\, Noel\, Noel Born is the King of Israel!  Then let us all with one accord Sing praises to our heavenly Lord That hath made Heaven and earth of nought And with his blood mankind has bought. Noel\, Noel\, Noel\, Noel Born is the King of Israel! COL channel name VAL lukshard	0

COL title VAL Je t'appartiens COL performer VAL Gilbert Bécaud	COL video title VAL The Sweet Inspirations - Let It Be Me COL description VAL Info: The Sweet Inspirations were an American R&B girl group mostly known for their work as backup singers on studio recordings for other R&B and rock artists. A founding member of the group was Dionne Warwick\, who was later replaced by her aunt\, Cissy Houston. The Sweet Inspirations was founded by former members of The Drinkard Singers\, a long-running Gospel singing group whose membership included Cissy Houston (née Drinkard\, and mother of Whitney Houston\, 1963) and Lee Warwick\, who was Cissy's sister and the mother of Sweet Inspirations members Dee Dee and Dionne Warwick). As a backup group\, the Sweet Inspirations were in high demand among producers\, publishers\, artists\, and songwriters in the early 1960s. The original lineup included Doris Troy and the two Warwick sisters Dionne & Dee Dee. Sylvia Shemwell (sister of Judy Clay) replaced Troy\, while Cissy Houston took over from Dionne\, with Dee Dee Warwick as the group's official leader. The group sang backup for many stars\, including Solomon Burke\, Aretha Franklin\, Wilson Pickett\, and Esther Phillips. Dee Dee left in 1965\, when her solo career began to take off. She was replaced by Myrna Smith. Estelle Brown joined the team soon after\, and the line-up that was to become an Atlantic recording group was set. The Sweet Inspirations recorded by themselves for the first time in April 1967 for Atlantic Records. That session produced the first two singles released by Atlantic\, a version of "Why (Am I Treated So Bad)\," a song previously recorded by The Staple Singers and a soulful version of "Let It Be Me"\, a French song which had been a pop and R&B hit for Betty Everett & Jerry Butler in 1964.

COL title VAL She's Fine\, She's Mine COL performer VAL Bo Diddley	COL video title VAL Ferrante & Teicher - Scarborough Fair (4/12) COL description VAL Ferrante & Teicher were a duo of American piano players\, known for their light arrangements of familiar classical pieces\, movie soundtracks\, and show tunes.  Scarborough Fair Trad. arr. Ferrante & Teicher  United Artists 6725  Arthur Ferrante (September 7\, 1921\, New York City -- September 19\, 2009)\, and Louis Teicher (August 24\, 1924\, Wilkes-Barre\, Pennsylvania -- August 3\, 2008) met while studying at the Juilliard School of Music in New York. Musical prodigies\, they began performing as a piano duo while still in school. After graduating\, they both joined the Juilliard faculty.  Steven Tyler of Aerosmith relates the story that in the 1950's the two students practiced in the home of his grandmother Constance Neidhart Tallarico.  In 1947\, they launched a full-time concert career\, at first playing nightclubs\, then quickly moving up to playing classical music with orchestral backing. Between 1950 and 1980\, they were a major American easy listening act\, and scored four big U.S. hits: "Theme From The Apartment" (Pop #10)\, "Theme From Exodus" (Pop #2)\, "Tonight" (Pop #8)\, and "Midnight Cowboy" (Pop #10). They performed and recorded regularly with pops orchestras popular standards by George Gershwin\, Jerome Kern\, Cole Porter\, Richard Rodgers and others. In 1973\, they did the Hollywood Radio Theater theme for the Rod Serling radio drama series\, The Zero Hour.  The duo also experimented with prepared pianos\, adding paper\, sticks\, rubber\, wood blocks\, metal bars\, chains\, glass\, mallets\, and other found objects to piano string beds. In this way they were able to produce a variety of bizarre sounds that sometimes resembled percussion instruments\, and at other times resulted in special effects that sounded as if they were electronically synthesized.  Both men were initiated as honorary members of Tau Kappa Epsilon at Central State University (now University of Central Oklahoma) while on tour.  Ferrante and Teicher ceased performing in 1989 and retired to Longboat Key and Siesta Key\, respectively\, both close to each other on the west coast of Florida. They continued to play together occasionally at a local piano store.  CDs of their music\, some of it not previously released\, have continued to appear.  Louis Teicher died in 2008\, three weeks before his 84th birthday. Arthur Ferrante died on September 19\, 2009 at 88 (he had once said he wanted to live one year for each piano key). Arthur is survived by his wife\, Jena; his daughter\, Brenda Eberhardt; and two granddaughters. COL channel name VAL MultiUriahheep	0

COL title VAL Iris COL performer VAL Alex Goot feat. Chad Sugg	COL video title VAL Carl Smith No One Will Ever Know COL description VAL Success in the 1950s  In 1951\, his song "Let's Live a Little" was a big hit\, reaching No. 2 on country chart. During 1951 he had up three other hits\, including "If the Teardrops Were Pennies" and his first No. 1 hit\, "Let Old Mother Nature Have Her Way".  The songs made Smith a well-known name in country music. His band\, the Tunesmiths\, featured steel guitarist Johnny Silbert\, who added an element of Western swing.   In 1952\, Smith married June Carter (who later became the wife of Johnny Cash)\, the daughter of Maybelle Carter of the Carter Family. In 1955 the couple had a daughter\, Rebecca Carlene Smith\, who later became known as Carlene Carter\, a country singer in her own right.  During the rest of the 1950s\, Smith made regular appearances on Billboard's country charts\, racking up many hits\, including 30 in the Top 10. His biggest hits include "Loose Talk"\, "Wicked Lies"\, "Hey Joe!" and "You Are the One". He had five No. 1 hits in his career; "Loose Talk" was his last\, in 1955. "Hey Joe!" got to Number 1 in the UK Singles Chart for Frankie Laine in October 1953 for two weeks.  Some of his songs had sharp edges\, fast phrasing and a strong drumbeat\, similar to rockabilly material making the charts in the mid-50s\, which in some ways made Smith's music closer to rock and roll than country. Some of his songs did\, however\, make the pop charts. His biggest pop entry was the song "Ten Thousand Drums" in 1959\, which reached No. 43 on the pop chart.  In 1956\, Smith quit the Grand Ole Opry. Soon after\, he joined The Phillip Morris Country Music Show and spent more than a year touring the United States\, often in direct competition with touring Opry shows. He also made regular appearances on ABC-TV's Jubilee USA and was a fill-in host for Red Foley.  In 1957\, Smith and June Carter divorced. That same year\, he appeared in the movie\, The Badge of Marshal Brennan and Buffalo Guns\, and married country music singer Goldie Hill\, best known for the No. 1 hit "I Let the Stars Get In My Eyes". Goldie retired from the music business. By the late 50s\, Smith's success began to dwindle on the country charts\, and soon his string of Top 10s turned into Top 20 hits.

COL title VAL I Fought the Law COL performer VAL Beatsteaks	COL video title VAL Maggie Bell - Wishing Well COL description VAL Suicide Sal - 1975  The success of Angel Air's series of Maggie Bell reissues can be easily judged by the Scottish singer's return to the U.K. after residing for years abroad\, a planned autobiography\, and her intention of touring. Although critically feted in the U.K.\, Bell\, both solo and with her former band Stone the Crows\, never quite achieved the commercial breakthrough everyone had so expected. Always a bridesmaid\, never a bride\, Bell's recording career was punctuated by a sole Stone the Crows charting album. With that band's demise in 1973\, the soul singer went solo\, releasing the (again) critically acclaimed Queen of the Night album\, with 1975's Suicide Sal following. A tougher\, more energized set than its predecessor\, Sal's electrifying live feel reflects the incendiary stage shows Bell and her new backing band had been playing in the intervening time between recordings. The two bonus tracks\, recorded at a gig later that year\, capture their live ferocity. Intriguingly\, the funky\, fiery title track\, an homage to Bell's Aunt\, a music hall star\, is one of only two originals on this set. The second\, the lavishly bluesy "If You Don't Know" was penned by band keyboardist Pete Wingfield\, and boasts a guesting Jimmy Page on guitar. The storming "Coming on Strong" also has a Bell connection\, being co-penned by ex-Crow Colin Allen and Zoot Money. The rest of the album comprises astutely chosen covers drawn from an eclectic selection of artists. One of the standouts is "It's Been So Long\," a powerful gospel number written by the Pretty Things' Phil May\, who not only rewrote some of the lyrics for Bell\, but added his backing vocals to the song. Free's classic "Wishing Well" gets a sensational workout\, while that band's offshoot Kossoff\, Kirke\, Tetsu & Rabbit's "Hold On" is taken to new emotive heights. From barrelling Beatles pop to the Sutherland Brothers poignant Gaelic ode\, from ballads to hefty rock & roll\, Bell struts across this set with style and such assurance\, that even Aunt Sal must have been impressed. One of Britain's greatest soul singers\, showcased at her best\, this magnificent album also includes an excellent\, expansive biography of this crucial artist.

It has become a pop standard and an even more popular country song since it helped make Hank Williams famous in the 1940s. Published through Tin Pan Alley in 1922\, the song was first recorded by the popular contralto Elsie Clark. Later that year\, it was recorded by Jack Shea (not the 1932 Olympic medalist speed skater) on Vocalion 14333. This recording contains a verse that no later versions include. Emmett Miller recorded it on Okeh 40465\, September 1\, 1925. He re-recorded it on June 12 1928\, accompanied by his Georgia Crackers (which included Tommy Dorsey\, Jimmy Dorsey\, Eddie Lang\, and Leo McConville). On November 26\, 1926\, blues singer Bertha "Chippie" Hill recorded a different song titled "Lovesick Blues" (Okeh 8453). The song was a minor hit for her. The first country music version of the song was by Rex Griffin (Decca 5570)\, September 25\, 1939. The song's most recognizable version did not come until 1948\, with Williams' hit rendition. Though Williams had scored a few hits prior to "Lovesick Blues\," the song was the first of many number one hits on Country radio for the singer. It also marked one of the songwriter's few cover songs. The song's monumental success led to Williams' tenure at the Grand Ole Opry and remains one of his best remembered songs. In 2004\, it was one of 50 recordings chosen that year by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry. His version of the song appeared in such films as The Last Picture Show (1971) and The Shawshank Redemption (1994). Since Williams' hit rendition of the song\, it has been covered by a wide array of performers. Country performers including Slim Whitman (1957)\, Patsy Cline (1960)\, Glen Campbell (1974)\, Charley Pride (1973)\, and LeAnn Rimes (1999)\, have all recorded their own renditions of the song. Floyd Cramer's rock-and-roll cover crossed over to pop audiences in 1962\, while Frank Ifield took the song to #1 in the United Kingdom in 1963. In the 1970s\, Jerry Lee Lewis\, Little Richard\, Arlo Guthrie\, Don McLean\, Etta James and Linda Ronstadt all covered the song. George Strait took his cover all the way to #24 on the country chart in 1992 with little traditional promotion of the single. Alt-country artist Ryan Adams recorded the song for Timeless\, a Hank Williams tribute album. COL channel name VAL RPMmanToledo Ohio	0

Gates Of Steel - Supernova 12. Freedom Of Choice - Lagwagon 13. Beautiful World - One Hit Wonder  ------------------------  "Whip It" is the title of a 1980 single by the American New Wave band Devo. It appears on the album Freedom of Choice. There were two 7" single releases of "Whip It"\, one backed with a remix of the track "Snowball" (which appears on Freedom of Choice) and one backed with "Turn Around" (a song later covered by Nirvana).  "Whip It" was Devo's biggest hit\, and peaked at number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart\, number three on the Canadian Singles Chart and number 77 on the Australian Singles Chart (Kent Music Report).  It is ranked #62 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of the '80s as well as #15 on the same channel's 100 Greatest One Hit Wonders of the '80s  Song information  "Whip It" is built on a motorik beat\, similar to tracks by Neu!. The lead instrument is a Minimoog synthesizer. The bass is performed with a custom six oscillator synthesizer\, custom made by Moog Music for Devo. The whip sound was made with an EML ElectroComp 500 synthesizer.  On an episode of the VH1 show TrueSpin\, Gerald V. Casale revealed that the lead guitar riff from "Whip It" is based on the riff from "Oh\, Pretty Woman" by Roy Orbison with the beat moved to the back.  Gerald Casale told Songfacts that the lyrics were written by him "as an imitation of Thomas Pynchon's parodies in his book Gravity's Rainbow." The lyrics evoke a working class desire to pull oneself up and to overcome adversity. The song has violent undertones\, and Devo has often described it as about Jimmy Carter\, as Mothersbaugh describes in an interview on To The Best of our Knowledge. However\, many people took the lyrics at face value\, interpreting the song as a paean to masturbation and sadomasochism\, or a reference to inhaling nitrous oxide from whipped cream cans (taken from the name "whip-it"\, used to describe the nitrous chargers for whipped cream dispensers).  "Whip It" debuted at a live concert on December 29th\, 1979 in Santa Cruz\, California. The first performance included a synthesizer solo taken from the early Devo song "Chango." This performance was recorded and is available as a bootleg. A demo version was recorded in 1980 and later released in 2000 on the compilation Recombo DNA released by Rhino Handmade.  Music video  Devo funded the music video for "Whip It" with $15\,000 USD of their own money. The main visual of the video\, Mark Mothersbaugh whipping the clothes off a woman\, was inspired by an article in a 1962 issue of "Dude" magazine. In an interview for Songfacts\, Casale explains "There was a feature article on a guy who had been an actor and fell on hard times\, he wasn't getting parts anymore. He moved with his wife to Arizona\, opened a dude ranch and charged people money to come hang out at the ranch. Every day at noon in the corral\, for entertainment\, he'd whip his wife's clothes off with a 12-foot bullwhip. She sewed the costumes and put them together with Velcro. The story was in the magazine about how good he was and how he never hurt her. We had such a big laugh about it\, we said\, 'OK\, that's the basis for the video. We'll have these cowboys drinking beer and cheering Mark on as he's in the barnyard whipping this pioneer woman's clothes off while the band plays in the corral.'"  In the video\, Devo wears black\, sleeveless turtlenecks\, and their famous Energy Dome headgear. When the video begins\, all the members\, except for Mark Mothersbaugh\, wear the turtlenecks pulled over their faces. During the performance\, each member lowers the turtleneck. Robert Mothersbaugh ("Bob 1") plays a Moog Liberation keytar\, Robert Casale ("Bob 2") plays a red Rheem Kee Bass\, and Alan Myers plays a set of Synare electronic drum pads.  Not surprisingly\, the S&M overtones of the video caused controversy. Devo was forced to abandon a television appearance after the host deemed the video offensive to women. Despite this\, "Whip It" received heavy rotation on MTV after its introduction in 1981. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

It was written about Jane Asher\, McCartney's girlfriend of five years\, "You don't look different\, but you have changed\," the lyrics declare\, reflecting his dissatisfaction with their relationship.  The Beatles recorded three versions of the song in October and November 1965. The original version recorded on 24 October was slower than the released version\, had a significantly different rhythm\, and lacked the "Why\, tell me why..." middle eight of the final version.  It was eventually released in 1996 on the Anthology 2 compilation.  The final version was recorded on 10 November with overdubs on 11 November and is the version included on Rubber Soul.      * Paul McCartney -- double-tracked vocal\, acoustic rhythm guitar\, bass\, lead guitar     * John Lennon -- harmony vocal\, acoustic rhythm guitar     * George Harrison -- guitar     * Ringo Starr -- drums\, tambourine\, Hammond organ  In other news\, I have added the lyrics to this song so you can sing along\, or perhaps learn the song!

COL title VAL You've Changed COL performer VAL Simone Waddell	COL video title VAL Oh Well - Oh Well COL description VAL No one knows who these guys are\, so I thought I'd post their songs. From Wikipedia\, the free encyclopedia  Oh Well were a UK dance group that started in the late 1980s. They were relatively successful during their peak in 1989\, but broke up soon after\, due to lack of chart success thereafter.  The group had two UK chart singles in 1989 and 1990: the eponymous "Oh Well" single was released in late 1989 and peaked at number 28 on the UK Singles Chart for two weeks\, starting on October 28. Their second single\, a cover of Golden Earring's "Radar Love"\, was released in early 1990 and debuted and peaked at number 63 on March 3.  The band can be referred to as a "one hit wonder"\, seeing as how they only had one single reach the Top 40. "Oh Well" was featured on Now That's What I Call Music! 16\, the sixteenth volume of the popular British hits series. COL channel name VAL 3Life3	0

TESTO DELLA CANZONE E BIOGRAFIA DELL'INTERPRETE  TESTO: Un bacio ti domando ma tu non dici quando. tu sempre mi rispondi: "chissa'\, chissa'\, chissa'..." ed ogni di' che passa\, cosi' mi fai soffrire\, perche' non fai che dire: "chissa'\, chissa'\, chissa'..." per te io mi tormento pensando\, pensando. aspetto che tu m'ami\, non so quando\, non so quando. ed ogni di' che passa così\, mi fai soffrire\, perche' non fai che dire: "chissa'\, chissa'\, chissa'..."

BIOGRAFIA (da Wikipedia): Entra all'EIAR vincendo il secondo concorso per voci nuove Gara nazionale per gli artisti della canzone\, indetto dall'ente radiofonico nel 1939\, esordendo nel 1940 insieme a Silvana Fioresi nell'orchestra Angelini e proseguendo poi in quelle di Pippo Barzizza\, Carlo Zeme e Beppe Mojetta. Allo stesso periodo risalgono le prime incisioni\, realizzate per la Cetra; nel 1947 incide le canzoni Abbasso le donne e La luna e sei soldi\, tratte dalle colonne sonore dei rispettivi omonimi film. Dotato di una voce baritonale lievemente rauca\, canta anche in orchestre di jazz\, esibendosi spesso con il noto chitarrista Michele Ortuso; il successo continua per tutto il decennio\, finché\, nel 1952 si trasferisce in Sudamerica a seguito di un ingaggio cinematografico; lì continua l'attività sino al periodo a cavallo tra gli anni settanta ed ottanta\, quando\, dopo essersi esibito ancora con successo per lungo tempo nei ritrovi più prestigiosi del Venezuela\, si ritira a Caracas. Nel 2006 il regista Pasquale Pozzessere ha inserito\, nella colonna sonora della miniserie televisiva La provinciale\, la canzone La ragazza del ritmo\, della quale Donà\, oltre che interprete\, è stato anche autore del testo e della musica. Tra i suoi motivi più famosi\, si ricordano: Venezia\, la luna e tu\, Buonanotte Brasil\, Bocca nel buio\, La danza dello scoiattolo\, Il tamburo della banda d'Affori (una delle sue canzoni più note\, scritta da Mario Panzeri)\, Serenata ad un angelo\, Ballerina\, Botta e risposta\, Suona balalaika e Tarantella d'amore.

They both possessed immediately identifiable sounds\, were veterans of Count Basie's Orchestra and never had any difficulty swinging. The repertoire of this Edison album is not too creative with five blues among its eight songs and one of the others\, "Feelings\," being quite forgettable. However\, the playing of the principals (along with pianist Dolo Coker who also makes a couple of surprising appearances on electric keyboard) holds one's interest throughout.

It has a twelve bar blues progression\, using only three chords until the coda.  In addition to Neal Hefti's original version\, and the television soundtrack version by Nelson Riddle\, versions were covered by The Marketts (single "Batman Theme" and album The Batman Theme by The Marketts)\, The Ventures (The Ventures Play the "Batman" Theme\, Dolton BST8042\, 3/1966)\, Al Hirt\, The Standells and actor/musician David McCallum.  The song has been widely parodied in the decades since its debut. The theme has been re-recorded by dozens of artists\, including Link Wray\, Voivod\, The Jam\, and The Who.  Adaptations  Jan & Dean on their 1966 album\, Jan And Dean Meet Batman. The Who recorded a cover of the theme in 1966.  The Kinks played a cover of the theme at their show at Kelvin Hall\, Glasgow\, in 1967. Adrian Henri and his band Liverpool Scene did a skit of the theme in the late 60s using Henri's poem Batpoem. The Jam covered the "Batman Theme" on their debut album\, In the City in 1977. In 1966\, an album called Batman and Robin: The Sensational Guitars of Dan and Dale was released featuring members of the Sun Ra Arkestra and The Blues Project. The opening track is a cover of the "Batman Theme". Prince and R.E.M. used variations of the TV show theme in their work: Prince in the song "Batdance" (which appeared on the soundtrack to Tim Burton's 1989 movie)\, and R.E.M. in a rejected song for the Batman Returns soundtrack\, later released under the title "Winged Mammal Theme"\, as a B-side to the single "Drive". Voivod did a cover on their 1988 Dimension Hatröss album. Disciplina kicme did a cover on their album Najlepši hitovi! Uživo (1987). John Zorn\, led off his Naked City album on YouTube with a version of Batman (1990). The Well Paid Scientists produced an acid techno remix entitled To The Batrave......Let's Go in 1998. According to Ritchie Blackmore\, the main riff in "Space Truckin'" by the English rock band Deep Purple is based on the "Batman Theme". Snoop Dogg sampled the Batman Theme for his song "Batman & Robin" on the album Paid tha Cost to Be da Boss (2002). COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0
COL title VAL I Gotta Right to Sing the Blues COL performer VAL Julie London	COL video title VAL GRANT LEE PHILLIPS love my way (2006) COL description VAL The Psycheledic Furs' cover  album ; Nineteeneighties   However\, rather than going for a spunky\, electric sound here that might match the style of the originals\, Phillips' arrangements are measured and atmospheric\, dominated by acoustic instruments and a gentle approach that blends nicely with the smooth\, bittersweet flow of his vocals. While this isn't the way you remember hearing these songs back in the day\, Phillips reaches into the material with an obvious love and respect\, and he finds a beautifully melancholy essence in these tunes that makes for a satisfying marriage of artist and material.

COL title VAL Let It Rock COL performer VAL John Oates	COL video title VAL Toy Factory - Summertime (1970) COL description VAL Banda: Toy Factory Album: ST (1970) Origem: Estados Unidos Gravadora: AVCO Embassy - AVLP 7014   Though we haven't been able to track down much bibliographical information on this late-60s bi-racial outfit\, we think they were from Long Island\, New York. From the liner notes on their LP we can also tell you Greg Weiss was the lead singer and was responsible for writing roughly half the material. The rest of the line up consisted of bassist Bill\, guitarist Billy\, drummer Joey and keyboard player Sal (great detail there). Produced by Bernie Lawrence\, the majority of 1970's "Toy Factory" found the band trying to fight their way through rather faceless MOR pop. Lead singer Greg Weiss had a decent voice\, but on tracks such as "What Is Youth"\, "To Live or Die" and "Honey\, Forever" he employed an irritating faux-English accent that recalled Davy Jones (he sounds like David Hemmings to me Bad Cat!!!). He also had an irritating habit of throwing mock sobs and groans into the mix ("When I'm with You" and "Honey Forever"). Strike three were the occasional French lyrics (don't pick on the French Bad Cat!!!) he tossed into the mix ("To Live or Die" and "Honey Forever"). Curiously\, the band was at their best when they cut loose and go for a harder rock sound. In this case\, the pseudo-psychedelic "No Rhyme To Orange" (sporting a nice fuzz guitar solo) and "Things" was a nifty slice of blue-eyed soul. "Summertime" also found the band turning in one of the weirdest George Gershwin covers we've ever heard (pretty decent guitar here too Bad Cat!!!). This one certainly won't change your life\, but it's one of those period failures that's worth checking out. (Tyme Machine Blog) COL channel name VAL Melomano Discos	0

Since this first recording was made\, over 80 years ago\, the song has been covered countless times\, most notably by the Mamas & the Papas and Mama Cass.   We took a trip over to the Coombe Lodge in Blagdon (http://www.coombelodge.co.uk)\, a wedding venue that we know well\, to record this video in their magnificent master suite. We've been playing this number live for many years\, so it's nice to finally get it recorded for posterity. COL channel name VAL TheMoonLoungers	1

COL title VAL Frosty the Snowman COL performer VAL Flying Pickets	COL video title VAL Terence Boylan - Alias Boona (1969) COL description VAL Brought up in Buffalo\, New York\, Terence Boylan first appeared on local radio in the late 1950s performing a song he had written at the age of 11. While still in his mid teens\, in the early 1960s\, he performed in Greenwich Village and\, following a chance meeting with Bob Dylan\, was encouraged to pursue a solo music career in upstate New York. He attended Bard College in New York\, and with his older brother John formed a band\, the Ginger Men. By 1967\, they had both signed with Verve Records\, for whom they then recorded an experimental concept album\, Playback\, issued in the name of the Appletree Theatre.  After John Boylan moved to California\, Terence stayed in New York\, returned to college\, and played with classmates Walter Becker and Donald Fagen. With them\, he cut a solo LP\, Alias Boona in 1969\, the title referring to his nickname. He then moved to California\, working again with his brother. After a few years he was signed to Asylum Records\, and recorded his self-titled second album in 1977. Like his previous record\, this was well received by critics but was never more than a cult success. However\, Boylan did enjoy some success as a songwriter when Iain Matthews turned his song "Shake It" into a top five hit.  01. Subterranean Homesick Blues 02. Don't Blame It On Your Wife 03.

COL title VAL Golden Slumbers COL performer VAL Elis Regina	COL video title VAL Brenda Lee - What'd I Say (1964) - with Jimmy Page COL description VAL #BrendaLeeRocks Our channel tradition is "videos only"\, but we make an exception for this audio track. In 1964\, Brenda Lee was in London at the invitation of the Queen of England. She sang "All the Way" at the Royal Variety Performance show. In search of an updated sound\, she also met with Mickie Most who was the hot producer at the time. They chose "Is It True?" as the A-side of a single and Brenda picked "What'd I Say" as the B-side. She wanted to be the first female to cover Ray Charles controversial 1959 hit. "Is It True?" was top twenty on both sides of the Atlantic and earned a Gold Record. "What'd I Say" was a minor hit in some countries. Meanwhile\, in the United States\, the marketing geniuses at the evil record company decided to replace "What'd I Say" with "Just Behind The Rainbow" for the US release. Apparently\, Brenda Lee was Little Miss Adult Contemporary to them and nothing so raw as this track could be allowed. As a result\, "What'd I Say" was never released in the States.  Track Info Recorded at the Decca #2 Studios at 165 Broadhurst Gardens\, West Hampstead\, North London on 17 August 1964 and the demos went out to the radio stations the very next day on 18 Aug 1964. Brenda made 11 promotional appearances for the single.  "Is It True?" entered British charts the week of 9/16/64.  Personnel: Arthur Greenslade (1923 –2003) (piano)\, Jimmy Page(1944-  ) later of Led Zeppelin (guitar)\, Big Jim Sullivan (1941 - 2012)  (guitar); Bobby Graham (1940 -- 2009) (drums)\, Alan Weighell (1922 –2002) (bass)\, Stan Barrett (percussion); Terry Johnson (sound engineer)\, Reg Guest (1930- arranger)\, Mickie Most (born Michael Hayes 1938 -- 2003) (producer).  Bobby Graham recalled the session: "Some acts stood out\, either because they put so much into the recordings. ....... Brenda Lee really did perform. Mickie Most produced that record ('Is It True') at Decca\, they wanted this English sound. John Carter and Kenny Lewis wrote the song\, and also did backing vocals. Jimmy Page and Jim Sullivan were on guitar\, Alan Weighell was on bass\, Stan Barrett on percussion and myself on drums.The arranger was Reg Guest. For the B side\, 'What I'd Say'. we were messing around\, somebody started the lick\, Brenda jumped in and Mickie Most said 'let's record that'. It was done in one take". Note: Graham is mistaken about 'What I'd Say' being a spur of the moment decision. Brenda herself says she wanted to do it and I can't imagine they would go into the session without a "B" side.   Availability UK Import album - Ace CHCHD-1222 "The Queen Of Rock 'N' Roll"  Released 2009  German Import album - Bear Family BFB10025 "Brenda Lee Rocks" Released June 14\, 2011  A session anecdote: Mickie Most recalled that Brenda Lee was late getting to the studio. It turned out that the car sent to pick her up had broken down. Mickie worried that time was short for the usual amount of takes. His fears were allayed when Brenda arrived and ran through "Is It True?". Most told the NME reporter "it sounded like she had been singing it all her life!".  At three years old\, Brenda Mae Tarpley needed to hear a song only once or twice in order to sing it back in perfect pitch and rhythm. This is according to her mother and older sister. Of course\, the Nashville session players had grown used to this extraordinary facility and it was common for them to lay down four to six tracks in one 3 Hr session. When she recorded outside of Nashville\, producers were always amazed at how few tries were needed for a Brenda Lee recording.  SG Barnard recollection:  I was lucky enough to be in the recording studio when Mickie Most produced this song for her. Jimmy Page's guitar sounds good as ever. Mickie insisted that the whole company joined in the choruses for 'What'd I Say'. Such amazing times! RIP Mickie\, industry genius.  NB: SG Barnard was Brenda's Press Officer in the UK. She posted on another YouTube video: "She [Brenda] was the most professional act I ever worked with".   Songwriter: Ray Charles  Alright\, hey hey\, what'd I say\, what'd I say Well\, see the girl with the red dress on\, She can do the boogie all night long All right\, hey\, hey All right\, hear me what'd I say.

COL title VAL The Word COL performer VAL Bettye LaVette	COL video title VAL 'Round Midnight - Bettye LaVette COL description VAL This song is from an EP that was a digital-only release by Anti- Records. I have placed the song here to try to bring more attention to the release. It seems that many are unaware of it's existence. Support the artist and get the download from Itunes\, Amazon\, etc.  Bettye LaVette - vocals  Alan Hill - piano  John Heard: Bass  Danny Frankel: percussion  Tom Hagerman: strings & string arrangements   Produced & mixed by Rob Schnapf  Recorded at Sonara Recorders  Mastered by Mark Chalecki at Little Red Book Mastering   Song writing credits:  Change Is Gonna Come - Sam Cooke   Round Midnight - Thelonious Monk   God Bless The Child - Billie Holiday / Arthur Herzog   Lush Life - Billy Strayhorn   Ain't No Sunshine - Bill Withers   Ain't That Lovin' You - Jimmy Reed  Official Press Release  Having conquered the ghosts of a hard-luck past on her GRAMMY-nominated CD The Scene of the Crime\, BETTYE LAVETTE shines a new light on that past with her latest\, A CHANGE IS GONNA COME SESSIONS. The digital-only EP for Anti- Records\, available exclusively through iTunes starting June 16\, revisits BETTYE's forgotten post-Atlantic Records years as a nightclub singer\, Broadway performer\, and touring cast member opposite Cab Calloway in "Bubbling Brown Sugar."    The EP opens with a stirring solo version of Sam Cooke's posthumous Civil Rights anthem "A Change Is Gonna Come\," a song which BETTYE sang with Jon Bon Jovi in January as part of the "We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial" concert. Joining BETTYE for these Sessions are pianist and musical director Al Hill\, veteran bassist John Heard -- who has accompanied such luminaries as Count Basie\, Cole Porter\, Ella Fitzgerald\, and Art Pepper -- drummer Danny Frankel (k.d. lang\, Lou Reed)\, and Tom Hagerman from DeVotchKa on strings.    A mix of standards and soul classics from BETTYE's 1970s stage and nightclub repertoire rounds out the 6-song set\, including songs by Thelonious Monk\, Duke Ellington\, Bill Withers\, and Jimmy Reed. A rendition of Billie Holiday's "God Bless The Child" -- a song that BETTYE first performed with show-stopping magnificence in "Bubbling Brown Sugar" -- highlights BETTYE's vocal mastery. Rather than attack\, BETTYE approaches these tracks with subtlety -- while nonetheless wresting every ounce and every nuance of meaning from the words she sings. Once more\, BETTYE provides the definitive answer to the question posed by NPR in its review of The Scene of the Crime: "Is there any soul singer who brings more guts\, more conviction and more emotion to her singing?" Absolutely not. COL channel name VAL imnokid	0

COL title VAL All or Nothing COL performer VAL Paul Weller\, Noel Gallagher\, Ian McLagan\, Kenney Jones	COL video title VAL Patsy Cline - The Wayward Wind COL description VAL One of the greatest singers in the history of country music\, Patsy Cline also helped blaze a trail for female singers to assert themselves as an integral part of the Nashville-dominated country music industry. She was not alone in this regard; Kitty Wells had become a star several years before Cline's big hits in the early '60s. Brenda Lee\, who shared Cline's producer\, did just as much to create a country-pop crossover during the same era; Skeeter Davis briefly enjoyed similar success. Cline has the most legendary aura of any female country singer\, however\, perhaps due to an early death that cut her off just after she had entered her prime.  Cline began recording in the mid-'50s\, and although she recorded quite a bit of material between 1955 and 1960 (17 singles in all)\, only one of them was a hit. That song\, "Walkin' After Midnight\," was both a classic and a Top 20 pop smash. Those who are accustomed to Cline's famous early-'60s hits are in for a bit of a shock when surveying her '50s sessions (which have been reissued on several Rhino compilations). At times she sang flat-out rockabilly; she also tried some churchy tear-weepers. She couldn't follow up "Walkin' After Midnight\," however\, in part because of an exploitative deal that limited her to songs from one publishing company.  Circumstances were not wholly to blame for Cline's commercial failures. She would have never made it as a rockabilly singer\, lacking the conviction of Wanda Jackson or the spunk of Brenda Lee. In fact\, in comparison with her best work\, she sounds rather stiff and ill-at-ease on most of her early singles. Things took a radical turn for the better on all fronts in 1960\, when her initial contract expired. With the help of producer Owen Bradley (who had worked on her sessions all along)\, Cline began selecting material that was both more suitable and of a higher quality than her previous outings.  "I Fall to Pieces\," cut at the very first session where Cline was at liberty to record what she wanted\, was the turning point in her career. Reaching number one in the country charts and number 12 pop\, it was the first of several country-pop crossovers she was to enjoy over the next couple of years. More important\, it set a prototype for commercial Nashville country at its best. Owen Bradley crafted lush orchestral arrangements\, with weeping strings and backup vocals by the Jordanaires\, that owed more to pop (in the best sense) than country.  The country elements were provided by the cream of Nashville's session musicians\, including guitarist Hank Garland\, pianist Floyd Cramer\, and drummer Buddy Harmon. Cline's voice sounded richer\, more confident\, and more mature\, with ageless wise and vulnerable qualities that have enabled her records to maintain their appeal with subsequent generations. When k.d. lang recorded her 1988 album Shadowland with Owen Bradley\, it was this phase of Cline's career that she was specifically attempting to emulate.  It's arguable that too much has been made of Cline's crossover appeal to the pop market. Brenda Lee\, whose records were graced with similar Bradley productions\, was actually more successful in this area (although her records were likely targeted toward a younger audience). Cline's appeal was undeniably more adult\, but she was always more successful with country listeners. Her final four Top Ten country singles\, in fact\, didn't make the pop Top 40.  Despite a severe auto accident in 1961\, Cline remained hot through 1961 and 1962\, with "Crazy" and "She's Got You" both becoming big country and pop hits. Much of her achingly romantic material was supplied by fresh talent like Hank Cochran\, Harlan Howard\, and Willie Nelson (who penned "Crazy"). Although her commercial momentum had faded slightly\, she was still at the top of her game when she died in a plane crash in March of 1963\, at the age of 30. She was only a big star for a couple of years\, but her influence was and remains huge. While the standards of professionalism on her recordings have been emulated ever since\, they've rarely been complemented by as much palpable\, at times heartbreaking emotion in the performances. For those who could do without some of more elaborate arrangements of her later years\, many of her relatively unadorned appearances on radio broadcasts have been thankfully preserved and issued.   ~ Richie Unterberger\, All Music Guide  PLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels\, Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

COL title VAL I Feel Like Breaking Up Somebody's Home Tonight COL performer VAL Ann Peebles	COL video title VAL Shirley Bassey - Blues In The Night (1957 Recording) COL description VAL 1957 (A young Shirley Bassey recorded this Johnny Mercer / Harold Arlen American Songbook Standard back in 1956 and it was released as a track on her first LP in 1957.  One of the songs from this LP\, 'Born To Sing The Blues' was released as a single in 1956.  Shirley has recorded & performed many genre's of music over her past 60+ years in show business due to her powerful voice & musical instincts\, but jazz & the blues were among the first that she mastered.  ABOUT this song: "Blues in the Night" is a popular song which has become a pop standard and is generally considered to be part of the Great American Songbook. The music was written by Harold Arlen\, the lyrics by Johnny Mercer\, for a 1941 film begun with the working title Hot Nocturne\, but finally released as Blues in the Night. The song is sung in the film by William Gillespie.  Arlen and Mercer wrote the entire score for the 1941 film Blues in the Night. One requirement was for a blues song to be sung in a jail cell. As usual with Mercer\, the composer wrote the music first\, then Mercer wrote the words. Arlen said\,   The whole thing just poured out. And I knew in my guts\, without even thinking what Johnny would write for a lyric\, that this was strong\, strong\, strong! When Mercer wrote "Blues in the Night"\, I went over his lyric and I started to hum it over his desk. It sounded marvelous once I got to the second stanza but that first twelve was weak tea. On the third or fourth page of his work sheets I saw some lines—one of them was "My momma done tol' me\, when I was in knee pants." I said\, "Why don't you try that?" It was one of the very few times I've ever suggested anything like that to John.  When they finished writing the song\, Mercer called a friend\, singer Margaret Whiting\, and asked if they could come over and play it for her. She suggested they come later because she had dinner guests—Mickey Rooney\, Judy Garland\, Mel Tormé\, and Martha Raye. Instead\, Arlen and Mercer went right over. Margaret Whiting remembered what happened then:   They came in the back door\, sat down at the piano and played the score of "Blues in the Night". I remember forever the reaction. Mel got up and said\, "I can't believe it." Martha couldn't say a word. Mickey Rooney said\, "That's the greatest thing I've ever heard." Judy Garland said\, "Play it again." We had them play it seven times. Judy and I ran to the piano to see who was going to learn it first. It was a lovely night.  A few of the great singers/musicians from the past who recorded this song were Ella Fitzgerald\, Frank Sinatra\, Rosemary Clooney\, Dinah Shore\, Judy Garland\, Bing Crosby\, Woody Herman\, Louis Armstrong\, Jo Stafford\, Doris Day\, Billy Eckstine\, Julie London\, Cab Calloway\, Kate Smith\, Van Morrison\, The Group Chicago\, and of course\, Shirley who was a teenager when she recorded it.   A few of the younger generation artists who have recorded this song include Amy Winehouse\, Eva Cassidy\, and Katie Melua.  ALL versions are Great\, because the song itself is a Classic for ALL generations!  LYRICS: My mama done tol' me\, when I was in pig tails My mama done tol' me\, " Child a man'll sweet talk" And give ya the big eye\, but when the sweet talkin's done A man is a two-face\, A worrisome thing who'll leave ya to sing the blues in the night  Now the rain's a-fallin'\, hear the train's a-callin\, "Whooee!" (My mama done tol' me) Hear dat lonesome whistle blowin' 'cross the trestle\, "Whooee!" (My mama done tol' me) A-whooee-ah-whooee ol' clickety-clack's a-echoin' back th' blues in the night  The evenin' breeze'll start the trees to cryin' and the moon'll hide its light when you get the blues in the night Take my word\, the mockingbird'll sing the saddest kind o' song\, he knows things are wrong\, and he's right  From Natchez to Mobile\, from Memphis to St. Joe\, wherever the four winds blow I been in some big towns an' heard me some big talk\, but there is one thing I know A man is a two-face\, a worrisome thing who'll leave ya to sing the blues in the night  Special Thanks to Pieter and Astrid from the Shirley Bassey blog and all those who have provided wonderful pictures of Shirley!

Fair use is a use permitted by copyright statute that might otherwise be infringing. Non-profit\, educational or personal use tips the balance in favour of fair use. count owen and his calypsonians - kalypso records japanese repress - mento Count Owen's middle period mento album\, "Calypsos Down Jamaica Way" was originally published in 1960 on the label "Kalypso"\, a subsidiary of "Melodisc".  Mento is a Jamaican music style that is largely unknown outside of that is the grandpappy of reggae. For a ska or reggae fan\, mento sounds familiar and exotic and sometimes unfamiliar. Mento recordings are difficult to come by\, but worth seeking out. It's music that lifts my spirits and relaxes my mind whenever I hear it.  During mento's middle period of the 1960s\, Count Owen became prolific\, as he recorded a string of five LPs that moved from mento to ska to rock steady.  "Down Jamaica Way" is the first Count Owen LP. It sticks to traditional rural mento instrumentation\, and for the most part\, repertoire.

COL title VAL Gimme Shelter COL performer VAL Hawkwind	COL video title VAL Marc Cohn sings The Letter from his new album Listening Booth\, 1970 COL description VAL Listening Booth:1970 represents a continuation of a creative resurgence for Cohn\, ultimately brought on by one of the strangest and scariest events of his life. In 2005\, while driving back to his hotel with his band and tour manager after a show in Denver\, Cohn was shot in the head by a would - be carjacker. Although the bullet had to be removed from his left temple\, it miraculously missed penetrating his skull by a centimeter\, causing no physical damage and allowing him to be released from the hospital the next day. After working through a bout with post-traumatic stress syndrome\, Cohn has been busier than ever. Ending a nearly ten-year absence from the studio\, he released one of his most critically acclaimed records\, Join The Parade\, in 2007 and followed it with well over 150 shows across the country. "I had always had my priorities straight when it came to my family. For me\, it never felt right bringing children into the world and then spending all your time in a studio or a tour bus. But that night in Denver somehow brought me a new appreciation for my work and my audience."    Now\, Listening Booth:1970 ultimately brings Cohn back to where he began-- writing songs like 'Walking In Memphis' which spoke so eloquently about the transformative\, healing power of music. Like that hit single\, Listening Booth: 1970 is really the soundtrack to his life. As Cohn reflects\, "It seemed like such a natural progression for me to do a record like this because\, if you've been following my records from my first single\, I have been paying tribute to musicians through my writing all along\, from Al Green to Elvis to Levon Helm to Charlie Christian\, It's really been a touchstone for me. Now I'm just repaying a debt of gratitude to the artists who've changed my life and taught me how to do what I do." COL channel name VAL TheGigante	0

COL title VAL Let Me Be the One COL performer VAL Aquarian Dream	COL video title VAL François Glorieux plays The Beatles - 07 - Yellow submarine (Beethoven) COL description VAL Improvisation on "Yellow submarine" in the style of Ludwig Beethoven. La plus grande originalité de cet étonnant LP réside sans doute dans le fait que chaque pièce a été entièrement improvisée. En d'autres termes : jouée spontanément sans préparation\, ni partition. Si François Glorieux est le seul pianiste de notre XXè siècle à s'être aventuré aussi loin dans le domaine de l'improvisation\, il ne révèle ici qu'UN des des multiples aspects de ce "grand art" qu'il pratique comme personne : l'improvisation de style. Et cela tient du miracle! Loin de se contenter d'un "pastiche à la manière de ..."\, il nous démontre comment les noms illustres de l'histoire de la musique auraient pu traiter les admirables mélodies des Beatles. Certains thèmes ont été reproduits intégralement\, d'autres ont été légèrement modifiés ou adaptés à l'image même du compositeur! Et on chercherait en vain un défaut de style ou de construction\, une faute de goût\, une lacune. Comme le disait si bien un critique musical allemand : " François Glorieux est en quelque sorte le faux-monnayeur de l'improvisation\, car c'est si parfait\, si réussi\, qu'on ne sait s'il joue le vrai ou le faux."

The critics of the 1920's described the song as "infectious" and that actually was (and still is) a quite accurate description of this captivating tune.  The name linked forever to the song is that of Al Jolson who made the song a worldwide success but some people may also remember Judy Garland's version which was more extravert and outspoken than Jolson's "classic" interpretation. Here Gunter Noris captures the song's infectiousness by adding a pleasant sounding beat while bearing in mind the sound of the "golden twenties" as well. From the Album "Plays Gershwin" here's Gunter Noris and His Orchestra taking you back in time with Gershwin's "Swanee".  Enjoy. COL channel name VAL Socratess2007	0

He left before graduating to enroll at the Paris Conservatoire in order to concentrate on a vocal career. He started in the cabarets of Paris at the age of 17\, and was subsequently accompanied on his first album by the pianist/composer Mireille\, whose song Couchés dans le foin became a great success. Later\, he partnered the wildly popular Mistinguett at the Casino de Paris and boosted his career considerably. He was the first cabaret singer to use a microphone in his stage act. In the 1920s he spent time in Brazil where his recordings remain extremely popular today. In 1937\, he won the Grand Prix du Disque for the song "Vous qui passez sans me voir\," written for him by Charles Trenet and Johnny Hess. That same year\, he went to the United States\, where he sang on live radio broadcasts for CBS and made several records in the English language. On Broadway\, he worked with luminaries such as Cole Porter and George Gershwin. He returned to Paris but with the German occupation of France in World War II\, he went back to America for the duration. Sablon became one of the most widely acclaimed male French singers\, considered second only in overall lifetime popularity to Maurice Chevalier. His records sold in the millions around the world and he is frequently referred to as the French equivalent of America's Bing Crosby. During his career\, he recorded with some of the world's top musicians\, including Django Reinhardt and Stéphane Grappelli. Sablon is credited with arranging Reinhardt's debut in a fashionable cabaret in 1933. He is also recognized for his talents as a lyricist and a composer. Sablon appeared in a number of motion pictures and television films performing as a vocalist or pianist\, his last coming in 1984 when he sang "April in Paris" in Mistral's Daughter\, the popular American TV miniseries filmed in France. Jean died in 1994 and was interred in the Cimetière du Montparnasse in Paris.  Jean Sablon est un auteur-compositeur-interprète français. Il est l'un des premiers chanteurs français à s'intéresser au jazz. Créateur de plusieurs œuvres de Mireille et Jean Nohain\, puis de Charles Trenet\, il est le premier à utiliser un microphone sur une scène française en 1936. Vedette du disque et de la radio\, il quitte la France en 1937 pour un contrat à la NBC. Ses shows font de lui une vedette de premier plan aux États-Unis. Chanteur français désormais le plus international de sa génération\, il devient l'ambassadeur de la chanson et se consacre à ses tournées sur les cinq continents\, retrouvant régulièrement les principales salles françaises. Il conclut ses soixante-et-un ans de carrière par d'ultimes adieux en 1984. COL channel name VAL MusicFromParis	0

For entertainment/promotional purposes only. Enjoy the music!  This song is from the 2008 cd entitled "Ramblin' Son" by Julian Fauth.  Very real storytelling talent on top of amazing piano skills. Julian is a real interesting Toronto based singer & piano player.  His blues style is more of a traditional 'pre-war barrelhouse blues & boogie-woogie with infusions of gospel & jazz'.  I really love how he tells a story with his music.  He plays quite often in the Toronto area so check him out if you can.

Her second Riverside session (and her third recording)\, It's Magic has been reissued on this CD in the Original Jazz Classics series. The backup musicians are among the best in jazz at the time (Kenny Dorham or Art Farmer on trumpet\, trombonist Curtis Fuller\, Benny Golson on tenor\, Jerome Richardson or Sahib Shihab on reeds\, pianist Wynton Kelly\, Paul Chambers or Sam Jones on bass\, and drummer Philly Joe Jones) and they have opportunities to play short solos. Lincoln is heard at her early best on such numbers as "I Am in Love\," "An Occasional Man\," "Out of the Past" and Randy Weston's "Little Niles." Recommended. COL channel name VAL OubaelPhoumet	0

COL title VAL No Moon at All COL performer VAL Ben Sidran	COL video title VAL KAREL GOTT - VŠECH SVÝCH SNŮ JÁ RÁD SE VZDÁM (vila jevany) g COL description VAL Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/pages/Karel-GOTT-grmelino/161629653886846  Karel Gott byl šťastný \, když přišel nápad na otevření muzea \, co však následovalo pár let po té \, musel být moc zklamaný - tak jako plno jeho věrných fanoušků.  Obecnou známost a věhlas dal Jevanům právě Karel Gott\, jediná česká šoubyznysová hvězda příhraničního a světového významu. Ten si v roce 1969\, hned na kraji Jevan směrem od kutnohorské silnice\, koupil od rodiny Ročkových vilu pražského továrníka Aloise Köppela z roku 1930. V 80. letech ji ale od Karla Gotta koupil Miroslav Provod\, později známý jako kamarád Františka Mrázka a jeden ze šéfů pražského podsvětí\, který si nedávno odpykal pětiletý trest \, asi ne moc dobré spojení. Vila však po vzájemné dohodě obou mužů zůstala psaná na Gotta\, aby nemusel řadový programátor vysvětlovat\, kde vzal v 80. letech 170 tisíc západoněmeckých marek v hotovosti. V roce 1988 Gott prodal národnímu podniku Narex za zhruba 6 milionů korun\, které pak předal Provodovi\, který se vrátil z vězení a potřeboval peníze. Ale v roce 1996\, i kvůli nevyjasněným smluvním vztahům\, vilu opět od Narexu odkoupil. Ač s přestávkami vlastnil dům přes tři desítky let\, nikdy se zde natrvalo neusídlil. Dům byl sice plně vybaven\, zařízen na život jednoho i více lidí\, ale opravdovým domovem Gottovi nikdy nebyl.  V roce 2005 ji za 11 milionů prodal Janu Moťovskému\, který v ní otevřel muzeum Karla Gott Gottland - což byla skvělá myšlenka a mnoho fanoušků toto ocenilo. Muzeum\, ač na internetu stále „žijí" jeho stránky\, je bohužel už pár let zavřené. Návštěvnost po prvotním okouzlení opadla\, Jan Moťovský zmizel kdesi na Francouzské Riviéře a Gottland tímto chátrá. V současnosti má vila nového majitele\, zatím však na opravy a oživení čeká. Na rozdíl od Karla Gotta se Jevany staly skutečným domovem skladateli Karlu Svobodovi a později i kapelníkovi Ladislavu Štaidlovi. Ti dva měli dokonce své domy na břehu Jevanského rybníka hned vedle sebe. Štaidl se později přestěhoval do Prahy\, vilu obývá jeho syn. Karel Svoboda se na zápraží svého domu v roce 2007 zastřelil.  Chceme vidět Mistra! Právě Gottova vila se stala už v 70. letech 20. století důvodem\, proč Jevany získaly pověst prominentního letoviska a proč se sem od 70. let minulého století táhly zástupy výletníků\, aby zhlédli vilu (a zahlédli za záclonou) a také Mistra. Shodou okolností\, hned přes silnici naproti Gottovi měl víkendovou chatu všemocný František Hrabal\, ředitel Pragokoncertu\, organizace\, který za socialismu provozovala management většině vrcholových umělců z oblasti populární hudby.    Zřejmě se Karel a jeho věrní fanoušci už nedočkají \, obnovení vily a muzea dohromady \, byl to skvělí nápad a však zmařen \, to si Karel Gott nezaslouží \, toto opravdu ne \, dle mě je to ostuda \, budeme však doufat.

There have been several covers of the song (including The Birds and Saint Etienne in English) but the most known is probably the 1996 cover recording by the French artist Mylène Farmer and the French-born musician Khaled. The Farmer/Khaled cover was performed during Farmer's 1996 concert tour. After three live performances\, the song was finally released as the first single from Farmer's second live album\, Live à Bercy on 29 April 1997\, and became a top five hit in Belgium.  Background and live performances  There is a studio version of this duet\, but it was never released. This studio version was performed in lip-sync in a single television show\, Tip top\, broadcast on a French channel and host by Éric Jean-Jean\, where Farmer was invited to promote her single "Comme j'ai mal". Previously\, the show proposed to Farmer a list of singers with whom she would sing a song. She chose Khaled and decided to perform a cover of Polnareff's song\, "La Poupée qui fait non"\, and the recording lasted four hours.  Interviewed by the French magazine Instant-Mag\, Thierry Rogen\, the sound engineer who has participated in the recording\, said: "I have participated in the single "La Poupée qui fait non" with Khaled. Laurant [Boutonnat] was absent. The recording was made in the studio Merga in Suresnes in the right mood. It has been very rapid. Mylène [Farmer] and Khaled were together for four hours in total".  Farmer said she chose the song because it was the first song she learned when she was a child\, and she loved Michel Polnareff's work. Khaled also said: "This is a common idea\, we wanted to sing together. We loved both Polnareff. Personally\, I think it's the first song I learned."  The live version\, which was released in 1997\, was performed only three nights (two in Geneva and the last at Bercy) as a duet on stage during the 1996 tour. This remained the only collaboration between two artists.  The two remixes available on the CD maxi and the promotional vinyl were produced by Mylène Farmer (this is the only time she has participated in remixes of one of her singles)\, in collaboration with Thierry Rogen. However\, these remixes have not been well appreciated by the singer's fans\, because almost all the words have disappeared.  When the song was released\, Khaled declared that he found Farmer very sympathetic.[8] However\, later\, he said he had felt used by her\, since she put herself forward all the time when they performed the song and were interviewed; according to a 2009 edition of Nouvel Observateur\, Khaled qualified this collaboration as a "trap".  Critical reception  The song generally received negative reviews. According to the author Erwan Chuberre\, the duo Khaled / Farmer "which blends the sun and the darkness is on the limit of credibility". "The two worlds [of both singers] really failed to merge and this cover is soon forgotten!" Instant-Mag considered as "absurd" the fact that the studio version was never released\, and found that the song "was much harmed by the remixes that accompany it\, in which we have as the hazy impression that Mylène was amused herself (and without supervision) to press the buttons on the console of Thierry Rogen".  In France\, the single debuted at a peak of number six on 3 May 1997. However\, like Farmer's previous top ten hits\, it dropped rather quickly and fell off the top 50 after eight weeks.  Surprisingly\, the song was a big success in Belgium\, where it had a better chart trajectory in the Ultratop 40 than in France. It appeared on the chart for a total of 18 weeks from 24 May 1997\, peaked at number five on 21 June\, and managed to remain for eight weeks in the top ten. The song ranked at number 41 in the End of year chart. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

COL title VAL Yellow Submarine COL performer VAL François Glorieux	COL video title VAL Oh Well - Oh Well COL description VAL No one knows who these guys are\, so I thought I'd post their songs. From Wikipedia\, the free encyclopedia  Oh Well were a UK dance group that started in the late 1980s. They were relatively successful during their peak in 1989\, but broke up soon after\, due to lack of chart success thereafter.  The group had two UK chart singles in 1989 and 1990: the eponymous "Oh Well" single was released in late 1989 and peaked at number 28 on the UK Singles Chart for two weeks\, starting on October 28. Their second single\, a cover of Golden Earring's "Radar Love"\, was released in early 1990 and debuted and peaked at number 63 on March 3.  The band can be referred to as a "one hit wonder"\, seeing as how they only had one single reach the Top 40. "Oh Well" was featured on Now That's What I Call Music! 16\, the sixteenth volume of the popular British hits series. COL channel name VAL 3Life3	0

COL title VAL Good Night COL performer VAL Giovanni	COL video title VAL Patsy Cline - The Wayward Wind COL description VAL One of the greatest singers in the history of country music\, Patsy Cline also helped blaze a trail for female singers to assert themselves as an integral part of the Nashville-dominated country music industry. She was not alone in this regard; Kitty Wells had become a star several years before Cline's big hits in the early '60s. Brenda Lee\, who shared Cline's producer\, did just as much to create a country-pop crossover during the same era; Skeeter Davis briefly enjoyed similar success. Cline has the most legendary aura of any female country singer\, however\, perhaps due to an early death that cut her off just after she had entered her prime.  Cline began recording in the mid-'50s\, and although she recorded quite a bit of material between 1955 and 1960 (17 singles in all)\, only one of them was a hit. That song\, "Walkin' After Midnight\," was both a classic and a Top 20 pop smash. Those who are accustomed to Cline's famous early-'60s hits are in for a bit of a shock when surveying her '50s sessions (which have been reissued on several Rhino compilations). At times she sang flat-out rockabilly; she also tried some churchy tear-weepers. She couldn't follow up "Walkin' After Midnight\," however\, in part because of an exploitative deal that limited her to songs from one publishing company.  Circumstances were not wholly to blame for Cline's commercial failures. She would have never made it as a rockabilly singer\, lacking the conviction of Wanda Jackson or the spunk of Brenda Lee. In fact\, in comparison with her best work\, she sounds rather stiff and ill-at-ease on most of her early singles. Things took a radical turn for the better on all fronts in 1960\, when her initial contract expired. With the help of producer Owen Bradley (who had worked on her sessions all along)\, Cline began selecting material that was both more suitable and of a higher quality than her previous outings.  "I Fall to Pieces\," cut at the very first session where Cline was at liberty to record what she wanted\, was the turning point in her career. Reaching number one in the country charts and number 12 pop\, it was the first of several country-pop crossovers she was to enjoy over the next couple of years. More important\, it set a prototype for commercial Nashville country at its best. Owen Bradley crafted lush orchestral arrangements\, with weeping strings and backup vocals by the Jordanaires\, that owed more to pop (in the best sense) than country.  The country elements were provided by the cream of Nashville's session musicians\, including guitarist Hank Garland\, pianist Floyd Cramer\, and drummer Buddy Harmon. Cline's voice sounded richer\, more confident\, and more mature\, with ageless wise and vulnerable qualities that have enabled her records to maintain their appeal with subsequent generations. When k.d. lang recorded her 1988 album Shadowland with Owen Bradley\, it was this phase of Cline's career that she was specifically attempting to emulate.  It's arguable that too much has been made of Cline's crossover appeal to the pop market. Brenda Lee\, whose records were graced with similar Bradley productions\, was actually more successful in this area (although her records were likely targeted toward a younger audience). Cline's appeal was undeniably more adult\, but she was always more successful with country listeners. Her final four Top Ten country singles\, in fact\, didn't make the pop Top 40.  Despite a severe auto accident in 1961\, Cline remained hot through 1961 and 1962\, with "Crazy" and "She's Got You" both becoming big country and pop hits. Much of her achingly romantic material was supplied by fresh talent like Hank Cochran\, Harlan Howard\, and Willie Nelson (who penned "Crazy"). Although her commercial momentum had faded slightly\, she was still at the top of her game when she died in a plane crash in March of 1963\, at the age of 30. She was only a big star for a couple of years\, but her influence was and remains huge. While the standards of professionalism on her recordings have been emulated ever since\, they've rarely been complemented by as much palpable\, at times heartbreaking emotion in the performances. For those who could do without some of more elaborate arrangements of her later years\, many of her relatively unadorned appearances on radio broadcasts have been thankfully preserved and issued.   ~ Richie Unterberger\, All Music Guide  PLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels\, Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

It has become a pop standard and an even more popular country song since it helped make Hank Williams famous in the 1940s. Published through Tin Pan Alley in 1922\, the song was first recorded by the popular contralto Elsie Clark. Later that year\, it was recorded by Jack Shea (not the 1932 Olympic medalist speed skater) on Vocalion 14333. This recording contains a verse that no later versions include. Emmett Miller recorded it on Okeh 40465\, September 1\, 1925. He re-recorded it on June 12 1928\, accompanied by his Georgia Crackers (which included Tommy Dorsey\, Jimmy Dorsey\, Eddie Lang\, and Leo McConville). On November 26\, 1926\, blues singer Bertha "Chippie" Hill recorded a different song titled "Lovesick Blues" (Okeh 8453). The song was a minor hit for her. The first country music version of the song was by Rex Griffin (Decca 5570)\, September 25\, 1939. The song's most recognizable version did not come until 1948\, with Williams' hit rendition. Though Williams had scored a few hits prior to "Lovesick Blues\," the song was the first of many number one hits on Country radio for the singer. It also marked one of the songwriter's few cover songs. The song's monumental success led to Williams' tenure at the Grand Ole Opry and remains one of his best remembered songs. In 2004\, it was one of 50 recordings chosen that year by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry. His version of the song appeared in such films as The Last Picture Show (1971) and The Shawshank Redemption (1994). Since Williams' hit rendition of the song\, it has been covered by a wide array of performers. Country performers including Slim Whitman (1957)\, Patsy Cline (1960)\, Glen Campbell (1974)\, Charley Pride (1973)\, and LeAnn Rimes (1999)\, have all recorded their own renditions of the song. Floyd Cramer's rock-and-roll cover crossed over to pop audiences in 1962\, while Frank Ifield took the song to #1 in the United Kingdom in 1963. In the 1970s\, Jerry Lee Lewis\, Little Richard\, Arlo Guthrie\, Don McLean\, Etta James and Linda Ronstadt all covered the song. George Strait took his cover all the way to #24 on the country chart in 1992 with little traditional promotion of the single. Alt-country artist Ryan Adams recorded the song for Timeless\, a Hank Williams tribute album. COL channel name VAL RPMmanToledo Ohio	0

COL title VAL Can't Take My Eyes off You COL performer VAL The Easybeats	COL video title VAL Patsy Cline - The Wayward Wind COL description VAL One of the greatest singers in the history of country music\, Patsy Cline also helped blaze a trail for female singers to assert themselves as an integral part of the Nashville-dominated country music industry. She was not alone in this regard; Kitty Wells had become a star several years before Cline's big hits in the early '60s. Brenda Lee\, who shared Cline's producer\, did just as much to create a country-pop crossover during the same era; Skeeter Davis briefly enjoyed similar success. Cline has the most legendary aura of any female country singer\, however\, perhaps due to an early death that cut her off just after she had entered her prime.  Cline began recording in the mid-'50s\, and although she recorded quite a bit of material between 1955 and 1960 (17 singles in all)\, only one of them was a hit. That song\, "Walkin' After Midnight\," was both a classic and a Top 20 pop smash. Those who are accustomed to Cline's famous early-'60s hits are in for a bit of a shock when surveying her '50s sessions (which have been reissued on several Rhino compilations). At times she sang flat-out rockabilly; she also tried some churchy tear-weepers. She couldn't follow up "Walkin' After Midnight\," however\, in part because of an exploitative deal that limited her to songs from one publishing company.  Circumstances were not wholly to blame for Cline's commercial failures. She would have never made it as a rockabilly singer\, lacking the conviction of Wanda Jackson or the spunk of Brenda Lee. In fact\, in comparison with her best work\, she sounds rather stiff and ill-at-ease on most of her early singles. Things took a radical turn for the better on all fronts in 1960\, when her initial contract expired. With the help of producer Owen Bradley (who had worked on her sessions all along)\, Cline began selecting material that was both more suitable and of a higher quality than her previous outings.  "I Fall to Pieces\," cut at the very first session where Cline was at liberty to record what she wanted\, was the turning point in her career. Reaching number one in the country charts and number 12 pop\, it was the first of several country-pop crossovers she was to enjoy over the next couple of years. More important\, it set a prototype for commercial Nashville country at its best. Owen Bradley crafted lush orchestral arrangements\, with weeping strings and backup vocals by the Jordanaires\, that owed more to pop (in the best sense) than country.  The country elements were provided by the cream of Nashville's session musicians\, including guitarist Hank Garland\, pianist Floyd Cramer\, and drummer Buddy Harmon. Cline's voice sounded richer\, more confident\, and more mature\, with ageless wise and vulnerable qualities that have enabled her records to maintain their appeal with subsequent generations. When k.d. lang recorded her 1988 album Shadowland with Owen Bradley\, it was this phase of Cline's career that she was specifically attempting to emulate.  It's arguable that too much has been made of Cline's crossover appeal to the pop market. Brenda Lee\, whose records were graced with similar Bradley productions\, was actually more successful in this area (although her records were likely targeted toward a younger audience). Cline's appeal was undeniably more adult\, but she was always more successful with country listeners. Her final four Top Ten country singles\, in fact\, didn't make the pop Top 40.  Despite a severe auto accident in 1961\, Cline remained hot through 1961 and 1962\, with "Crazy" and "She's Got You" both becoming big country and pop hits. Much of her achingly romantic material was supplied by fresh talent like Hank Cochran\, Harlan Howard\, and Willie Nelson (who penned "Crazy"). Although her commercial momentum had faded slightly\, she was still at the top of her game when she died in a plane crash in March of 1963\, at the age of 30. She was only a big star for a couple of years\, but her influence was and remains huge. While the standards of professionalism on her recordings have been emulated ever since\, they've rarely been complemented by as much palpable\, at times heartbreaking emotion in the performances. For those who could do without some of more elaborate arrangements of her later years\, many of her relatively unadorned appearances on radio broadcasts have been thankfully preserved and issued.   ~ Richie Unterberger\, All Music Guide  PLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels\, Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

COL title VAL I Only Have Eyes For You COL performer VAL Art Garfunkel	COL video title VAL Erroll Garner Trio - I Only Have Eyes For You (Savoy Records 1949) COL description VAL "I Only Have Eyes for You" is a popular song by composer Harry Warren and lyricist Al Dubin\, written in 1934 for the film Dames where it was introduced by Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler.  Erroll Louis Garner (June 15\, 1921 -- January 2\, 1977) was an American jazz pianist and composer known for his swing playing and ballads. His best-known composition\, the ballad "Misty"\, has become a jazz standard. Allmusic.com calls him "one of the most distinctive of all pianists" and a "brilliant virtuoso".  Born with his twin brother Ernest in Pittsburgh\, Pennsylvania\, to an African American family on June 15\, 1921\, Erroll began playing piano at the age of three. His elder siblings were taught piano by Miss Bowman. From an early age Erroll would sit down and play anything she'd demonstrated\, just like Miss Bowman\, his eldest sister Martha said. He attended George Westinghouse High School\, as did fellow pianists Billy Strayhorn and Ahmad Jamal. Garner was self-taught and remained an "ear player" all his life – he never learned to read music. At the age of seven\, he began appearing on the radio station KDKA in Pittsburgh with a group called the Candy Kids. By the age of 11\, he was playing on the Allegheny riverboats. At 14 in 1937\, he joined local saxophonist Leroy Brown.  He played locally in the shadow of his older pianist brother Linton Garner and moved to New York in 1944. He briefly worked with the bassist Slam Stewart\, and though not a bebop musician per se\, in 1947 played with Charlie Parker on the famous "Cool Blues" session. Although his admission to the Pittsburgh music union was initially refused because of his inability to read music\, they eventually relented in 1956 and made him an honorary member. Garner is credited with having a superb memory of music. After attending a concert by the Russian classical pianist Emil Gilels\, Garner returned to his apartment and was able to play a large portion of the performed music by recall.  Short in stature (5 ft 2 in)\, Garner performed sitting on multiple telephone directories.] Considering that his small hands could barely span an octave on the piano keyboard\, his rapid right-handed octave and chordal passages were all the more amazing. He was also known for his vocalizations while playing\, which can be heard on many of his recordings. He helped to bridge the gap for jazz musicians between nightclubs and the concert hall.  Garner made many tours both at home and abroad\, and produced a large volume of recorded work. He was\, reportedly\, The Tonight Show host Johnny Carson's favorite jazz musician\, appearing on Carson's show many times over the years.  Garner's first recordings were made in late 1944 at the apartment of Timme Rosenkrantz; these were subsequently issued as the five-volume Overture to Dawn series on Blue Note Records. His recording career advanced in the late 1940s when several sides such as "Fine and Dandy" and "Sweet 'n' Lovely" were cut. His 1955 live album Concert by the Sea was a best-selling jazz album in its day and features Eddie Calhoun on bass and Denzil Best on drums. This recording of a performance at the Sunset Center\, a former school in Carmel-by-the-Sea\, California\, was made using relatively primitive sound equipment\, but for George Avakian the decision to release the recording was easy. Other works include 1951's Long Ago and Far Away and 1974's Magician\, both of which see Garner perform a number of classic standards. Often the trio was expanded to add Latin percussion\, usually a conga.  In 1964\, Garner appeared in the UK on the music series Jazz 625 broadcast on the BBC's new second channel. The programme was hosted by Steve Race\, who introduced Garner's trio with Eddie Calhoun on bass and Kelly Martin on drums. Because Garner could not write down his musical ideas\, he used to record them on tape\, to be later transcribed by others.  Erroll Garner died from a cardiac arrest on January 2\, 1977. He is buried in Pittsburgh's Homewood Cemetery.  Erroll's accompanied by John Simmons (bass) and Alvin Stoller (drums).  Recorded in Los Angeles\, March 29\, 1949. (Savoy Records)  Are the stars out tonight?

COL title VAL Thinking out Loud COL performer VAL Jasmine Thompson	COL video title VAL Gunter Noris and His Orchestra -  Swanee COL description VAL It was George Gershwin's very first "hit" and his biggest selling song : "Swanee".  The critics of the 1920's described the song as "infectious" and that actually was (and still is) a quite accurate description of this captivating tune.  The name linked forever to the song is that of Al Jolson who made the song a worldwide success but some people may also remember Judy Garland's version which was more extravert and outspoken than Jolson's "classic" interpretation. Here Gunter Noris captures the song's infectiousness by adding a pleasant sounding beat while bearing in mind the sound of the "golden twenties" as well. From the Album "Plays Gershwin" here's Gunter Noris and His Orchestra taking you back in time with Gershwin's "Swanee".  Enjoy. COL channel name VAL Socratess2007	0

COL title VAL Tonight I'll Be Staying Here With You COL performer VAL Ann Peebles	COL video title VAL Shirley Bassey - Blues In The Night (1957 Recording) COL description VAL 1957 (A young Shirley Bassey recorded this Johnny Mercer / Harold Arlen American Songbook Standard back in 1956 and it was released as a track on her first LP in 1957.  One of the songs from this LP\, 'Born To Sing The Blues' was released as a single in 1956.  Shirley has recorded & performed many genre's of music over her past 60+ years in show business due to her powerful voice & musical instincts\, but jazz & the blues were among the first that she mastered.  ABOUT this song: "Blues in the Night" is a popular song which has become a pop standard and is generally considered to be part of the Great American Songbook. The music was written by Harold Arlen\, the lyrics by Johnny Mercer\, for a 1941 film begun with the working title Hot Nocturne\, but finally released as Blues in the Night. The song is sung in the film by William Gillespie.  Arlen and Mercer wrote the entire score for the 1941 film Blues in the Night. One requirement was for a blues song to be sung in a jail cell. As usual with Mercer\, the composer wrote the music first\, then Mercer wrote the words. Arlen said\,   The whole thing just poured out. And I knew in my guts\, without even thinking what Johnny would write for a lyric\, that this was strong\, strong\, strong! When Mercer wrote "Blues in the Night"\, I went over his lyric and I started to hum it over his desk. It sounded marvelous once I got to the second stanza but that first twelve was weak tea. On the third or fourth page of his work sheets I saw some lines—one of them was "My momma done tol' me\, when I was in knee pants." I said\, "Why don't you try that?" It was one of the very few times I've ever suggested anything like that to John.  When they finished writing the song\, Mercer called a friend\, singer Margaret Whiting\, and asked if they could come over and play it for her. She suggested they come later because she had dinner guests—Mickey Rooney\, Judy Garland\, Mel Tormé\, and Martha Raye. Instead\, Arlen and Mercer went right over. Margaret Whiting remembered what happened then:   They came in the back door\, sat down at the piano and played the score of "Blues in the Night". I remember forever the reaction. Mel got up and said\, "I can't believe it." Martha couldn't say a word. Mickey Rooney said\, "That's the greatest thing I've ever heard." Judy Garland said\, "Play it again." We had them play it seven times. Judy and I ran to the piano to see who was going to learn it first. It was a lovely night.  A few of the great singers/musicians from the past who recorded this song were Ella Fitzgerald\, Frank Sinatra\, Rosemary Clooney\, Dinah Shore\, Judy Garland\, Bing Crosby\, Woody Herman\, Louis Armstrong\, Jo Stafford\, Doris Day\, Billy Eckstine\, Julie London\, Cab Calloway\, Kate Smith\, Van Morrison\, The Group Chicago\, and of course\, Shirley who was a teenager when she recorded it.   A few of the younger generation artists who have recorded this song include Amy Winehouse\, Eva Cassidy\, and Katie Melua.  ALL versions are Great\, because the song itself is a Classic for ALL generations!  LYRICS: My mama done tol' me\, when I was in pig tails My mama done tol' me\, " Child a man'll sweet talk" And give ya the big eye\, but when the sweet talkin's done A man is a two-face\, A worrisome thing who'll leave ya to sing the blues in the night  Now the rain's a-fallin'\, hear the train's a-callin\, "Whooee!" (My mama done tol' me) Hear dat lonesome whistle blowin' 'cross the trestle\, "Whooee!" (My mama done tol' me) A-whooee-ah-whooee ol' clickety-clack's a-echoin' back th' blues in the night  The evenin' breeze'll start the trees to cryin' and the moon'll hide its light when you get the blues in the night Take my word\, the mockingbird'll sing the saddest kind o' song\, he knows things are wrong\, and he's right  From Natchez to Mobile\, from Memphis to St. Joe\, wherever the four winds blow I been in some big towns an' heard me some big talk\, but there is one thing I know A man is a two-face\, a worrisome thing who'll leave ya to sing the blues in the night  Special Thanks to Pieter and Astrid from the Shirley Bassey blog and all those who have provided wonderful pictures of Shirley!

While still in his mid teens\, in the early 1960s\, he performed in Greenwich Village and\, following a chance meeting with Bob Dylan\, was encouraged to pursue a solo music career in upstate New York. He attended Bard College in New York\, and with his older brother John formed a band\, the Ginger Men. By 1967\, they had both signed with Verve Records\, for whom they then recorded an experimental concept album\, Playback\, issued in the name of the Appletree Theatre.  After John Boylan moved to California\, Terence stayed in New York\, returned to college\, and played with classmates Walter Becker and Donald Fagen. With them\, he cut a solo LP\, Alias Boona in 1969\, the title referring to his nickname. He then moved to California\, working again with his brother. After a few years he was signed to Asylum Records\, and recorded his self-titled second album in 1977. Like his previous record\, this was well received by critics but was never more than a cult success. However\, Boylan did enjoy some success as a songwriter when Iain Matthews turned his song "Shake It" into a top five hit.  01. Subterranean Homesick Blues 02. Don't Blame It On Your Wife 03.

COL title VAL Watch What Happens COL performer VAL Connie Evingson	COL video title VAL Square Set - Something you've got COL description VAL South African band formed in March 1966 (as per Derek Marks himself) by:  1. Nol Klinkhamer (keyboards) 2. Neville Whitmill (vocals) 3. Keith Moffat (drums) 4. Derek Marks (bass)  In August 1966\, this line-up recorded the 7” single “Silence Is Golden”\, as well as the album with the same title. Ian Martin was the recording sound engineer and Mike Noble was in a band called “The Hi Five” with Neville Whitmill long before The Square Set was formed\, but neither Ian or Mike were ever members of The Square Set\, as certain sources suggest.  In 1967 Keith was replaced by Don Robertson on drums\, and three months later Malcolm Postlethwaite in turn replaced Don. Don recorded “Carol Corina” with The Square Set in 1967\, while Malcolm recorded the follow-up Album “Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever' early in 1968. The remaining members remained the same throughout the years\, up until The Square Set split in August 1968.  When “That's What I Want” suddenly became popular 4 years later\, Nol and Neville reformed the band (late 1971)\, but Derek Marks didn't want to re-join\, therefore they employed Johnny Boshoff and Tony Moore to complete the third album “Those Many Feelings”. Mike Faure on sax joined the band on stage for about 3 months in 1968\, while Mercia Love was in the band from July 1967 to February 1968.  The Square Set had two South African Top 20 hits: 1. Carol Corina – 1967\, #15\, 5 weeks 2. Silence is golden – 1967\, #3\, 13 weeks  Neville Whitmiil also had two South African Top 20 hits as a solo artist: 1. Get me some help – 1971\, #2\, 18 weeks 2. Harmony – 1973\, #18\, 3 weeks   This song is off the album "Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever"\, released in 1968. It's a cover of a Chris Kenner song from 1961. COL channel name VAL keurspel (Leon Rossouw)	0

COPYRIGHTS RESERVED BY COPYRIGHT OWNER.This video is used only for non-profit usage and publishing. Gerard de Vries (Hilversum\, 19 augustus 1933) is een Nederlands zanger en diskjockey.Gerard de Vries is vooral bekend om zijn parlando-muziek\, waarin hij in de jaren zestig van de 20e eeuw enkele grote hits scoorde. Bekende hits van hem zijn Het spel kaarten uit 1965 en Giddy up go uit 1966. Veel van zijn nummers hebben het leven als vrachtwagenchauffeur  als onderwerp. Onder meer Giddy up go en Teddybeer zijn hier voorbeelden van. Vaak zijn deze nummers vertalingen van de populaire Amerikaanse zanger Red Sovine. Opvallend is dat de vertaalde nummers van De Vries niet rijmen\, terwijl die van Sovine dat wel doen. De hits over het leven als vrachtwagenchauffeur zijn in de regel verhalend. De nummers van De Vries hebben vaak een moraliserende ondertoon.Radio Veronica-medewerkers en diskjockeys Ad Bouman\, Hans Mondt\, Tom Collins\, Gerard de Vries en Klaas Vaak namen begin 1970 onder de naam De Binkies de carnavalshit  "Met carnaval" op. Het reikt niet verder dan de Tipparade.Naast zanger was Gerard de Vries diskjockey. Hij presenteerde aanvankelijk bij Radio Veronica onder het pseudoniem  Cowboy Gerard en later bij de TROS onder eigen naam. Gerard de Vries baarde opzien door als eerste diskjockey openlijk voor zijn homoseksualiteit uit te komen. In 1972 praatte hij over Les Cranes Engelse tekst heen op diens single "Desiderata". Het werd de B-kant van de in Nederland uitgebrachte single. Op dit moment is Gerard de Vries actief bij de lokale omroep in Wijdemeren\, Radio Wijdemeren.Na zijn carrière als zanger en diskjockey werd Gerard de Vries ondernemer in de paranormale branche.In 2007 was De Vries kort te zien in het 'datingspektakel' van (de Nederlandse versie van) het televisieprogramma Man bijt hond; hij had gereageerd op een oproep van kandidaat 'Gijs'\, die een man zocht. De Vries bood Gijs een zelfgeschreven boekje aan met de titel De Nederlandse taal. COL channel name VAL top401965	0

COL title VAL I Hear You Knockin COL performer VAL Showaddywaddy	COL video title VAL Bonnie Dobson - A taste of honey COL description VAL from the album 'Good Morning Rain' in 1970   By the time she moved permanently to London in 1970\, Canadian Bonnie Dobson had a pretty susbtantial career under her belt: four albums on the Prestige label including the song for which shes best known (Walk me out in the) Morning Dew plus two on RCA Victor.  Born in Toronto in 1940\, she got into folk seriously as a teenager on summer camps where people like Pete Seeger and Leon Bibb would turn up to give concerts. She got her break in 1960\, left university and started touring in the States.  I did my first tour with Brownie McGee and Sonny Terry who had been my idols and then I was playing with them\, she recalled in 1993. And then I went off to Los Angeles. There was a festival up in Idlewild\, the University of California had this arts festival every summer and I taught Canadian folk songs. I never got back to University. I just kept going and eventually I hit New York.  Grief over theft What followed were those six albums\, years of touring and lots of grief over her song Morning Dew being stolen by Tim Rose. In November 1969 she made her London debut at the Queen Elizabeth Hall\, and settled in the city the following year.   Lost Ladies of Folk She recorded just this one album for Argo\, then one for Polydor in 1976 (Morning Dew)\, followed by a few singles in the early eighties. Since then its been pretty much reissues\, retrospectives and compilations.  She had in fact called it quits I didnt feel I was growing\, I didnt feel I was doing anything. I just seemed to be doing the same things over and over again and I thought some people are happy to do that\, I wasnt. So I thought Ill go back and get my degree. Once back in the university world\, she stayed\, working as an administrator in the Philosophy Department of Birkbeck College\, London.  In 2007\, 28 years after she made her UK debut there\, she was persuaded back on to the stage at Queen Elizabeth Hall by Jarvis Cocker\, who was running a Lost Ladies of Folk night as part of his Meltdown curatorship. By all accounts she was on fine form. COL channel name VAL andrijadragon	0

Noone's playing is lyrical and sophisticated\, and certainly makes more use of "sweet" flavoring. Noone was an important influence on later clarinetists such as Artie Shaw and Benny Goodman. He started playing guitar in his home town and at the age of 15\, he switched to the clarinet and moved to New Orleans. He studied with Lorenzo Tio and with the young Sidney Bechet\, who was only 13 at the time. By 1912\, he was playing professionally with Kid Ory\, Papa Celestin\, the Eagle Band before joining the Original Creole Orchestra in Chicago in 1917. The following year\, he joined King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band\, then in 1926\, he started leading the band at Chicago's Apex Club\, the Jimmie Noone's Apex Club Orchestra\, in which the influential pianist Earl Hines was playing for a time. In  1943 he moved to Los Angeles\, where he died suddenly of a heart attack. The Kid Ory's band played for him the blues titled "Blues for Jimmie" on the radio\, and the number eventually became a regular feature for the Ory band. COL channel name VAL 240252	0

COL title VAL Just One Look COL performer VAL Shanes	COL video title VAL Sometimes I'm Happy COL description VAL O timbre aveludado e as interpretações delicadas da paulistana Marcia Lopes\, vem despertando reações calorosas de quem a ouve. Foi assim com Caetano Veloso\, Lulu Santos e até Bill Clinton\, que a acompanhou no sax durante uma reunião musical. Marcia estréia com estilo cantando um repertório de MPB mesclado com canções em inglês\, todo ele escolhido com muito critério pela própria cantora e arranjado com igual competência por Roberto Sion. Em português\, canções de Chico Buarque\, Edu Lobo\, Cristóvão Bastos\, Sueli Costa e Caetano Veloso. Em inglês\, Cole Porter\, James Taylor e Irving Ceasar. “Marcia parece que nasceu com a música. A emissão é muito calma\, muito límpida e tudo nas interpretações dela dá a impressão de boa música\, sem esforço\, tranqüila. A primeira coisa que a voz dela faz é produzir a nota. Isso é bom. Dá uma felicidade para quem está ouvindo. Fiquei realmente impressionado com a afinação precisa e o perfeito senso de medida em suas interpretações. Uma das mais belas vozes femininas.” COL channel name VAL Sounds Brasil	0

I own a copy of an old 'Now That's What I Call Music Video' VHS from the 1980s\, which I bought purely for this clip. As far as I am aware\, this is the only 'official' release of the video on VHS or DVD formatt. I have fixed the colour\, made the video a little sharper\, and I used the CD audio of the song to remaster the video's audio which was in mono and very muddy.  This video is a gem\, and as a huge Tina fan\, an excellent find. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I do. COL channel name VAL beyoncesmaw	1

COL title VAL Ode to Billy Joe COL performer VAL Gil Trythall	COL video title VAL Shirley Bassey - Blues In The Night (1957 Recording) COL description VAL 1957 (A young Shirley Bassey recorded this Johnny Mercer / Harold Arlen American Songbook Standard back in 1956 and it was released as a track on her first LP in 1957.  One of the songs from this LP\, 'Born To Sing The Blues' was released as a single in 1956.  Shirley has recorded & performed many genre's of music over her past 60+ years in show business due to her powerful voice & musical instincts\, but jazz & the blues were among the first that she mastered.  ABOUT this song: "Blues in the Night" is a popular song which has become a pop standard and is generally considered to be part of the Great American Songbook. The music was written by Harold Arlen\, the lyrics by Johnny Mercer\, for a 1941 film begun with the working title Hot Nocturne\, but finally released as Blues in the Night. The song is sung in the film by William Gillespie.  Arlen and Mercer wrote the entire score for the 1941 film Blues in the Night. One requirement was for a blues song to be sung in a jail cell. As usual with Mercer\, the composer wrote the music first\, then Mercer wrote the words. Arlen said\,   The whole thing just poured out. And I knew in my guts\, without even thinking what Johnny would write for a lyric\, that this was strong\, strong\, strong! When Mercer wrote "Blues in the Night"\, I went over his lyric and I started to hum it over his desk. It sounded marvelous once I got to the second stanza but that first twelve was weak tea. On the third or fourth page of his work sheets I saw some lines—one of them was "My momma done tol' me\, when I was in knee pants." I said\, "Why don't you try that?" It was one of the very few times I've ever suggested anything like that to John.  When they finished writing the song\, Mercer called a friend\, singer Margaret Whiting\, and asked if they could come over and play it for her. She suggested they come later because she had dinner guests—Mickey Rooney\, Judy Garland\, Mel Tormé\, and Martha Raye. Instead\, Arlen and Mercer went right over. Margaret Whiting remembered what happened then:   They came in the back door\, sat down at the piano and played the score of "Blues in the Night". I remember forever the reaction. Mel got up and said\, "I can't believe it." Martha couldn't say a word. Mickey Rooney said\, "That's the greatest thing I've ever heard." Judy Garland said\, "Play it again." We had them play it seven times. Judy and I ran to the piano to see who was going to learn it first. It was a lovely night.  A few of the great singers/musicians from the past who recorded this song were Ella Fitzgerald\, Frank Sinatra\, Rosemary Clooney\, Dinah Shore\, Judy Garland\, Bing Crosby\, Woody Herman\, Louis Armstrong\, Jo Stafford\, Doris Day\, Billy Eckstine\, Julie London\, Cab Calloway\, Kate Smith\, Van Morrison\, The Group Chicago\, and of course\, Shirley who was a teenager when she recorded it.   A few of the younger generation artists who have recorded this song include Amy Winehouse\, Eva Cassidy\, and Katie Melua.  ALL versions are Great\, because the song itself is a Classic for ALL generations!  LYRICS: My mama done tol' me\, when I was in pig tails My mama done tol' me\, " Child a man'll sweet talk" And give ya the big eye\, but when the sweet talkin's done A man is a two-face\, A worrisome thing who'll leave ya to sing the blues in the night  Now the rain's a-fallin'\, hear the train's a-callin\, "Whooee!" (My mama done tol' me) Hear dat lonesome whistle blowin' 'cross the trestle\, "Whooee!" (My mama done tol' me) A-whooee-ah-whooee ol' clickety-clack's a-echoin' back th' blues in the night  The evenin' breeze'll start the trees to cryin' and the moon'll hide its light when you get the blues in the night Take my word\, the mockingbird'll sing the saddest kind o' song\, he knows things are wrong\, and he's right  From Natchez to Mobile\, from Memphis to St. Joe\, wherever the four winds blow I been in some big towns an' heard me some big talk\, but there is one thing I know A man is a two-face\, a worrisome thing who'll leave ya to sing the blues in the night  Special Thanks to Pieter and Astrid from the Shirley Bassey blog and all those who have provided wonderful pictures of Shirley!

Sometimes the results were great\, sometimes bad. Freddy's (for some reason "Freddie" on the album cover) 1982 "Ramblin' Man" is actually somewhere in the middle for me. It's not bad\, but it's not great either. One of the more likable tracks to me was this one\, and he does a fine job with it! Enjoy! COL channel name VAL wilburscott	0

From Wikipedia\, the free encyclopedia  Oh Well were a UK dance group that started in the late 1980s. They were relatively successful during their peak in 1989\, but broke up soon after\, due to lack of chart success thereafter.  The group had two UK chart singles in 1989 and 1990: the eponymous "Oh Well" single was released in late 1989 and peaked at number 28 on the UK Singles Chart for two weeks\, starting on October 28. Their second single\, a cover of Golden Earring's "Radar Love"\, was released in early 1990 and debuted and peaked at number 63 on March 3.  The band can be referred to as a "one hit wonder"\, seeing as how they only had one single reach the Top 40. "Oh Well" was featured on Now That's What I Call Music! 16\, the sixteenth volume of the popular British hits series. COL channel name VAL 3Life3	0

COL title VAL I'm on Fire COL performer VAL Bat for Lashes	COL video title VAL Harry Edison & Eddie Lockjaw Davis-Simply Sweet-Feelings COL description VAL Trumpeter Harry "Sweets" Edison and tenor saxophonist Eddie "Lockjaw" Davis always made a potent pair. They both possessed immediately identifiable sounds\, were veterans of Count Basie's Orchestra and never had any difficulty swinging. The repertoire of this Edison album is not too creative with five blues among its eight songs and one of the others\, "Feelings\," being quite forgettable. However\, the playing of the principals (along with pianist Dolo Coker who also makes a couple of surprising appearances on electric keyboard) holds one's interest throughout.

COL title VAL Abide with Me COL performer VAL Vic Reeves	COL video title VAL Carl Smith No One Will Ever Know COL description VAL Success in the 1950s  In 1951\, his song "Let's Live a Little" was a big hit\, reaching No. 2 on country chart. During 1951 he had up three other hits\, including "If the Teardrops Were Pennies" and his first No. 1 hit\, "Let Old Mother Nature Have Her Way".  The songs made Smith a well-known name in country music. His band\, the Tunesmiths\, featured steel guitarist Johnny Silbert\, who added an element of Western swing.   In 1952\, Smith married June Carter (who later became the wife of Johnny Cash)\, the daughter of Maybelle Carter of the Carter Family. In 1955 the couple had a daughter\, Rebecca Carlene Smith\, who later became known as Carlene Carter\, a country singer in her own right.  During the rest of the 1950s\, Smith made regular appearances on Billboard's country charts\, racking up many hits\, including 30 in the Top 10. His biggest hits include "Loose Talk"\, "Wicked Lies"\, "Hey Joe!" and "You Are the One". He had five No. 1 hits in his career; "Loose Talk" was his last\, in 1955. "Hey Joe!" got to Number 1 in the UK Singles Chart for Frankie Laine in October 1953 for two weeks.  Some of his songs had sharp edges\, fast phrasing and a strong drumbeat\, similar to rockabilly material making the charts in the mid-50s\, which in some ways made Smith's music closer to rock and roll than country. Some of his songs did\, however\, make the pop charts. His biggest pop entry was the song "Ten Thousand Drums" in 1959\, which reached No. 43 on the pop chart.  In 1956\, Smith quit the Grand Ole Opry. Soon after\, he joined The Phillip Morris Country Music Show and spent more than a year touring the United States\, often in direct competition with touring Opry shows. He also made regular appearances on ABC-TV's Jubilee USA and was a fill-in host for Red Foley.  In 1957\, Smith and June Carter divorced. That same year\, he appeared in the movie\, The Badge of Marshal Brennan and Buffalo Guns\, and married country music singer Goldie Hill\, best known for the No. 1 hit "I Let the Stars Get In My Eyes". Goldie retired from the music business. By the late 50s\, Smith's success began to dwindle on the country charts\, and soon his string of Top 10s turned into Top 20 hits.

COL title VAL Suspicious Minds COL performer VAL Eilert Pilarm	COL video title VAL Leslie West - Tequila.wmv COL description VAL Leslie West - As Phat As It Gets (1999) He's half the man he used to be in terms of mass\, but when it comes to rock & roll\, just stand back and listen as the master holds court. The man who once recorded an album called The Great Fatsby is back\, slimmed down and kicking as hard as ever on tracks like "Palace of the King" and "Allergic." West comes out jamming\, backed by some pretty familiar names from the lexicon of classic rock\, including Joe Lynn Turner\, Kim Simmonds of Savoy Brown\, Popa Chubby\, and a little band called the Destroyers\, who take time away from their day job playing with a fella named George Thorogood. When West rips into the old blues standard "Stormy Monday\," it's take-no-prisoners electric blues\, and his covers of "Tequila" and Otis Redding's "Respect" are Mountain-ized. (Speaking of "Respect\," it's a little-known fact that West's first group\, the Vagrants\, had a version of that very same song out on a single in 1969 that was meant to be their key to the big time\, but when Atco issued Aretha Franklin's now-legendary version\, the Vagrants' record was blasted into obscurity.) "Raw Nerve" rocks with a real Billy Gibbons influence\, and "The Cell" is an infectious life-in-prison tune that's meant to be played loud. Actually\, the whole album sounds best with the volume knob set at 11. Oh\, and if you're looking for blues\, there's a ripsnorter penned by Leon Russell called "Me and My Guitar." "As Phat as It Gets" mixes the best elements of Frank Zappa\, Black Sabbath\, and Mountain into one smoldering tune about weight loss.  Tracklist  1. Saturation (I'm In Love With You)   (03:23) 2. The Cell   (04:13) 3. Allergic   (04:17) 4. Palace Of The King   (04:47) 5. Stormy Monday   (07:07) 6. I Can't Shake It   (04:12) 7. Tequila (  02:07) 8. Me And My Guitar   (04:55) 9.

COL title VAL Spooky COL performer VAL Michele Lee	COL video title VAL John Prine and Mac Wiseman -  Where the Blue Of The Night (2007) COL description VAL Composed by\, Fred E. Ahlert / Bing Crosby / Roy Turk From the Oh Boy! Records album - Standard Songs For Average People (2007) sound recording administered by:  IODA REVIEW: The title tells the story well enough on Standard Songs for Average People\, a set of 14 country-leaning classics interpreted by venerable singer/songwriter John Prine and bluegrass balladeer Mac Wiseman. While Prine has never possessed a classically strong voice\, he knows how to communicate a lyric well enough (even lyrics he didn't write himself)\, and it's clear that he loves the songs he's selected for this project (Prine also co-produced with David Ferguson). Whatever Prine may lack in vocal polish\, Wiseman easily brings to the table; if his voice is a bit sandier than it was years ago\, he can still make the weepers sound convincingly sad and the uptempo numbers bring a smile when he's singing. The arrangements and production recall the smooth but homey sound of Nashville's countrypolitan era\, and the pickers bring the songs across with a simple but impressive aplomb (especially Tom O'Brien on guitar and banjo and Joey Miskulin on accordion). And the songs...well\, certain songs become standards because they're so good almost no one can go wrong with them\, and on this set "I Love You Because\," "The Blue Side of Lonesome\," "Saginaw\, Michigan\," and "Old Rugged Cross" sound fresh and engaging\, even though you've probably heard them hundreds of time before. And while they may not be as well-known\, Tom T. Hall's "Old Dogs\, Children and Watermelon Wine\," Kris Kristofferson's "Just the Other Side of Nowhere\," and Bob Wills' "Don't Be Ashamed of Your Age" sure sound like classics coming from Prine and Wiseman. The craft is strong on Standard Songs for Average People\, but at its heart it sounds like two friends singing some old songs they love on a quiet evening\, and that's part of the album's strength -- these are 14 songs sung by two guys who know a great tune when they hear it\, and they allow these numbers to work their magic simply\, which serves them very well.

COL title VAL Summertime COL performer VAL Big Time Sarah and The BTS Express	COL video title VAL Toy Factory - Summertime (1970) COL description VAL Banda: Toy Factory Album: ST (1970) Origem: Estados Unidos Gravadora: AVCO Embassy - AVLP 7014   Though we haven't been able to track down much bibliographical information on this late-60s bi-racial outfit\, we think they were from Long Island\, New York. From the liner notes on their LP we can also tell you Greg Weiss was the lead singer and was responsible for writing roughly half the material. The rest of the line up consisted of bassist Bill\, guitarist Billy\, drummer Joey and keyboard player Sal (great detail there). Produced by Bernie Lawrence\, the majority of 1970's "Toy Factory" found the band trying to fight their way through rather faceless MOR pop. Lead singer Greg Weiss had a decent voice\, but on tracks such as "What Is Youth"\, "To Live or Die" and "Honey\, Forever" he employed an irritating faux-English accent that recalled Davy Jones (he sounds like David Hemmings to me Bad Cat!!!). He also had an irritating habit of throwing mock sobs and groans into the mix ("When I'm with You" and "Honey Forever"). Strike three were the occasional French lyrics (don't pick on the French Bad Cat!!!) he tossed into the mix ("To Live or Die" and "Honey Forever"). Curiously\, the band was at their best when they cut loose and go for a harder rock sound. In this case\, the pseudo-psychedelic "No Rhyme To Orange" (sporting a nice fuzz guitar solo) and "Things" was a nifty slice of blue-eyed soul. "Summertime" also found the band turning in one of the weirdest George Gershwin covers we've ever heard (pretty decent guitar here too Bad Cat!!!). This one certainly won't change your life\, but it's one of those period failures that's worth checking out. (Tyme Machine Blog) COL channel name VAL Melomano Discos	1

Her second Riverside session (and her third recording)\, It's Magic has been reissued on this CD in the Original Jazz Classics series. The backup musicians are among the best in jazz at the time (Kenny Dorham or Art Farmer on trumpet\, trombonist Curtis Fuller\, Benny Golson on tenor\, Jerome Richardson or Sahib Shihab on reeds\, pianist Wynton Kelly\, Paul Chambers or Sam Jones on bass\, and drummer Philly Joe Jones) and they have opportunities to play short solos. Lincoln is heard at her early best on such numbers as "I Am in Love\," "An Occasional Man\," "Out of the Past" and Randy Weston's "Little Niles." Recommended. COL channel name VAL OubaelPhoumet	0

COL title VAL Medley: I Only Have Eyes for You / Jeepers Creepers COL performer VAL Wesla Whitfield	COL video title VAL Erroll Garner Trio - I Only Have Eyes For You (Savoy Records 1949) COL description VAL "I Only Have Eyes for You" is a popular song by composer Harry Warren and lyricist Al Dubin\, written in 1934 for the film Dames where it was introduced by Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler.  Erroll Louis Garner (June 15\, 1921 -- January 2\, 1977) was an American jazz pianist and composer known for his swing playing and ballads. His best-known composition\, the ballad "Misty"\, has become a jazz standard. Allmusic.com calls him "one of the most distinctive of all pianists" and a "brilliant virtuoso".  Born with his twin brother Ernest in Pittsburgh\, Pennsylvania\, to an African American family on June 15\, 1921\, Erroll began playing piano at the age of three. His elder siblings were taught piano by Miss Bowman. From an early age Erroll would sit down and play anything she'd demonstrated\, just like Miss Bowman\, his eldest sister Martha said. He attended George Westinghouse High School\, as did fellow pianists Billy Strayhorn and Ahmad Jamal. Garner was self-taught and remained an "ear player" all his life – he never learned to read music. At the age of seven\, he began appearing on the radio station KDKA in Pittsburgh with a group called the Candy Kids. By the age of 11\, he was playing on the Allegheny riverboats. At 14 in 1937\, he joined local saxophonist Leroy Brown.  He played locally in the shadow of his older pianist brother Linton Garner and moved to New York in 1944. He briefly worked with the bassist Slam Stewart\, and though not a bebop musician per se\, in 1947 played with Charlie Parker on the famous "Cool Blues" session. Although his admission to the Pittsburgh music union was initially refused because of his inability to read music\, they eventually relented in 1956 and made him an honorary member. Garner is credited with having a superb memory of music. After attending a concert by the Russian classical pianist Emil Gilels\, Garner returned to his apartment and was able to play a large portion of the performed music by recall.  Short in stature (5 ft 2 in)\, Garner performed sitting on multiple telephone directories.] Considering that his small hands could barely span an octave on the piano keyboard\, his rapid right-handed octave and chordal passages were all the more amazing. He was also known for his vocalizations while playing\, which can be heard on many of his recordings. He helped to bridge the gap for jazz musicians between nightclubs and the concert hall.  Garner made many tours both at home and abroad\, and produced a large volume of recorded work. He was\, reportedly\, The Tonight Show host Johnny Carson's favorite jazz musician\, appearing on Carson's show many times over the years.  Garner's first recordings were made in late 1944 at the apartment of Timme Rosenkrantz; these were subsequently issued as the five-volume Overture to Dawn series on Blue Note Records. His recording career advanced in the late 1940s when several sides such as "Fine and Dandy" and "Sweet 'n' Lovely" were cut. His 1955 live album Concert by the Sea was a best-selling jazz album in its day and features Eddie Calhoun on bass and Denzil Best on drums. This recording of a performance at the Sunset Center\, a former school in Carmel-by-the-Sea\, California\, was made using relatively primitive sound equipment\, but for George Avakian the decision to release the recording was easy. Other works include 1951's Long Ago and Far Away and 1974's Magician\, both of which see Garner perform a number of classic standards. Often the trio was expanded to add Latin percussion\, usually a conga.  In 1964\, Garner appeared in the UK on the music series Jazz 625 broadcast on the BBC's new second channel. The programme was hosted by Steve Race\, who introduced Garner's trio with Eddie Calhoun on bass and Kelly Martin on drums. Because Garner could not write down his musical ideas\, he used to record them on tape\, to be later transcribed by others.  Erroll Garner died from a cardiac arrest on January 2\, 1977. He is buried in Pittsburgh's Homewood Cemetery.  Erroll's accompanied by John Simmons (bass) and Alvin Stoller (drums).  Recorded in Los Angeles\, March 29\, 1949.

COL title VAL Wonderwall COL performer VAL Ryan Adams	COL video title VAL Oh Well - Oh Well COL description VAL No one knows who these guys are\, so I thought I'd post their songs. From Wikipedia\, the free encyclopedia  Oh Well were a UK dance group that started in the late 1980s. They were relatively successful during their peak in 1989\, but broke up soon after\, due to lack of chart success thereafter.  The group had two UK chart singles in 1989 and 1990: the eponymous "Oh Well" single was released in late 1989 and peaked at number 28 on the UK Singles Chart for two weeks\, starting on October 28. Their second single\, a cover of Golden Earring's "Radar Love"\, was released in early 1990 and debuted and peaked at number 63 on March 3.  The band can be referred to as a "one hit wonder"\, seeing as how they only had one single reach the Top 40. "Oh Well" was featured on Now That's What I Call Music! 16\, the sixteenth volume of the popular British hits series. COL channel name VAL 3Life3	0

COL title VAL Wreck of the Old 97 COL performer VAL The Osborne Brothers	COL video title VAL Terence Boylan - Alias Boona (1969) COL description VAL Brought up in Buffalo\, New York\, Terence Boylan first appeared on local radio in the late 1950s performing a song he had written at the age of 11. While still in his mid teens\, in the early 1960s\, he performed in Greenwich Village and\, following a chance meeting with Bob Dylan\, was encouraged to pursue a solo music career in upstate New York. He attended Bard College in New York\, and with his older brother John formed a band\, the Ginger Men. By 1967\, they had both signed with Verve Records\, for whom they then recorded an experimental concept album\, Playback\, issued in the name of the Appletree Theatre.  After John Boylan moved to California\, Terence stayed in New York\, returned to college\, and played with classmates Walter Becker and Donald Fagen. With them\, he cut a solo LP\, Alias Boona in 1969\, the title referring to his nickname. He then moved to California\, working again with his brother. After a few years he was signed to Asylum Records\, and recorded his self-titled second album in 1977. Like his previous record\, this was well received by critics but was never more than a cult success. However\, Boylan did enjoy some success as a songwriter when Iain Matthews turned his song "Shake It" into a top five hit.  01. Subterranean Homesick Blues 02. Don't Blame It On Your Wife 03.

Arthur Ferrante  (7 de septiembre de 1921\, Nueva York - 19 de septiembre de 2009)\, y Louis Teicher (24 de agosto de 1924\, Wilkes-Barre\, Pennsylvania  - 3 de agosto de 2008) se conocieron mientras estudiaban en la Escuela Juilliard de Música de Nueva York.

En 1947\, comenzaron a dedicarse por completo al mundo de la música y rápidamente empiezan a ascender  tocando música clásica con respaldo orquestal.

COL title VAL Basin Street Blues COL performer VAL Hadda Brooks Trio	COL video title VAL David Bromberg - Dehlia (Live) with Lyrics COL description VAL Bromberg's site: http://www.davidbromberg.net/ for his cd's\, tour dates\, & info.  The perfect blues song. A slow sad ballad which tells a story. You have to listen. Harp comes in at 3:48 and adds an even sadder note to the song. Gorgeous music. Lyrics by Blind Willie McTell and a story told so well by David Bromberg on his first album\, "David Bromberg" released in 1972. The haunting harp and story David tells adds to this perfect mix. I know you will enjoy!  Lyrics modified between the two versions. David sings most of them\, but perhaps in a different order:  Delia was a gambling girl\, she gambled all around. Yes\, she was a gambling girl\, she would lay her money down. She's all I've got\, is gone.  Delia's dear old mother\, she took a trip out West. When she returned\, little Delia had gone to rest. She's all I've got\, is gone.  Delia's mama weeped. Delia's daddy mourned. It wouldn't have been so bad\, good people\, if the poor girl had died at home. She's all I've got\, is gone.  Curtis is looking high\, and Curtis looking low. He shot poor Delia down\, good people\, with a big bore forty four. She's all I've got.  High up on the house tops\, as high as I could see\, Looking for those rounders\, who were looking out for me. She's all I've got.  Now you can call out your rubber tired taxis and your double seated hacks\,  They took poor Dehlia to the graveyard\, well they failed to bring her back. She's all I got\, is gone.  Judge he said to Curtis\, what's this noise about? It's all about them rounders\, they're trying to cut me out. She's all I've got\, is gone.  Curtis said to the judge\, what may be my fine? The judge says "Poor boy\, you've got ninety nine." She's all I've got\, is gone.  Curtis is in the jailhouse\, drinking from an old tin cup. Delia's in the graveyard boy\, she may not never get up. She's all I've got. is gone.  COMMENTARY BY DAVID BROMBERG ABOUT THIS IS PROBABLY A JAIL HOUSE SONG BEING SUNG BY CURTIS. HE MENTIONS HE LEARNED THIS IS THE BLIND WILLIE MCTELL VERSION.  Delia\, Delia\, how could it be? You loved all those rounders\, you never really did love me. She's all I've got.  Delia\, Delia\, how could it be? You loved those rounders\, but you never really did love me. She's all I've got\, is gone.  There are at least TWO versions of this song. Lyrics written by Blind Willie for one version and by Rev. Gary Davis for the second version. Johnny Cash sang Delia's Gone by Davis (the second version). I checked out some info and there was a Dehlia killed by a "Curtis" in 1901\, but the girl was only 14 and she got into a fight with her young boyfriend. He shot her. If it is the same Dehlia\, a lot of poetic license was taken. The other facts all fit...paragraphs and paragraphs of facts. COL channel name VAL MyMoppet52	0

A founding member of the group was Dionne Warwick\, who was later replaced by her aunt\, Cissy Houston. The Sweet Inspirations was founded by former members of The Drinkard Singers\, a long-running Gospel singing group whose membership included Cissy Houston (née Drinkard\, and mother of Whitney Houston\, 1963) and Lee Warwick\, who was Cissy's sister and the mother of Sweet Inspirations members Dee Dee and Dionne Warwick). As a backup group\, the Sweet Inspirations were in high demand among producers\, publishers\, artists\, and songwriters in the early 1960s. The original lineup included Doris Troy and the two Warwick sisters Dionne & Dee Dee. Sylvia Shemwell (sister of Judy Clay) replaced Troy\, while Cissy Houston took over from Dionne\, with Dee Dee Warwick as the group's official leader. The group sang backup for many stars\, including Solomon Burke\, Aretha Franklin\, Wilson Pickett\, and Esther Phillips. Dee Dee left in 1965\, when her solo career began to take off. She was replaced by Myrna Smith. Estelle Brown joined the team soon after\, and the line-up that was to become an Atlantic recording group was set. The Sweet Inspirations recorded by themselves for the first time in April 1967 for Atlantic Records. That session produced the first two singles released by Atlantic\, a version of "Why (Am I Treated So Bad)\," a song previously recorded by The Staple Singers and a soulful version of "Let It Be Me"\, a French song which had been a pop and R&B hit for Betty Everett & Jerry Butler in 1964.

COL title VAL I Heard It Through the Grapevine COL performer VAL Antonio Forcione	COL video title VAL Ray Johnson - I Heard It Through The Grapevine (Smokey Robinson & The Miracles Cover) COL description VAL From '' Funky Way '' Label: Inarts Records -- IA 107 Format: Vinyl\, 7"\, 45 RPM Country: US  Tracklist A Funky Way   B I Heard It Through The Grapevine    Producer -- Fred Darian  ------------------------  "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" is a landmark song in the history of Motown Records. Written by Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong in 1966\, the single was first recorded by Smokey Robinson & the Miracles. Released on September 25\, 1967 as Soul 35039 by Gladys Knight & the Pips who recorded the third version of the song\, it has since become a signature song for singer Marvin Gaye\, who recorded his version of the song prior to the Pips' but released it after theirs on October 30\, 1968 as Tamla 54176. Creedence Clearwater Revival released their version of the song in 1970.  Gaye's version has since become a landmark in pop music. In 2004\, it ranked No.80 on Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. On the commemorative 50th Anniversary of the Billboard Hot 100 issue of Billboard magazine in June 2008\, Gaye's version was ranked as the 65th biggest song on the chart.  Early recordings  In 1966\, Barrett Strong\, a former recording artist for Motown Records and the singer behind the label's breakthrough hit\, "Money (That's What I Want)"\, had begun to work in the songwriting staff after failing to produce a follow-up hit. Motown CEO Berry Gordy hired Strong to work with Norman Whitfield to work on recordings for The Temptations following the success of Whitfield's recording of the group's "Ain't Too Proud to Beg". Strong originally composed "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" due to his own personal relationship. Whitfield began collaborating with Strong on the song and eventually decided to record it with The Miracles\, who recorded the song on August 6\, 1966. Due to Gordy's strong veto power during Motown's annual Friday meetings at Hitsville USA's Quality Control Department\, the Miracles' version was deemed unreleasable. Gordy thought the song was "horrible" and advised Whitfield and Strong to create a stronger single\, however the duo refused to budge. Years later\, a second version by The Miracles\, with a similar arrangement to their first version\, appeared as an album track on their 1968 Special Occasion LP. Their original recording was issued years later on a compilation album entitled Motown Sings Motown Treasures.  Other notable covers and references in media  Following Marvin Gaye's 1968 release of the single\, his version has been frequently covered by artists of varied genres. In 1969\, Whitfield produced a version for The Temptations for their hit album\, Cloud Nine though their version recalled The Pips'. In 1971\, The Undisputed Truth became the final Motown act to record the song in its Marvin-styled version. The song was also covered by The Chi-Lites on their 1969 debut album Give It Away.  Creedence Clearwater Revival recorded an eleven-minute version for their album\, Cosmo's Factory\, released in 1970. Other versions have been recorded in other genres such as punk rock where the UK-based The Slits recorded a heavily dub version as a b-side of their first single recording it in the Marvin Gaye version. Other groups such as Tuxedomoon\, The Crust Brothers and the disco band\, P'Zzazz\, featuring Mildred Vancy on vocals\, also recorded the song.  In 1981\, funk musician Roger Troutman\, released a cover of the song in an extended version off his debut solo project\, The Many Facets of Roger. Troutman's version brought the song back to number one on the R&B chart in early 1982 marking the third time the single reached the top spot on that chart. It also made the Billboard Hot 100\, peaking at number seventy-nine. During the 1990s\, the song is heard briefly in the movie Friday.  In 1986\, several studio singers re-recorded the song and featured it in a commercial for the clay-animated singing group The California Raisins. Their version became their signature tune\, mainly due to a pun on the fact that raisins originate from "the grapevine."  Other artists to have recorded the song have included Trini Lopez\, the Soultans and the Flying Pickets\, the Doug Anthony All Stars\, Giorgia\, Marisa Monte\, Kaiser Chiefs\, Michael Chapdelaine\, Paul Weller and Amy Winehouse in a duet version while performing on Jools Holland\, The Robustos\, Tina Turner\, Elton John\, Diana DeGarmo\, Michael McDonald\, Birds of Tokyo\, Craig David and Fairport Convention in a live version with vocals by Richard Thompson.  A humorous cover of the song was recorded by Paul Shanklin for the album\, Bill Clinton: The Early Years\, based on former President Bill Clinton. Antonio Forcione recorded an instrumental version on his live album. Queen Latifah used the song in Gaye's version as a basis for her 1998 single Paper\, produced by Pras Michel for her album Order in the Court.  Marvin Gaye's version has been featured in films including The Big Chill (1983) and Remember the Titans (2001) and was featured in the 2008 play\, The Big Payback. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	1

It appears on the album Freedom of Choice. There were two 7" single releases of "Whip It"\, one backed with a remix of the track "Snowball" (which appears on Freedom of Choice) and one backed with "Turn Around" (a song later covered by Nirvana).  "Whip It" was Devo's biggest hit\, and peaked at number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart\, number three on the Canadian Singles Chart and number 77 on the Australian Singles Chart (Kent Music Report).  It is ranked #62 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of the '80s as well as #15 on the same channel's 100 Greatest One Hit Wonders of the '80s  Song information  "Whip It" is built on a motorik beat\, similar to tracks by Neu!. The lead instrument is a Minimoog synthesizer. The bass is performed with a custom six oscillator synthesizer\, custom made by Moog Music for Devo. The whip sound was made with an EML ElectroComp 500 synthesizer.  On an episode of the VH1 show TrueSpin\, Gerald V. Casale revealed that the lead guitar riff from "Whip It" is based on the riff from "Oh\, Pretty Woman" by Roy Orbison with the beat moved to the back.  Gerald Casale told Songfacts that the lyrics were written by him "as an imitation of Thomas Pynchon's parodies in his book Gravity's Rainbow." The lyrics evoke a working class desire to pull oneself up and to overcome adversity. The song has violent undertones\, and Devo has often described it as about Jimmy Carter\, as Mothersbaugh describes in an interview on To The Best of our Knowledge. However\, many people took the lyrics at face value\, interpreting the song as a paean to masturbation and sadomasochism\, or a reference to inhaling nitrous oxide from whipped cream cans (taken from the name "whip-it"\, used to describe the nitrous chargers for whipped cream dispensers).  "Whip It" debuted at a live concert on December 29th\, 1979 in Santa Cruz\, California. The first performance included a synthesizer solo taken from the early Devo song "Chango." This performance was recorded and is available as a bootleg. A demo version was recorded in 1980 and later released in 2000 on the compilation Recombo DNA released by Rhino Handmade.  Music video  Devo funded the music video for "Whip It" with $15\,000 USD of their own money. The main visual of the video\, Mark Mothersbaugh whipping the clothes off a woman\, was inspired by an article in a 1962 issue of "Dude" magazine. In an interview for Songfacts\, Casale explains "There was a feature article on a guy who had been an actor and fell on hard times\, he wasn't getting parts anymore. He moved with his wife to Arizona\, opened a dude ranch and charged people money to come hang out at the ranch. Every day at noon in the corral\, for entertainment\, he'd whip his wife's clothes off with a 12-foot bullwhip. She sewed the costumes and put them together with Velcro. The story was in the magazine about how good he was and how he never hurt her. We had such a big laugh about it\, we said\, 'OK\, that's the basis for the video. We'll have these cowboys drinking beer and cheering Mark on as he's in the barnyard whipping this pioneer woman's clothes off while the band plays in the corral.'"  In the video\, Devo wears black\, sleeveless turtlenecks\, and their famous Energy Dome headgear. When the video begins\, all the members\, except for Mark Mothersbaugh\, wear the turtlenecks pulled over their faces. During the performance\, each member lowers the turtleneck. Robert Mothersbaugh ("Bob 1") plays a Moog Liberation keytar\, Robert Casale ("Bob 2") plays a red Rheem Kee Bass\, and Alan Myers plays a set of Synare electronic drum pads.  Not surprisingly\, the S&M overtones of the video caused controversy. Devo was forced to abandon a television appearance after the host deemed the video offensive to women. Despite this\, "Whip It" received heavy rotation on MTV after its introduction in 1981. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

I own a copy of an old 'Now That's What I Call Music Video' VHS from the 1980s\, which I bought purely for this clip. As far as I am aware\, this is the only 'official' release of the video on VHS or DVD formatt. I have fixed the colour\, made the video a little sharper\, and I used the CD audio of the song to remaster the video's audio which was in mono and very muddy.  This video is a gem\, and as a huge Tina fan\, an excellent find. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I do. COL channel name VAL beyoncesmaw	0

Julian is a real interesting Toronto based singer & piano player.  His blues style is more of a traditional 'pre-war barrelhouse blues & boogie-woogie with infusions of gospel & jazz'.  I really love how he tells a story with his music.  He plays quite often in the Toronto area so check him out if you can.

COL title VAL Senza fine COL performer VAL Gino Paoli	COL video title VAL Gerry Gibbs - 2015 - Live In Studio - 07 Alfie COL description VAL Personnel Kenny Barron: piano Ron Carter: acoustic bass Gerry Gibbs: drums Roy Hargrove: trumpet\, flugelhorn  Composers Burt Bacharach H. David  Drummer Gerry Gibbs has been living a recurring dream with slight variations for the past few years. In December of 2012\, he laid down tracks with two of his idols—the legendary Ron Carter and the estimable Kenny Barron—and dubbed their group the Thrasher Dream Trio. The eponymous debut from that band\, featuring fifteen tracks recorded at those sessions\, was\, not surprisingly\, a strong and classy affair filled with standards\, some originals\, and other jazz-friendly fare\, such as Stevie Wonder's "Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing" and Burt Bacharach's "Promises\, Promises."   At the time of that album's release\, those last-mentioned tracks could simply be viewed as part of the well-rounded program. But looking back now\, it actually seems like they were dropped as hints of what was to come. About a year-and-a-half after that first Thrasher Dream Trio album was recorded\, Gibbs brought the band together again to lay things down for We're Back (Whaling City Sound\, 2014)\, a jazz-does-R&B project with A-list guests—vibraphonist Warren Wolf\, saxophonist Steve Wilson\, and organist Larry Goldings. That album offered multiple helpings of Wonder and Earth\, Wind & Fire along with single servings of Bacharach\, Marvin Gaye\, Miles Davis\, and the Average White Band. As on the trio's first album\, the sparks were flying. The playing field\, however\, had changed a bit.   For this\, the third go-around for this group\, Gibbs does it again\, tweaking the formula without altering the essence of the trio. This time he turned the focus toward pop-ish material from the '50s and '60s—the work of Bacharach\, Henry Mancini\, Michel Legrand\, and others of that ilk—and put an audience in front of the band\, recording live at Systems Two Recording Studio. Guests are part of the package again—now it's trumpeter Roy Hargrove and vocalist Cassandra Wilson\, each appearing on a few tracks—and they help to add another wrinkle or two to the project without drawing focus away from the trio.   The album opens on a fluid "Wives And Lovers" that allows Barron's lyricism to shine through\, gives Carter a chance to step into the spotlight\, and puts Gibbs' brushwork at center stage. From there\, the trio moves on with an unusually upbeat take on "The Summer Knows\," a Wilson-enhanced version of "The Look Of Love" that moves from bossa nova to swing\, and a variety of other familiar hits of yesteryear. Hargrove joins in for "On A Clear Day\," quoting Ellington at one point and playfully trading solos with Gibbs; Vince Guaraldi's cheerfulness shines through on a perky trio performance of his "Cast Your Fate To The Wind"; "More" is transformed from a stale confection into an enjoyable swinger; and "Watch What Happens" happens twice—first as a cheerful\, Brazilian-based instrumental\, then as a swing-centered feature for Wilson.   Along the way there are plenty of other bright spots—an appropriately noir-ish "What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life?" with Hargrove on flugelhorn\, a leisurely stroll through "Girl Talk"—and plenty of moments that serve as simple reminders as to why Barron and Carter are loved\, respected\, and emulated the world over. Their time and taste are impeccable\, and when married to Gibbs' in-the-tradition drumming\, you know the music is going to go in the right direction every time.

COL title VAL Round Midnight COL performer VAL Maisa	COL video title VAL Chaka  Khans "Round Midnight!!!!!!!!!!!! COL description VAL ClassiKhan From Wikipedia\, the free encyclopedia ClassiKhan  Studio album by Chaka Khan Released October 5\, 2004 Genre Vocal\, Jazz Label Sanctuary Records (U.K.) Earthsong / AgU Music Group (U.S.) JVC Victor (Japan) Producer Ira Schickman Eve Nelson Chaka Khan Professional reviews Allmusic  [1] Chaka Khan chronology Dance Classics of Chaka Khan (1999) ClassiKhan (2004) The Platinum Collection (2006) ClassiKhan is the twelfth studio album by American R&B/funk singer Chaka Khan\, featuring the London Symphony Orchestra\, Produced and arranged by Eve Nelson and released in 2004 on the at the time still independent label Sanctuary Records in the U.K.\, on Earthsong/AgU Music Group in the U.S. and in 2005 also in Japan on JVC Victor. As Allmusic point out in their review\, with Khan's well-known affinity and acclaim for interpreting jazz standards in mind\, which through most of her career on the Warner Bros. label had been relegated to the backburner\, an album with the title ClassiKhan could at first glance very easily be mistaken for being a belated sequel to 1982's Echoes of an Era. While the album indeed does focus on jazz and swing standards like "Stormy Weather"\, "Hazel's Hips"\, "Round Midnight" and "Teach Me Tonight" it also features an eclectic selection of classics from other genres\, like pop culture favourites such as Broadway show tune "Hey Big Spender" from the musical Sweet Charity\, Peggy Lee's "Is That All There Is?" penned by Leiber & Stoller and even a 60's country and western classic in the form of Patsy Cline's "Crazy"\, written by Willie Nelson. ClassiKhan also features the themes of classic film favourites from Khan's youth\, "To Sir With Love" and the James Bond themes "Goldfinger" and "Diamonds Are Forever". The collection concludes with one new composition\, the ballad "I Believe"\, co-written by Khan and the album's producer Ira Shickman. The title ClassiKhan is naturally also a reference to Khan's accompaniment on the set. On the Echoes of an Era album it was a five-piece all-star jazz ensemble\, on ClassiKhan it is The New York All Star Musicians - but with the addition of the full London Symphony Orchestra\, conducted and arranged by Eve Nelson and with orchestrations by producer Ira Schickman and Gary Anderson. The album was mainly recorded at London's legendary Abbey Road Studios and it features guest appearances by among others pianist Joe Sample and percussionist Sheila E.\, best known for her work with Prince. ClassiKhan was both a critical and commercial success\, even reaching #42 on Billboard's R&B albums chart. COL channel name VAL ChakaFanTV	1

COL title VAL I'll Remember April COL performer VAL The Ramsey Lewis Trio	COL video title VAL Toy Factory - Summertime (1970) COL description VAL Banda: Toy Factory Album: ST (1970) Origem: Estados Unidos Gravadora: AVCO Embassy - AVLP 7014   Though we haven't been able to track down much bibliographical information on this late-60s bi-racial outfit\, we think they were from Long Island\, New York. From the liner notes on their LP we can also tell you Greg Weiss was the lead singer and was responsible for writing roughly half the material. The rest of the line up consisted of bassist Bill\, guitarist Billy\, drummer Joey and keyboard player Sal (great detail there). Produced by Bernie Lawrence\, the majority of 1970's "Toy Factory" found the band trying to fight their way through rather faceless MOR pop. Lead singer Greg Weiss had a decent voice\, but on tracks such as "What Is Youth"\, "To Live or Die" and "Honey\, Forever" he employed an irritating faux-English accent that recalled Davy Jones (he sounds like David Hemmings to me Bad Cat!!!). He also had an irritating habit of throwing mock sobs and groans into the mix ("When I'm with You" and "Honey Forever"). Strike three were the occasional French lyrics (don't pick on the French Bad Cat!!!) he tossed into the mix ("To Live or Die" and "Honey Forever"). Curiously\, the band was at their best when they cut loose and go for a harder rock sound. In this case\, the pseudo-psychedelic "No Rhyme To Orange" (sporting a nice fuzz guitar solo) and "Things" was a nifty slice of blue-eyed soul. "Summertime" also found the band turning in one of the weirdest George Gershwin covers we've ever heard (pretty decent guitar here too Bad Cat!!!). This one certainly won't change your life\, but it's one of those period failures that's worth checking out. (Tyme Machine Blog) COL channel name VAL Melomano Discos	0

In 1947\, she was performing in concert in New Orleans with Gayten\, when the latter asked the young Fats Domino to come and play "Swanee River Boogie" on stage.[5] Recording for both the Regal and De Luxe labels between 1947 and 1950\, Laurie sang on several sides backed by Gayten's orchestra. Her first success was with her version of "Since I Fell for You" (1947)\, of which recording studio owner Cosimo Matassa said: "Annie Laurie did the first really good record that I liked... [She] was just fantastic\, I mean nobody will ever make another version like that."[6] She followed its success up with "Cuttin' Out" (1949)\, "You Ought To Know" (1950)\, "I Need Your Love" (1950)\, "Now That You're Gone" (1950) and "I'll Never Be Free (1950)."[1][7] Laurie also toured with Gayten's orchestra in 1951.[4][7]  Laurie's association with Regal Records ended in 1951\, and she started recording for Okeh. By 1956 her releases were issued on Savoy Records\, for whom she recorded in New York with Hal Singer's orchestra\, featuring guitarist Mickey Baker.[8][4] Her biggest hit came in 1957 when De Luxe Records released "It Hurts to Be in Love\,"[1] which was co-written by Julius Dixson and Rudy Toombs.[9] Other releases with De Luxe included the Andy Gibson co-written track\, "Hand in Hand" and "Love Is A Funny Thing (both 1957).[10][11] In July 1960\, Laurie appeared in concert\, sharing the bill with Screamin' Jay Hawkins\, the Five Satins\, Joe Turner\, Faye Adams\, Ben E. King\, and Nappy Brown\, at Chicago's Regal Theater.[12] The same month she had her final chart hit with "If You're Lonely."[2]  By 1962\, her affiliation had switched to Ritz Records\,[4] and she recorded several sides for them.[1]  However she left the music industry at this time\, devoting herself to the Jehovah's Witnesses COL channel name VAL AMNON SUODAI	0

COL title VAL Be My Baby COL performer VAL Ultima Thule	COL video title VAL Talk To Me Talk To Me-Jean DuShon-'1961-Atco 6198.wmv COL description VAL Jean DuShon was born in Detroit\, Michigan. As a young girl\, she sang in church and dreamed of the day that she'd become a professional singer. After winning many talent shows\, she suddenly found herself singing in local nightclubs and was described as "the girl who sounds like Dinah Washington." Miss Washington\, herself\, heard about the singer\, who was already headling at the Baby Grand\, and decided to confront the youngster.  DuShon was so frightened after the Washington encounter\, that she immediately found her own style\, which was distinctive and true to her own personality.  As her reputation grew\, John Levy\, the famed agent who managed the likes of Nancy Wilson\, Dakota Staton\, George Shearing\, Cannonball Adderly and many others\, added Jean to his roster of stars. She was booked into swank clubs around the country and was suddenly being mentioned along side the other great female jazz singers like Ella Fitzgerald and Carmen McRae.  After Levy left Chicago for California\, with Wilson in tow\, DuShon's husband became her manager. Jean sang as star vocalist with Cootie Williams Band\, had a short stint with Lloyd Price's group and was asked to join the legendary Fats Domino\, who took her to Las Vegas where they shared the bill at the famed Flamingo Hotel.  While appearing at the Roundtable in New York\, Jean was spotted by Ahmet Ertegun of Atlantic Records. He was so impressed with DuShon that he took her to his company and paired her with the young Phil Spector. Spector guided DuShon through several recordings including a rehash of Little Willie John's "Talk To Me."  DuShon recorded for several labels including Okeh (Columbia)\, Lenox\, ABC Paramount and finally settled at Chess Records out of Chicago\, where she recorded three albums: "Make Way For Jean DuShon\," "You Better Believe Me" (with Ramsey Lewis Trio) and "Feeling Good\," which was arranged and conducted by the legendary\, Oliver Nelson. It is not well-known\, but Jean DuShon was the very first singer to record the classic\, "For Once in My Life."  Miss DuShon found herself on the New York stage (off-Broadway) in several plays and then headed to Broadway and starred in "What The Wine Selles Buy" with Dick Anthony Williams and Glynn Turman\, "Bubbling Brown Sugar" with Cab Calloway and "Blues in the Night" with Leslie Uggams. DuShon received glowing reviews for her performances and in "Blues\," brought down the house singing Bessie Smith's tragic "Wasted Life Blues." Later\, she took over for Odetta in the Chicago musical\, "Little Dreamer - A Night in the Life of Bessie Smith\," which ran for over a year. While in Chicago\, she starred in the PBS musical production called "Precious Memories - Strolling Down 47th Street."  Jean found time to record with Brother Jack McDuff in the 1970s ("The Fourth Dimension\," "Moon Rappin'"). Presently\, Miss DuShon is preparing a one-woman show\, which she plans to take on the road and hopefully\, present the show on Broadway. Also\, she is ready to record again! Jean lives in NYC.

Singing songs and a carrying signs\, Mostly saying hooray for our side.  It's time we stop\, hey what's that sound\, Everybody look what's going down.

COL title VAL Handsome Molly COL performer VAL G.B. Grayson & Henry Whitter	COL video title VAL The Holly and the Ivy COL description VAL “The Holly and the Ivy”\, this distinctive\, ancient\, British carol is heard on Allison Crowe’s new Christmas collection\, “Souling”.  http://music.allisoncrowe.com/album/souling  Allison Crowe’s gorgeous voice brings tidings of comfort and joy with “Souling” – her 11th full album release.  The artist\, one of our greatest living musicians\, singer-songwriters and performers\, has always created authentic music.  With this newest song set her voice is heard wholly a cappella.  The songs themselves have a purity of expression – a 21st century take on music of faith and spirit – sounds and themes aired by carollers and soulers of old.  The genesis of “Souling” is found in the bond Allison Crowe’s formed with the creative family at Theatre Newfoundland and Labrador. Founded in 1979\, this professional theatre company presents a dynamic and diverse repertoire of plays and maintains\, as well\, a strong commitment to youth theatre in the Atlantic Canada community.  For these past three Summers TNL’s engaged Crowe as Musical Director of “Newfoundland Vinyl” - a perennial favourite at the annual Gros Morne Theatre Festival. Following another hit season at GMTF\, in late August of this year TNL Artistic Associate SaraH McDonald invited the Corner Brook\, NL-based musician to serve the same role with a vibrant production of “A Christmas Carol”.  The Adaptation of this classic Charles Dickens story by playwright Jeff Pitcher\, TNL’s Artistic Director\, excited Crowe’s musical imagination – as did the desire of McDonald\, the play’s Director\, to incorporate songs in the style of Victorian Era carollers.  So inspired\, Allison Crowe immersed herself in curating the music for the abundantly-talented\, multi-aged\, choir of singers who performed in “A Christmas Carol” at the Corner Brook Arts and Culture Centre from November 27th – 30th\, 2014.  This artistic process of selection and arrangement led to her recording solo versions of those songs that will receive another distinct breath of life from the TNL vocal ensemble.  (In parallel fashion\, the first season’s run of “Newfoundland Vinyl” brought forth Allison Crowe’s album of the same name – one of 2013’s top recordings. Culture blog Muruch praised it as a “lovely\, vintage collection of traditional Irish and Canadian folk ballads\, lively sea chanteys and drinking songs\, parlour songs and country tunes” possessing “unique charm” and “the timeless beauty of a classic folk album”.)  In 2003\, (and expanded in 2004)\, Allison Crowe released Tidings – an album of singular interpretations - “River” (Joni Mitchell)\, “Hallelujah” (Leonard Cohen)\, “In My Life” (The Beatles) and more from the secular canon – alongside such favourite traditional carols as “Silent Night”\, “The First Noel”\, and “O Holy Night”. Tidings has proven to be a modern classic – “music for the season and all time”.  This time out\, as befits TNL’s telling of “A Christmas Carol”\, Allison Crowe gives pure voice to the sacred songbook. “Souling” is:  Soul Cake I Saw Three Ships That Night in Bethlehem (Don Oíche úd i mBeithil) God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen The Wexford Carol The Holly and the Ivy In the Bleak Midwinter (Cranham) Ding Dong Merrily on High Once in Royal David’s City Wassail Song  “Souling” is available now via Allison Crowe’s own website @ http://music.allisoncrowe.com/album/souling as well as on iTunes @ https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/souling/id933188580 plus CD Baby @ http://cdbaby.com/cd/allisoncrowe10 and all major digital music outlets worldwide.

I own a copy of an old 'Now That's What I Call Music Video' VHS from the 1980s\, which I bought purely for this clip. As far as I am aware\, this is the only 'official' release of the video on VHS or DVD formatt. I have fixed the colour\, made the video a little sharper\, and I used the CD audio of the song to remaster the video's audio which was in mono and very muddy.  This video is a gem\, and as a huge Tina fan\, an excellent find. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I do. COL channel name VAL beyoncesmaw	0

Mento is a Jamaican music style that is largely unknown outside of that is the grandpappy of reggae. For a ska or reggae fan\, mento sounds familiar and exotic and sometimes unfamiliar. Mento recordings are difficult to come by\, but worth seeking out. It's music that lifts my spirits and relaxes my mind whenever I hear it.  During mento's middle period of the 1960s\, Count Owen became prolific\, as he recorded a string of five LPs that moved from mento to ska to rock steady.  "Down Jamaica Way" is the first Count Owen LP. It sticks to traditional rural mento instrumentation\, and for the most part\, repertoire.

COL title VAL Air on a G String COL performer VAL Vanessa-Mae	COL video title VAL Ray Johnson - I Heard It Through The Grapevine (Smokey Robinson & The Miracles Cover) COL description VAL From '' Funky Way '' Label: Inarts Records -- IA 107 Format: Vinyl\, 7"\, 45 RPM Country: US  Tracklist A Funky Way   B I Heard It Through The Grapevine    Producer -- Fred Darian  ------------------------  "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" is a landmark song in the history of Motown Records. Written by Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong in 1966\, the single was first recorded by Smokey Robinson & the Miracles. Released on September 25\, 1967 as Soul 35039 by Gladys Knight & the Pips who recorded the third version of the song\, it has since become a signature song for singer Marvin Gaye\, who recorded his version of the song prior to the Pips' but released it after theirs on October 30\, 1968 as Tamla 54176. Creedence Clearwater Revival released their version of the song in 1970.  Gaye's version has since become a landmark in pop music. In 2004\, it ranked No.80 on Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. On the commemorative 50th Anniversary of the Billboard Hot 100 issue of Billboard magazine in June 2008\, Gaye's version was ranked as the 65th biggest song on the chart.  Early recordings  In 1966\, Barrett Strong\, a former recording artist for Motown Records and the singer behind the label's breakthrough hit\, "Money (That's What I Want)"\, had begun to work in the songwriting staff after failing to produce a follow-up hit. Motown CEO Berry Gordy hired Strong to work with Norman Whitfield to work on recordings for The Temptations following the success of Whitfield's recording of the group's "Ain't Too Proud to Beg". Strong originally composed "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" due to his own personal relationship. Whitfield began collaborating with Strong on the song and eventually decided to record it with The Miracles\, who recorded the song on August 6\, 1966. Due to Gordy's strong veto power during Motown's annual Friday meetings at Hitsville USA's Quality Control Department\, the Miracles' version was deemed unreleasable. Gordy thought the song was "horrible" and advised Whitfield and Strong to create a stronger single\, however the duo refused to budge. Years later\, a second version by The Miracles\, with a similar arrangement to their first version\, appeared as an album track on their 1968 Special Occasion LP. Their original recording was issued years later on a compilation album entitled Motown Sings Motown Treasures.  Other notable covers and references in media  Following Marvin Gaye's 1968 release of the single\, his version has been frequently covered by artists of varied genres. In 1969\, Whitfield produced a version for The Temptations for their hit album\, Cloud Nine though their version recalled The Pips'. In 1971\, The Undisputed Truth became the final Motown act to record the song in its Marvin-styled version. The song was also covered by The Chi-Lites on their 1969 debut album Give It Away.  Creedence Clearwater Revival recorded an eleven-minute version for their album\, Cosmo's Factory\, released in 1970. Other versions have been recorded in other genres such as punk rock where the UK-based The Slits recorded a heavily dub version as a b-side of their first single recording it in the Marvin Gaye version. Other groups such as Tuxedomoon\, The Crust Brothers and the disco band\, P'Zzazz\, featuring Mildred Vancy on vocals\, also recorded the song.  In 1981\, funk musician Roger Troutman\, released a cover of the song in an extended version off his debut solo project\, The Many Facets of Roger. Troutman's version brought the song back to number one on the R&B chart in early 1982 marking the third time the single reached the top spot on that chart. It also made the Billboard Hot 100\, peaking at number seventy-nine. During the 1990s\, the song is heard briefly in the movie Friday.  In 1986\, several studio singers re-recorded the song and featured it in a commercial for the clay-animated singing group The California Raisins. Their version became their signature tune\, mainly due to a pun on the fact that raisins originate from "the grapevine."  Other artists to have recorded the song have included Trini Lopez\, the Soultans and the Flying Pickets\, the Doug Anthony All Stars\, Giorgia\, Marisa Monte\, Kaiser Chiefs\, Michael Chapdelaine\, Paul Weller and Amy Winehouse in a duet version while performing on Jools Holland\, The Robustos\, Tina Turner\, Elton John\, Diana DeGarmo\, Michael McDonald\, Birds of Tokyo\, Craig David and Fairport Convention in a live version with vocals by Richard Thompson.  A humorous cover of the song was recorded by Paul Shanklin for the album\, Bill Clinton: The Early Years\, based on former President Bill Clinton. Antonio Forcione recorded an instrumental version on his live album. Queen Latifah used the song in Gaye's version as a basis for her 1998 single Paper\, produced by Pras Michel for her album Order in the Court.  Marvin Gaye's version has been featured in films including The Big Chill (1983) and Remember the Titans (2001) and was featured in the 2008 play\, The Big Payback. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

Él nació en Glasgow\, Kentucky\, donde su padre era un barbero que amó la música e inspiró a Billy y le enseñó  tocar la mandolina a la edad de 3 años cuando padecía  un caso de la sarampión. Él continuó aprendiendo varios otros instrumentos.  En 1941 Vaughn se afilió a la Guardia Nacional de los Estados Unidos para lo que había sido preparado como una cesión de un año\, pero cuando la Segunda Guerra Mundial estalló\, le enviaron al extranjero hasta el final la guerra  en 1945.  Él decidió hacer de la música su carrera cuando él fue licenciado del ejército al final de guerra\, y asistió al Colegio de Estado de Kentucky Occidental\, ahora conocido como la Universidad de Kentucky Occidental.  Mientras él estaba un estudiante allí\, otros tres compañeros\, Jimmy Sacca\, Donald McGuire\, y Seymour Spiegelman\, que habían formado un trío vocal\, el Hilltoppers\, reclutaron a Vaughn para tocar el piano con ellos. Él pronto añadió su voz \, convirtiendo el trío en un cuarteto. Como  miembro del grupo\, él también escribió su primera canción \, Tentativa\, que charted en 1952.  En 1954 dejó el grupo para afiliarse a Archivos de Punto en Gallatin\, Tennessee como el director de música. Posteriormente formó su propia orquesta\, y tuvo un gran éxito en aquel mismo año "con la Melodía del Amor." Continuó cosechando éxitos  durante la próxima década y media. Vaughn murió del cáncer en Palomar\, California el 26 de septiembre\, { El 26 de septiembre} 1991.

COL title VAL Die 10 001.

"Tenderly" has been recorded by many famous artists\, but possibly the best-known version is by Rosemary Clooney. Her recorded version reached only #17 on the Billboard magazine pop charts in early 1952\, but is more popular than the chart data would suggest\, as is evidenced by the fact that Tenderly served as the theme song for Clooney's 1956-1957 TV variety show. It also became her signature song.  I consciously came to know of the song in the late 1970's while watching a Bing Crosby Special; Rosemary\, a guest star on the show\, sang it and it just took my breath away; I immediately realized that I had heard the song before\, and it brought vivid memories of my childhood and my mother. It is because of this that I made this video - A way to pay tribute to this great artist\, song and to the beautiful memory of my late mother. It is to her that I dedicate this song and I know she watches from a better place. COL channel name VAL boopkid	0

This is just an Excellent cover of Higher Ground--one that I think might just have inspired the Red Hot Chili Peppers--although I'll take Ellen's version.  I'll take it over Stevie's as well.  Ellen was born in the USA\, spend many years in Japan as her parents were missionaries and has now lives in Calgary.   She's been living in Canada for many decades now.

COL title VAL Yellow River COL performer VAL The Compton Brothers	COL video title VAL Mississippi Fred Mcdowell Kokomo Me Baby COL description VAL Fred McDowell (January 12\, 1904 - July 3\, 1972) known by his stage name; Mississippi Fred McDowell\, was a blues singer and guitar player in the North Mississippi style.  McDowell was born in Rossville\, Tennessee\, near Memphis. His parents\, who were farmers\, died when McDowell was a youth. He started playing guitar at the age of 14 and played at dances around Rossville. Wanting a change from plowing fields\, he moved to Memphis in 1926 where he worked in a number of jobs and played music for tips. He settled in Como\, Mississippi\, about 40 miles south of Memphis\, in 1940 or 1941\, and worked steadily as a farmer\, continuing to perform music at dances and picnics. Initially he played slide guitar  using a pocket knife and then a slide made from a beef rib bone\, later switching to a glass slide for its clearer sound. He played with the slide on his ring finger.[4]  While commonly lumped together with Delta Blues singers\, McDowell actually may be considered the first of the bluesmen from the 'North Mississippi' region - parallel to\, but somewhat east of the Delta region - to achieve widespread recognition for his work. A version of the state's signature musical form somewhat closer in structure to its African roots (often eschewing the chord change for the hypnotic effect of the droning\, single chord vamp)\, the North Mississippi style (or at least its aesthetic) may be heard to have been carried on in the music of such figures as Junior Kimbrough and R. L. Burnside\, while serving as the original impetus behind creation of the Fat Possum record label out of Oxford\, Mississippi.[citation needed]  The 1950s brought a rising interest in blues music and folk music in the United States and McDowell was brought to wider public attention\, beginning when he was discovered and recorded in 1959 by Alan Lomax and Shirley Collins.[5] McDowell's records were popular\, and he performed often at festivals and clubs.[6] McDowell continued to perform blues in the North Mississippi blues style much as he had for decades\, but he sometimes performed on electric guitar rather than acoustic guitar. While he famously declared "I do not play no rock and roll\," McDowell was not averse to associating with many younger rock musicians: He coached Bonnie Raitt on slide guitar technique\,[6] and was reportedly flattered by The Rolling Stones' rather straightforward\, authentic version of his "You Gotta Move" on their 1971 Sticky Fingers album.  McDowell's 1969 album I Do Not Play No Rock 'N' Roll was his first featuring electric guitar. It features parts of an interview in which he discusses the origins of the blues and the nature of love. (This interview was sampled and mixed into a song\, also titled "I Do Not Play No Rock 'N' Roll" by Dangerman in 1999.) McDowell's final album[7]\, Live in New York (Oblivion Records)\, was a concert performance from November 1971 at the Village Gaslight (aka The Gaslight Cafe)\, Greenwich Village\, New York.  McDowell died of cancer in 1972\, aged 68\, and was buried at Hammond Hill Baptist Church\, between Como and Senatobia\, Mississippi. On August 6\, 1993 a memorial was placed on his grave site by the Mt. Zion Memorial Fund. The ceremony was presided over by Dick Waterman\, and the memorial with McDowell's portrait upon it was paid for by Bonnie Raitt. The memorial stone was a replacement for an inaccurate and damaged marker (McDowell's name was misspelled) and the original stone was subsequently donated by McDowell's family to the Delta Blues Museum in Clarksdale\, Mississippi.

Noel\, Noel\, Noel\, Noel Born is the King of Israel!  They looked up and saw a star Shining in the East beyond them far And to the earth it gave great light And so it continued both day and night. Noel\, Noel\, Noel\, Noel Born is the King of Israel!  And by the light of that same star Three Wise men came from country far To seek for a King was their intent And to follow the star wherever it went. Noel\, Noel\, Noel\, Noel Born is the King of Israel!  This star drew nigh to the northwest O'er Bethlehem it took it's rest And there it did both Pause and stay Right o'er the place where Jesus lay. Noel\, Noel\, Noel\, Noel Born is the King of Israel!  Then entered in those Wise men three Full reverently upon their knee And offered there in His presence Their gold and myrrh and frankincense. Noel\, Noel\, Noel\, Noel Born is the King of Israel!  Then let us all with one accord Sing praises to our heavenly Lord That hath made Heaven and earth of nought And with his blood mankind has bought.

COL title VAL Scarborough Fair COL performer VAL Peter Hofmann	COL video title VAL Ferrante & Teicher - Scarborough Fair (4/12) COL description VAL Ferrante & Teicher were a duo of American piano players\, known for their light arrangements of familiar classical pieces\, movie soundtracks\, and show tunes.  Scarborough Fair Trad. arr. Ferrante & Teicher  United Artists 6725  Arthur Ferrante (September 7\, 1921\, New York City -- September 19\, 2009)\, and Louis Teicher (August 24\, 1924\, Wilkes-Barre\, Pennsylvania -- August 3\, 2008) met while studying at the Juilliard School of Music in New York. Musical prodigies\, they began performing as a piano duo while still in school. After graduating\, they both joined the Juilliard faculty.  Steven Tyler of Aerosmith relates the story that in the 1950's the two students practiced in the home of his grandmother Constance Neidhart Tallarico.  In 1947\, they launched a full-time concert career\, at first playing nightclubs\, then quickly moving up to playing classical music with orchestral backing. Between 1950 and 1980\, they were a major American easy listening act\, and scored four big U.S. hits: "Theme From The Apartment" (Pop #10)\, "Theme From Exodus" (Pop #2)\, "Tonight" (Pop #8)\, and "Midnight Cowboy" (Pop #10). They performed and recorded regularly with pops orchestras popular standards by George Gershwin\, Jerome Kern\, Cole Porter\, Richard Rodgers and others. In 1973\, they did the Hollywood Radio Theater theme for the Rod Serling radio drama series\, The Zero Hour.  The duo also experimented with prepared pianos\, adding paper\, sticks\, rubber\, wood blocks\, metal bars\, chains\, glass\, mallets\, and other found objects to piano string beds. In this way they were able to produce a variety of bizarre sounds that sometimes resembled percussion instruments\, and at other times resulted in special effects that sounded as if they were electronically synthesized.  Both men were initiated as honorary members of Tau Kappa Epsilon at Central State University (now University of Central Oklahoma) while on tour.  Ferrante and Teicher ceased performing in 1989 and retired to Longboat Key and Siesta Key\, respectively\, both close to each other on the west coast of Florida. They continued to play together occasionally at a local piano store.  CDs of their music\, some of it not previously released\, have continued to appear.  Louis Teicher died in 2008\, three weeks before his 84th birthday. Arthur Ferrante died on September 19\, 2009 at 88 (he had once said he wanted to live one year for each piano key). Arthur is survived by his wife\, Jena; his daughter\, Brenda Eberhardt; and two granddaughters. COL channel name VAL MultiUriahheep	1

TESTO DELLA CANZONE E BIOGRAFIA DELL'INTERPRETE  TESTO: Un bacio ti domando ma tu non dici quando. tu sempre mi rispondi: "chissa'\, chissa'\, chissa'..." ed ogni di' che passa\, cosi' mi fai soffrire\, perche' non fai che dire: "chissa'\, chissa'\, chissa'..." per te io mi tormento pensando\, pensando. aspetto che tu m'ami\, non so quando\, non so quando. ed ogni di' che passa così\, mi fai soffrire\, perche' non fai che dire: "chissa'\, chissa'\, chissa'..."

BIOGRAFIA (da Wikipedia): Entra all'EIAR vincendo il secondo concorso per voci nuove Gara nazionale per gli artisti della canzone\, indetto dall'ente radiofonico nel 1939\, esordendo nel 1940 insieme a Silvana Fioresi nell'orchestra Angelini e proseguendo poi in quelle di Pippo Barzizza\, Carlo Zeme e Beppe Mojetta. Allo stesso periodo risalgono le prime incisioni\, realizzate per la Cetra; nel 1947 incide le canzoni Abbasso le donne e La luna e sei soldi\, tratte dalle colonne sonore dei rispettivi omonimi film. Dotato di una voce baritonale lievemente rauca\, canta anche in orchestre di jazz\, esibendosi spesso con il noto chitarrista Michele Ortuso; il successo continua per tutto il decennio\, finché\, nel 1952 si trasferisce in Sudamerica a seguito di un ingaggio cinematografico; lì continua l'attività sino al periodo a cavallo tra gli anni settanta ed ottanta\, quando\, dopo essersi esibito ancora con successo per lungo tempo nei ritrovi più prestigiosi del Venezuela\, si ritira a Caracas. Nel 2006 il regista Pasquale Pozzessere ha inserito\, nella colonna sonora della miniserie televisiva La provinciale\, la canzone La ragazza del ritmo\, della quale Donà\, oltre che interprete\, è stato anche autore del testo e della musica. Tra i suoi motivi più famosi\, si ricordano: Venezia\, la luna e tu\, Buonanotte Brasil\, Bocca nel buio\, La danza dello scoiattolo\, Il tamburo della banda d'Affori (una delle sue canzoni più note\, scritta da Mario Panzeri)\, Serenata ad un angelo\, Ballerina\, Botta e risposta\, Suona balalaika e Tarantella d'amore.

From the liner notes on their LP we can also tell you Greg Weiss was the lead singer and was responsible for writing roughly half the material. The rest of the line up consisted of bassist Bill\, guitarist Billy\, drummer Joey and keyboard player Sal (great detail there). Produced by Bernie Lawrence\, the majority of 1970's "Toy Factory" found the band trying to fight their way through rather faceless MOR pop. Lead singer Greg Weiss had a decent voice\, but on tracks such as "What Is Youth"\, "To Live or Die" and "Honey\, Forever" he employed an irritating faux-English accent that recalled Davy Jones (he sounds like David Hemmings to me Bad Cat!!!). He also had an irritating habit of throwing mock sobs and groans into the mix ("When I'm with You" and "Honey Forever"). Strike three were the occasional French lyrics (don't pick on the French Bad Cat!!!) he tossed into the mix ("To Live or Die" and "Honey Forever"). Curiously\, the band was at their best when they cut loose and go for a harder rock sound. In this case\, the pseudo-psychedelic "No Rhyme To Orange" (sporting a nice fuzz guitar solo) and "Things" was a nifty slice of blue-eyed soul. "Summertime" also found the band turning in one of the weirdest George Gershwin covers we've ever heard (pretty decent guitar here too Bad Cat!!!). This one certainly won't change your life\, but it's one of those period failures that's worth checking out. (Tyme Machine Blog) COL channel name VAL Melomano Discos	0

COL title VAL Make the World Go Away COL performer VAL Nancy Wilson	COL video title VAL Maggie Bell - Wishing Well COL description VAL Suicide Sal - 1975  The success of Angel Air's series of Maggie Bell reissues can be easily judged by the Scottish singer's return to the U.K. after residing for years abroad\, a planned autobiography\, and her intention of touring. Although critically feted in the U.K.\, Bell\, both solo and with her former band Stone the Crows\, never quite achieved the commercial breakthrough everyone had so expected. Always a bridesmaid\, never a bride\, Bell's recording career was punctuated by a sole Stone the Crows charting album. With that band's demise in 1973\, the soul singer went solo\, releasing the (again) critically acclaimed Queen of the Night album\, with 1975's Suicide Sal following. A tougher\, more energized set than its predecessor\, Sal's electrifying live feel reflects the incendiary stage shows Bell and her new backing band had been playing in the intervening time between recordings. The two bonus tracks\, recorded at a gig later that year\, capture their live ferocity. Intriguingly\, the funky\, fiery title track\, an homage to Bell's Aunt\, a music hall star\, is one of only two originals on this set. The second\, the lavishly bluesy "If You Don't Know" was penned by band keyboardist Pete Wingfield\, and boasts a guesting Jimmy Page on guitar. The storming "Coming on Strong" also has a Bell connection\, being co-penned by ex-Crow Colin Allen and Zoot Money. The rest of the album comprises astutely chosen covers drawn from an eclectic selection of artists. One of the standouts is "It's Been So Long\," a powerful gospel number written by the Pretty Things' Phil May\, who not only rewrote some of the lyrics for Bell\, but added his backing vocals to the song. Free's classic "Wishing Well" gets a sensational workout\, while that band's offshoot Kossoff\, Kirke\, Tetsu & Rabbit's "Hold On" is taken to new emotive heights. From barrelling Beatles pop to the Sutherland Brothers poignant Gaelic ode\, from ballads to hefty rock & roll\, Bell struts across this set with style and such assurance\, that even Aunt Sal must have been impressed. One of Britain's greatest soul singers\, showcased at her best\, this magnificent album also includes an excellent\, expansive biography of this crucial artist.

COL title VAL Let It Be Me COL performer VAL Skeeter Davis & Bobby Bare	COL video title VAL The Sweet Inspirations - Let It Be Me COL description VAL Info: The Sweet Inspirations were an American R&B girl group mostly known for their work as backup singers on studio recordings for other R&B and rock artists. A founding member of the group was Dionne Warwick\, who was later replaced by her aunt\, Cissy Houston. The Sweet Inspirations was founded by former members of The Drinkard Singers\, a long-running Gospel singing group whose membership included Cissy Houston (née Drinkard\, and mother of Whitney Houston\, 1963) and Lee Warwick\, who was Cissy's sister and the mother of Sweet Inspirations members Dee Dee and Dionne Warwick). As a backup group\, the Sweet Inspirations were in high demand among producers\, publishers\, artists\, and songwriters in the early 1960s. The original lineup included Doris Troy and the two Warwick sisters Dionne & Dee Dee. Sylvia Shemwell (sister of Judy Clay) replaced Troy\, while Cissy Houston took over from Dionne\, with Dee Dee Warwick as the group's official leader. The group sang backup for many stars\, including Solomon Burke\, Aretha Franklin\, Wilson Pickett\, and Esther Phillips. Dee Dee left in 1965\, when her solo career began to take off. She was replaced by Myrna Smith. Estelle Brown joined the team soon after\, and the line-up that was to become an Atlantic recording group was set. The Sweet Inspirations recorded by themselves for the first time in April 1967 for Atlantic Records. That session produced the first two singles released by Atlantic\, a version of "Why (Am I Treated So Bad)\," a song previously recorded by The Staple Singers and a soulful version of "Let It Be Me"\, a French song which had been a pop and R&B hit for Betty Everett & Jerry Butler in 1964.

He left before graduating to enroll at the Paris Conservatoire in order to concentrate on a vocal career. He started in the cabarets of Paris at the age of 17\, and was subsequently accompanied on his first album by the pianist/composer Mireille\, whose song Couchés dans le foin became a great success. Later\, he partnered the wildly popular Mistinguett at the Casino de Paris and boosted his career considerably. He was the first cabaret singer to use a microphone in his stage act. In the 1920s he spent time in Brazil where his recordings remain extremely popular today. In 1937\, he won the Grand Prix du Disque for the song "Vous qui passez sans me voir\," written for him by Charles Trenet and Johnny Hess. That same year\, he went to the United States\, where he sang on live radio broadcasts for CBS and made several records in the English language. On Broadway\, he worked with luminaries such as Cole Porter and George Gershwin. He returned to Paris but with the German occupation of France in World War II\, he went back to America for the duration. Sablon became one of the most widely acclaimed male French singers\, considered second only in overall lifetime popularity to Maurice Chevalier. His records sold in the millions around the world and he is frequently referred to as the French equivalent of America's Bing Crosby. During his career\, he recorded with some of the world's top musicians\, including Django Reinhardt and Stéphane Grappelli. Sablon is credited with arranging Reinhardt's debut in a fashionable cabaret in 1933. He is also recognized for his talents as a lyricist and a composer. Sablon appeared in a number of motion pictures and television films performing as a vocalist or pianist\, his last coming in 1984 when he sang "April in Paris" in Mistral's Daughter\, the popular American TV miniseries filmed in France. Jean died in 1994 and was interred in the Cimetière du Montparnasse in Paris.  Jean Sablon est un auteur-compositeur-interprète français. Il est l'un des premiers chanteurs français à s'intéresser au jazz. Créateur de plusieurs œuvres de Mireille et Jean Nohain\, puis de Charles Trenet\, il est le premier à utiliser un microphone sur une scène française en 1936. Vedette du disque et de la radio\, il quitte la France en 1937 pour un contrat à la NBC. Ses shows font de lui une vedette de premier plan aux États-Unis. Chanteur français désormais le plus international de sa génération\, il devient l'ambassadeur de la chanson et se consacre à ses tournées sur les cinq continents\, retrouvant régulièrement les principales salles françaises. Il conclut ses soixante-et-un ans de carrière par d'ultimes adieux en 1984. COL channel name VAL MusicFromParis	0

COL title VAL We'll Be Together Again COL performer VAL Tete Montoliu	COL video title VAL Ella Fitzgerald - Cry Me A River (Verve Records 1961) COL description VAL "Cry Me a River" is a popular American torch song\, written by Arthur Hamilton and first published in 1953\, and made famous in the version by Julie London\, 1955.  A jazzy blues ballad\, "Cry Me a River" was originally written for Ella Fitzgerald to sing in the 1920s-set film\, Pete Kelly's Blues (released 1955) but the song was dropped. It has been said that it was dropped because\, at the time of Ella's recording\, film and record producers said that the audience would not believe that a "colored/black" person would know what the word Plebeian meant nor would they use it. They were afraid that Ella's vocals combined with the use of such an "intelligent" word would upset their target audience.  Fitzgerald first released a recording of the song on Clap Hands\, Here Comes Charlie! in 1961.   The song's first release and most famous recording was by actress/singer Julie London in 1955\, backed by Barney Kessel on guitar and Ray Leatherwood on bass. A sultry performance of the song by London in the 1956 film The Girl Can't Help It helped to make it a million-selling blockbuster (#9 US/#22 UK). London's recording was later featured in the soundtrack's for the movies 'Passion of Mind (2000)\, and V for Vendetta (2005).  Barbra Streisand sang this song on her 1963 debut album as the opening track of Side 1. In 1970\, British blues rocker Joe Cocker made the chart with an upbeat rock rendition on the album\, Mad Dogs and Englishmen. In 1995\, British actress Denise Welch's double A-side "You Don't Have to Say You Love Me" / "Cry Me a River" spent three weeks in the UK Singles Chart\, reaching #23. Canadian jazz pianist and singer Diana Krall recorded the song on her 2001 album\, The Look of Love. In 2009\, Canadian singer Michael Bublé entered the charts with a big-band jazz version\, which is also the opening track of his fourth album Crazy Love. This adaption of the song was used in the BBC's advertising and theme music for coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.  Ella Jane Fitzgerald (April 25\, 1917 – June 15\, 1996) was an American jazz vocalist with a vocal range spanning three octaves (D♭3 to D♭6). Often referred to as the "First Lady of Song\," the "Queen of Jazz" and "Lady Ella\," she was noted for her purity of tone\, impeccable diction\, phrasing and intonation\, and a "horn-like" improvisational ability\, particularly in her scat singing.  Fitzgerald was a notable interpreter of the Great American Songbook. Over the course of her 60-year recording career\, she sold 40 million copies of her 70-plus albums\, won 13 Grammy Awards and was awarded the National Medal of Arts by Ronald Reagan and the Presidential Medal of Freedom by George H. W. Bush.  Ella's accompanied by Lou Levy (piano); Herb Ellis (guitar); Joe Mondragon (bass); and Gus Johnson (drums).  Recorded June 23\, 1961\, Los Angeles (Verve Records)  Now you say you're lonely You cried the long night through Well\, you can cry me a river Cry me a river I cried a river over you Now you say you're sorry For being so untrue Well\, you can cry me a river Cry me a river I cried a river over you You drove me\, Nearly drove me out of my head While you never shed a tear Remember? I remember all that you said Told me love was to plebeian Told me you were through with me Now you say you love me Well\, just to prove you do Cry me a river Cry me a river I cried a river over you You drove me Nearly drove me out of my head While you never shed a tear Remember?

Fair use is a use permitted by copyright statute that might otherwise be infringing. Non-profit\, educational or personal use tips the balance in favour of fair use. count owen and his calypsonians - kalypso records japanese repress - mento Count Owen's middle period mento album\, "Calypsos Down Jamaica Way" was originally published in 1960 on the label "Kalypso"\, a subsidiary of "Melodisc".  Mento is a Jamaican music style that is largely unknown outside of that is the grandpappy of reggae. For a ska or reggae fan\, mento sounds familiar and exotic and sometimes unfamiliar. Mento recordings are difficult to come by\, but worth seeking out. It's music that lifts my spirits and relaxes my mind whenever I hear it.  During mento's middle period of the 1960s\, Count Owen became prolific\, as he recorded a string of five LPs that moved from mento to ska to rock steady.  "Down Jamaica Way" is the first Count Owen LP. It sticks to traditional rural mento instrumentation\, and for the most part\, repertoire.

COL title VAL Pledging My Love COL performer VAL Sonny James\, The Southern Gentleman	COL video title VAL Roy Head - Pledging my love COL description VAL The song\, of course\, is the famous blues ballad which became a posthumous hit for Johnny Ace in 1955 after his self-inflicted accidental gunshot wound. It was written by Ferdinand Washington and Don Robey (of Duke Records)\, not Johnny Ace himself.  At this stage in his career Huey Meaux was trying various musical suits on Roy to see what might catch the public ear. This was the country Roy announced by the pedal steel as soon as the record starts.  This\, and other tracks\, come from the album "Country Crooner" which was issued in 1999 on Edsel as one of their Crazy Cajun series of albums which pulled together recordings produced by Huey P Meaux in Houston in the late '60's and '70's. Meaux used the Crazy Cajun name for one of a series of labels which he operated in the timeframe.  Roy Head had his one and only hit for Huey Meaux in 1965 with "Treat Her Right" which is rightly regarded as a classic of blue-eyed soul.  For a variety of reasons Roy didn't manage to follow this record up successfully. He drifted between labels until he came under control of Meaux again in\, I think\, the mid seventies. Two albums were issued of his music\, "Boogie Down" and "Rock'n'Roll My Soul". Edsel issued two albums in 1999 covering music from those albums\, the aforementioned "Country Crooner" and "White Texas Soul Shouter". I assume Edsel's intention was to cover the more soul and R&B oriented in the latter and the C&W ones in the former. The recordings themselves were apparently spread over a wide period from the late '60's through to the mid '70's.   The musicians present on most of these tracks were:  Dahrull Norris - Drums Ira Wilkes - Bass Peter Schless - Keyboards\, Synthesiser Lee O'Neil - Keyboards\, Synthesiser\, Arrangements Mike Pietzsch - Guitar Uncle Mickey Moody - Guitar\, Arrangements Lynn Groom - Guitar The Merlene Singers - Background vocals COL channel name VAL DangerousDaveRR	1

Refusing to pander to any female stereotype\, O'Day presented herself as a "hip" jazz musician\, wearing a band jacket and skirt as opposed to an evening gown.

COL title VAL Tenderly COL performer VAL Lynn Hope Quintet	COL video title VAL Rosemary Clooney - Tenderly - 1952 COL description VAL "Tenderly" is a Pop standard published in 1946 with music by Walter Lloyd Gross (1909-1967) and lyrics by Jack Lawrence.   "Tenderly" has been recorded by many famous artists\, but possibly the best-known version is by Rosemary Clooney. Her recorded version reached only #17 on the Billboard magazine pop charts in early 1952\, but is more popular than the chart data would suggest\, as is evidenced by the fact that Tenderly served as the theme song for Clooney's 1956-1957 TV variety show. It also became her signature song.  I consciously came to know of the song in the late 1970's while watching a Bing Crosby Special; Rosemary\, a guest star on the show\, sang it and it just took my breath away; I immediately realized that I had heard the song before\, and it brought vivid memories of my childhood and my mother. It is because of this that I made this video - A way to pay tribute to this great artist\, song and to the beautiful memory of my late mother. It is to her that I dedicate this song and I know she watches from a better place. COL channel name VAL boopkid	1

Arf! ‎-- AA-015 Format: Vinyl\, 7"\, Single Country: US Released: 1985  Tracklist A In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida B The Smelly Fishy Theme And Variations  ------------------------  "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" is a song by Iron Butterfly\, released on their 1968 album In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida.  At slightly over 17 minutes\, it occupies the entire second side of the In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida album. The track was recorded on May 27\, 1968\, at Ultrasonic Studios in Hempstead\, Long Island\, New York. The single reached number 30 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.  Overview  The song is considered significant in rock history because\, together with music by Blue Cheer\, Jimi Hendrix and Steppenwolf\, it marks the time period when psychedelic music began to form heavy metal. In 2009\, it was named the 24th greatest hard rock song of all time by VH1.  In popular culture  Television  The Simpsons at the beginning of the episode "Bart Sells His Soul"\, under the guise of a church hymn distributed by Bart\, with the title "In the Garden of Eden" (referencing the popular story about the mondegreen) by "I. Ron Butterfly"\, and sung by the unwitting parishioners. Reverend Lovejoy suddenly points out that this sounds a lot like "rock and/or roll!". After a 17 minute skip\, the organist collapses from fatigue.  In the first episode of Bobby's World\, "The Visit To Aunt Ruth's"\, Martha Generic states that there's no sign of civilization on the way to Aunt Ruth's. Bobby daydreams about the stone age featuring a prehistoric version of Iron Butterfly.  Home Improvement in the episode "Flying Sauces"\, Brad and Randy attempt to convince their younger brother Mark that they were actually aliens\, whose alien parents would arrive to retrieve them from the backyard in the middle of the night. The boys' parents Tim and Jill arrange a counter-prank by blaring the song while using spotlights to give the appearance of a UFO\, before emerging dressed as aliens to chase the terrified duo around the yard.  That 70's Show Fez and Hyde smuggle the record into Fez's house by putting it in a Pat Boone album cover.  Criminal Minds at the beginning of season 1 episode "The Tribe".

The Wonder Years Season 3 episode "Night Out". Playing when Kevin and Winnie Cooper are headed to the "Makeout Room" at their first couple's party.  Futurama Season 6 episode "In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela"\, a spoof on the song's title.  House Season 3 episode "The Jerk". The song is playing while a patient is on a monitored mushroom trip to relieve cluster headaches.  Film  Manhunter climax. Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare briefly. Resident Evil Extinction road trip sequence. Ocean's Twelve replay of staged fight in train. Mike Mendez' Killers opening song.  Music  The song is a part of "Polkas on 45" from 1984\, the first of "Weird Al" Yankovic's numerous polka medleys.  Nas' song "Thief's Theme" featured an interpolation of the famous riff from "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" performed by Incredible Bongo Band. Nas would use the same sample again on the 2006 single "Hip Hop Is Dead".  Frank Zappa spoofed the song with a track called In-A-Gadda-Stravinsky.  On the Rollins Band album Do It\, at roughly 5 minutes and 15 seconds into the song "Move Right In"\, the band breaks into the familiar riff from "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"\, playing it for roughly a minute before returning to the original song.  Blind Guardian - Fly - 03 - In a gadda da vida (Iron Butterfly cover)  In Ricky Martin's song Livin' La Vida Loca\, this song is referenced slightly in the end.  In the Chase song "Get it On: (1971)\, the brass instruments quote the last six notes from "In-A Gadda Da-Vida" to end the song. It was not clear whether Iron Butterfly sued Chase for plagiarizing the song  Books  John Ringo \, author of several military Sc-Fi series regularly uses a playlist to be enjoyed when reading the books. In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida is referenced there and some of his more musical minded protagonists play it.

COL title VAL Against All Odds COL performer VAL The Gino Marinello Orchestra	COL video title VAL Leslie West - Tequila.wmv COL description VAL Leslie West - As Phat As It Gets (1999) He's half the man he used to be in terms of mass\, but when it comes to rock & roll\, just stand back and listen as the master holds court. The man who once recorded an album called The Great Fatsby is back\, slimmed down and kicking as hard as ever on tracks like "Palace of the King" and "Allergic." West comes out jamming\, backed by some pretty familiar names from the lexicon of classic rock\, including Joe Lynn Turner\, Kim Simmonds of Savoy Brown\, Popa Chubby\, and a little band called the Destroyers\, who take time away from their day job playing with a fella named George Thorogood. When West rips into the old blues standard "Stormy Monday\," it's take-no-prisoners electric blues\, and his covers of "Tequila" and Otis Redding's "Respect" are Mountain-ized. (Speaking of "Respect\," it's a little-known fact that West's first group\, the Vagrants\, had a version of that very same song out on a single in 1969 that was meant to be their key to the big time\, but when Atco issued Aretha Franklin's now-legendary version\, the Vagrants' record was blasted into obscurity.) "Raw Nerve" rocks with a real Billy Gibbons influence\, and "The Cell" is an infectious life-in-prison tune that's meant to be played loud. Actually\, the whole album sounds best with the volume knob set at 11. Oh\, and if you're looking for blues\, there's a ripsnorter penned by Leon Russell called "Me and My Guitar." "As Phat as It Gets" mixes the best elements of Frank Zappa\, Black Sabbath\, and Mountain into one smoldering tune about weight loss.  Tracklist  1. Saturation (I'm In Love With You)   (03:23) 2.

There were few at the scene\, but they all did agree That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me.  She walks these hills In a long black veil. She visits my grave When the night winds wail  Nobody knows\, nobody sees. Nobody knows but me.  The Judge said "Son\, what is your alibi? if you were somewhere else\, then you won't have to die." I spoke not a word\, though it meant my life\, For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife.  She walks these hills In a long black veil. She visits my grave When the night winds wail  Nobody knows\, nobody sees. Nobody knows but me.  Now the scaffold is high\, and eternity's near. She stood in the crowd\, and shed not a tear. But sometimes at night\, when the cold wind moans In a long black veil\, she cries o'er my bones  She walks these hills In a long black veil. She visits my grave When the night winds wail  Nobody knows\, nobody sees. Nobody knows but me.  Nobody knows\, nobody sees. Nobody knows but me. COL channel name VAL Jane Doe	1

Mento is a Jamaican music style that is largely unknown outside of that is the grandpappy of reggae. For a ska or reggae fan\, mento sounds familiar and exotic and sometimes unfamiliar. Mento recordings are difficult to come by\, but worth seeking out. It's music that lifts my spirits and relaxes my mind whenever I hear it.  During mento's middle period of the 1960s\, Count Owen became prolific\, as he recorded a string of five LPs that moved from mento to ska to rock steady.  "Down Jamaica Way" is the first Count Owen LP. It sticks to traditional rural mento instrumentation\, and for the most part\, repertoire.

COL title VAL Time in a Bottle COL performer VAL Stephanie Jackson	COL video title VAL Patsy Cline - The Wayward Wind COL description VAL One of the greatest singers in the history of country music\, Patsy Cline also helped blaze a trail for female singers to assert themselves as an integral part of the Nashville-dominated country music industry. She was not alone in this regard; Kitty Wells had become a star several years before Cline's big hits in the early '60s. Brenda Lee\, who shared Cline's producer\, did just as much to create a country-pop crossover during the same era; Skeeter Davis briefly enjoyed similar success. Cline has the most legendary aura of any female country singer\, however\, perhaps due to an early death that cut her off just after she had entered her prime.  Cline began recording in the mid-'50s\, and although she recorded quite a bit of material between 1955 and 1960 (17 singles in all)\, only one of them was a hit. That song\, "Walkin' After Midnight\," was both a classic and a Top 20 pop smash. Those who are accustomed to Cline's famous early-'60s hits are in for a bit of a shock when surveying her '50s sessions (which have been reissued on several Rhino compilations). At times she sang flat-out rockabilly; she also tried some churchy tear-weepers. She couldn't follow up "Walkin' After Midnight\," however\, in part because of an exploitative deal that limited her to songs from one publishing company.  Circumstances were not wholly to blame for Cline's commercial failures. She would have never made it as a rockabilly singer\, lacking the conviction of Wanda Jackson or the spunk of Brenda Lee. In fact\, in comparison with her best work\, she sounds rather stiff and ill-at-ease on most of her early singles. Things took a radical turn for the better on all fronts in 1960\, when her initial contract expired. With the help of producer Owen Bradley (who had worked on her sessions all along)\, Cline began selecting material that was both more suitable and of a higher quality than her previous outings.  "I Fall to Pieces\," cut at the very first session where Cline was at liberty to record what she wanted\, was the turning point in her career. Reaching number one in the country charts and number 12 pop\, it was the first of several country-pop crossovers she was to enjoy over the next couple of years. More important\, it set a prototype for commercial Nashville country at its best. Owen Bradley crafted lush orchestral arrangements\, with weeping strings and backup vocals by the Jordanaires\, that owed more to pop (in the best sense) than country.  The country elements were provided by the cream of Nashville's session musicians\, including guitarist Hank Garland\, pianist Floyd Cramer\, and drummer Buddy Harmon. Cline's voice sounded richer\, more confident\, and more mature\, with ageless wise and vulnerable qualities that have enabled her records to maintain their appeal with subsequent generations. When k.d. lang recorded her 1988 album Shadowland with Owen Bradley\, it was this phase of Cline's career that she was specifically attempting to emulate.  It's arguable that too much has been made of Cline's crossover appeal to the pop market. Brenda Lee\, whose records were graced with similar Bradley productions\, was actually more successful in this area (although her records were likely targeted toward a younger audience). Cline's appeal was undeniably more adult\, but she was always more successful with country listeners. Her final four Top Ten country singles\, in fact\, didn't make the pop Top 40.  Despite a severe auto accident in 1961\, Cline remained hot through 1961 and 1962\, with "Crazy" and "She's Got You" both becoming big country and pop hits. Much of her achingly romantic material was supplied by fresh talent like Hank Cochran\, Harlan Howard\, and Willie Nelson (who penned "Crazy"). Although her commercial momentum had faded slightly\, she was still at the top of her game when she died in a plane crash in March of 1963\, at the age of 30. She was only a big star for a couple of years\, but her influence was and remains huge. While the standards of professionalism on her recordings have been emulated ever since\, they've rarely been complemented by as much palpable\, at times heartbreaking emotion in the performances. For those who could do without some of more elaborate arrangements of her later years\, many of her relatively unadorned appearances on radio broadcasts have been thankfully preserved and issued.   ~ Richie Unterberger\, All Music Guide  PLEASE NOTE: I divided my uploads among multiple channels\, Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

On the critically acclaimed 52nd Street\, Fields convincingly demonstrates an unforgettable tableau of 11 wonderful songs from the jazz\, pop\, blues\, and Brazilian jazz genres in which the listener can delight. Accompanied by an array of jazz stars\, including Jeff Lorber\, this is simply a superb recording due to Fields' flawless vocals\, poetic imagination\, and soulful phrasings on such songs as "Maria\," "And I Love Her" featuring Gerald Albright\, the smooth jazz rendition of "A Night in Tunisia" featuring Chris Botti\, and "Open Your Heart" featuring the Oakland Interfaith Youth Gospel Choir. Victor Fields has marvelously timed his lyrics to compliment the breathtaking manner of saxophonist Albright and trumpeter Botti with his masterful tenor range and tells two exceptionally well-told musical stories that are filled with colorful nuance\, imaginative shadings\, and sensual scattings. Fields and Claudia Villela brilliantly transform Toots Thielemans' "Bluesette" into a Brazilian samba that is both lyrical and buoyant. With 52nd Street\, Victor Fields' sensuous\, sexy\, but sunny vocals have put many jazz vocalists in the shade. Top pick: "Five-Two Blues" featuring John R. Burr. COL channel name VAL dc grooves	0

COPYRIGHTS RESERVED BY COPYRIGHT OWNER.This video is used only for non-profit usage and publishing. Gerard de Vries (Hilversum\, 19 augustus 1933) is een Nederlands zanger en diskjockey.Gerard de Vries is vooral bekend om zijn parlando-muziek\, waarin hij in de jaren zestig van de 20e eeuw enkele grote hits scoorde. Bekende hits van hem zijn Het spel kaarten uit 1965 en Giddy up go uit 1966. Veel van zijn nummers hebben het leven als vrachtwagenchauffeur  als onderwerp. Onder meer Giddy up go en Teddybeer zijn hier voorbeelden van. Vaak zijn deze nummers vertalingen van de populaire Amerikaanse zanger Red Sovine. Opvallend is dat de vertaalde nummers van De Vries niet rijmen\, terwijl die van Sovine dat wel doen. De hits over het leven als vrachtwagenchauffeur zijn in de regel verhalend. De nummers van De Vries hebben vaak een moraliserende ondertoon.Radio Veronica-medewerkers en diskjockeys Ad Bouman\, Hans Mondt\, Tom Collins\, Gerard de Vries en Klaas Vaak namen begin 1970 onder de naam De Binkies de carnavalshit  "Met carnaval" op. Het reikt niet verder dan de Tipparade.Naast zanger was Gerard de Vries diskjockey. Hij presenteerde aanvankelijk bij Radio Veronica onder het pseudoniem  Cowboy Gerard en later bij de TROS onder eigen naam. Gerard de Vries baarde opzien door als eerste diskjockey openlijk voor zijn homoseksualiteit uit te komen. In 1972 praatte hij over Les Cranes Engelse tekst heen op diens single "Desiderata". Het werd de B-kant van de in Nederland uitgebrachte single. Op dit moment is Gerard de Vries actief bij de lokale omroep in Wijdemeren\, Radio Wijdemeren.Na zijn carrière als zanger en diskjockey werd Gerard de Vries ondernemer in de paranormale branche.In 2007 was De Vries kort te zien in het 'datingspektakel' van (de Nederlandse versie van) het televisieprogramma Man bijt hond; hij had gereageerd op een oproep van kandidaat 'Gijs'\, die een man zocht. De Vries bood Gijs een zelfgeschreven boekje aan met de titel De Nederlandse taal. COL channel name VAL top401965	0

COL title VAL I Hear You Knocking COL performer VAL Wynonna	COL video title VAL Cowboy Gerard Zo maar een soldaat COL description VAL NO COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT INTENDED. COPYRIGHTS RESERVED BY COPYRIGHT OWNER.This video is used only for non-profit usage and publishing. Gerard de Vries (Hilversum\, 19 augustus 1933) is een Nederlands zanger en diskjockey.Gerard de Vries is vooral bekend om zijn parlando-muziek\, waarin hij in de jaren zestig van de 20e eeuw enkele grote hits scoorde. Bekende hits van hem zijn Het spel kaarten uit 1965 en Giddy up go uit 1966. Veel van zijn nummers hebben het leven als vrachtwagenchauffeur  als onderwerp. Onder meer Giddy up go en Teddybeer zijn hier voorbeelden van. Vaak zijn deze nummers vertalingen van de populaire Amerikaanse zanger Red Sovine. Opvallend is dat de vertaalde nummers van De Vries niet rijmen\, terwijl die van Sovine dat wel doen. De hits over het leven als vrachtwagenchauffeur zijn in de regel verhalend. De nummers van De Vries hebben vaak een moraliserende ondertoon.Radio Veronica-medewerkers en diskjockeys Ad Bouman\, Hans Mondt\, Tom Collins\, Gerard de Vries en Klaas Vaak namen begin 1970 onder de naam De Binkies de carnavalshit  "Met carnaval" op. Het reikt niet verder dan de Tipparade.Naast zanger was Gerard de Vries diskjockey. Hij presenteerde aanvankelijk bij Radio Veronica onder het pseudoniem  Cowboy Gerard en later bij de TROS onder eigen naam. Gerard de Vries baarde opzien door als eerste diskjockey openlijk voor zijn homoseksualiteit uit te komen. In 1972 praatte hij over Les Cranes Engelse tekst heen op diens single "Desiderata". Het werd de B-kant van de in Nederland uitgebrachte single. Op dit moment is Gerard de Vries actief bij de lokale omroep in Wijdemeren\, Radio Wijdemeren.Na zijn carrière als zanger en diskjockey werd Gerard de Vries ondernemer in de paranormale branche.In 2007 was De Vries kort te zien in het 'datingspektakel' van (de Nederlandse versie van) het televisieprogramma Man bijt hond; hij had gereageerd op een oproep van kandidaat 'Gijs'\, die een man zocht. De Vries bood Gijs een zelfgeschreven boekje aan met de titel De Nederlandse taal. COL channel name VAL top401965	0

It has become a pop standard and an even more popular country song since it helped make Hank Williams famous in the 1940s. Published through Tin Pan Alley in 1922\, the song was first recorded by the popular contralto Elsie Clark. Later that year\, it was recorded by Jack Shea (not the 1932 Olympic medalist speed skater) on Vocalion 14333. This recording contains a verse that no later versions include. Emmett Miller recorded it on Okeh 40465\, September 1\, 1925. He re-recorded it on June 12 1928\, accompanied by his Georgia Crackers (which included Tommy Dorsey\, Jimmy Dorsey\, Eddie Lang\, and Leo McConville). On November 26\, 1926\, blues singer Bertha "Chippie" Hill recorded a different song titled "Lovesick Blues" (Okeh 8453). The song was a minor hit for her. The first country music version of the song was by Rex Griffin (Decca 5570)\, September 25\, 1939. The song's most recognizable version did not come until 1948\, with Williams' hit rendition. Though Williams had scored a few hits prior to "Lovesick Blues\," the song was the first of many number one hits on Country radio for the singer. It also marked one of the songwriter's few cover songs. The song's monumental success led to Williams' tenure at the Grand Ole Opry and remains one of his best remembered songs. In 2004\, it was one of 50 recordings chosen that year by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry. His version of the song appeared in such films as The Last Picture Show (1971) and The Shawshank Redemption (1994). Since Williams' hit rendition of the song\, it has been covered by a wide array of performers. Country performers including Slim Whitman (1957)\, Patsy Cline (1960)\, Glen Campbell (1974)\, Charley Pride (1973)\, and LeAnn Rimes (1999)\, have all recorded their own renditions of the song. Floyd Cramer's rock-and-roll cover crossed over to pop audiences in 1962\, while Frank Ifield took the song to #1 in the United Kingdom in 1963. In the 1970s\, Jerry Lee Lewis\, Little Richard\, Arlo Guthrie\, Don McLean\, Etta James and Linda Ronstadt all covered the song. George Strait took his cover all the way to #24 on the country chart in 1992 with little traditional promotion of the single. Alt-country artist Ryan Adams recorded the song for Timeless\, a Hank Williams tribute album. COL channel name VAL RPMmanToledo Ohio	0

I'll stand here and remember just how good it's been\, and I know I'll never love this way again.  I know I'll never love this way again\, so I keep holdin' on before the good is gone.

Noel\, Noel\, Noel\, Noel Born is the King of Israel!  They looked up and saw a star Shining in the East beyond them far And to the earth it gave great light And so it continued both day and night. Noel\, Noel\, Noel\, Noel Born is the King of Israel!  And by the light of that same star Three Wise men came from country far To seek for a King was their intent And to follow the star wherever it went. Noel\, Noel\, Noel\, Noel Born is the King of Israel!  This star drew nigh to the northwest O'er Bethlehem it took it's rest And there it did both Pause and stay Right o'er the place where Jesus lay. Noel\, Noel\, Noel\, Noel Born is the King of Israel!  Then entered in those Wise men three Full reverently upon their knee And offered there in His presence Their gold and myrrh and frankincense. Noel\, Noel\, Noel\, Noel Born is the King of Israel!  Then let us all with one accord Sing praises to our heavenly Lord That hath made Heaven and earth of nought And with his blood mankind has bought.

The singer has such exquisite sensibilities and respectfully memorialises standards such as this one\, as well as her original compositions and collaborations. The mark of a great singer is the ability to cover a song like 'Moon River'\, one of the most recorded tunes in history\, and still make it her own. Now more than half a century old\, the Henry Mancini classic penned for the Audrey Hepburn movie 'Breakfast at Tiffanys'\, is in truly safe hands with Ms Reader. It is delivered with such intimacy but at the same time\, potency and soul. COL channel name VAL daveinprogress3	0

Mento is a Jamaican music style that is largely unknown outside of that is the grandpappy of reggae. For a ska or reggae fan\, mento sounds familiar and exotic and sometimes unfamiliar. Mento recordings are difficult to come by\, but worth seeking out. It's music that lifts my spirits and relaxes my mind whenever I hear it.

COL title VAL Rezaré COL performer VAL Silvio y Sacramento	COL video title VAL Delaney and Bonnie - "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'" (Genesis LP) COL description VAL by Delaney & Bonnie. From the "Genesis" LP  For an album that is clearly a compilation of older material meant to capitalize on the fame from Delaney & Bonnie's 1971 hits on Atco\, The "Genesis" LP is a true find! There are only three tracks from the duo\, all produced by Leon Russell; the nine other titles are Delaney Bramlett solo\, six produced by Jackie DeShannon\, three others with no producer credited. Despite the slight deception -- that this is a Delaney Bramlett album with three bonus tracks by the hit group -- the disc still works on its own. DeShannon has Delaney sounding like Gene Pitney on "Tomorrow Never Comes\," while "Heartbreak Hotel" and Ray Charles' "I Got a Woman" have him emulating Elvis. On the uncredited production of "Lonely Me\," Mr. Bramlett goes for an early John Lennon vocal style\, then veers off to Gerry and the Pacemakers territory on his originals\, "Without Your Love" and "Better Man Than Me\," quite revealing in that they are so different from the music Jimmy Miller produced for the group when Delaney & Bonnie on Tour With Eric Clapton emerged. Jackie DeShannon's pop production kicks in again with "Liverpool Lou\," and it is back to that Gene Pitney sound. COL channel name VAL BobSeger1981	0

Arf! ‎-- AA-015 Format: Vinyl\, 7"\, Single Country: US Released: 1985  Tracklist A In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida B The Smelly Fishy Theme And Variations  ------------------------  "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" is a song by Iron Butterfly\, released on their 1968 album In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida.  At slightly over 17 minutes\, it occupies the entire second side of the In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida album. The track was recorded on May 27\, 1968\, at Ultrasonic Studios in Hempstead\, Long Island\, New York. The single reached number 30 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.  Overview  The song is considered significant in rock history because\, together with music by Blue Cheer\, Jimi Hendrix and Steppenwolf\, it marks the time period when psychedelic music began to form heavy metal. In 2009\, it was named the 24th greatest hard rock song of all time by VH1.  In popular culture  Television  The Simpsons at the beginning of the episode "Bart Sells His Soul"\, under the guise of a church hymn distributed by Bart\, with the title "In the Garden of Eden" (referencing the popular story about the mondegreen) by "I. Ron Butterfly"\, and sung by the unwitting parishioners. Reverend Lovejoy suddenly points out that this sounds a lot like "rock and/or roll!". After a 17 minute skip\, the organist collapses from fatigue.  In the first episode of Bobby's World\, "The Visit To Aunt Ruth's"\, Martha Generic states that there's no sign of civilization on the way to Aunt Ruth's. Bobby daydreams about the stone age featuring a prehistoric version of Iron Butterfly.  Home Improvement in the episode "Flying Sauces"\, Brad and Randy attempt to convince their younger brother Mark that they were actually aliens\, whose alien parents would arrive to retrieve them from the backyard in the middle of the night. The boys' parents Tim and Jill arrange a counter-prank by blaring the song while using spotlights to give the appearance of a UFO\, before emerging dressed as aliens to chase the terrified duo around the yard.  That 70's Show Fez and Hyde smuggle the record into Fez's house by putting it in a Pat Boone album cover.  Criminal Minds at the beginning of season 1 episode "The Tribe".  Rescue Me on bagpipes during a funeral in the series finale.  Supernatural in the opening scene of season 1 episode "Skin".  The A Team episode "Beneath the Surface" background music during a party scene.  Beavis and Butt-head\, season 4\, episode 32: the title is referred to on TV.  The Wonder Years Season 3 episode "Night Out". Playing when Kevin and Winnie Cooper are headed to the "Makeout Room" at their first couple's party.  Futurama Season 6 episode "In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela"\, a spoof on the song's title.  House Season 3 episode "The Jerk". The song is playing while a patient is on a monitored mushroom trip to relieve cluster headaches.  Film  Manhunter climax. Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare briefly. Resident Evil Extinction road trip sequence. Ocean's Twelve replay of staged fight in train. Mike Mendez' Killers opening song.  Music  The song is a part of "Polkas on 45" from 1984\, the first of "Weird Al" Yankovic's numerous polka medleys.  Nas' song "Thief's Theme" featured an interpolation of the famous riff from "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" performed by Incredible Bongo Band. Nas would use the same sample again on the 2006 single "Hip Hop Is Dead".  Frank Zappa spoofed the song with a track called In-A-Gadda-Stravinsky.  On the Rollins Band album Do It\, at roughly 5 minutes and 15 seconds into the song "Move Right In"\, the band breaks into the familiar riff from "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"\, playing it for roughly a minute before returning to the original song.  Blind Guardian - Fly - 03 - In a gadda da vida (Iron Butterfly cover)  In Ricky Martin's song Livin' La Vida Loca\, this song is referenced slightly in the end.  In the Chase song "Get it On: (1971)\, the brass instruments quote the last six notes from "In-A Gadda Da-Vida" to end the song. It was not clear whether Iron Butterfly sued Chase for plagiarizing the song  Books  John Ringo \, author of several military Sc-Fi series regularly uses a playlist to be enjoyed when reading the books. In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida is referenced there and some of his more musical minded protagonists play it.

COL title VAL La paloma COL performer VAL Kurt Maier	COL video title VAL BESAME MUCHO - THE HI-LO'S COL description VAL BESAME MUCHO (Consuelo Velazquez) Vai dizer que nunca ouviu? Este famosíssimo bolero foi escrito em 1940 pela compositora Consolo Velázquez com 24 anos e como ela mesma confessou\, quando ainda não tinha sido beijada. É uma das canções mais populares do século XX e em 1999 foi reconhecida como a mais cantada\, reproduzida e gravada em espanhol. Também é considerada a mais traduzida\, com versões em mais de 20 idiomas THE HI-LO'S The Hi-Lo's were an a cappella quartet formed in 1953. The group's name is reportedly a reference to their extreme vocal and physical ranges (Bob Strasen and Bob Morse were tall\, Gene Puerling and Clark Burroughs were short). Besame Mucho Sunny Skylar - Consuelo Velazquez - Recorded August 7\, 1961 - Arranged by Gene Puerling Consuelo Velásquez Torres (Ciudad Guzmán/Zapotlán el Grande\, Jalisco\, 21 de agosto de 1924 -- Cidade do México\, 22 de janeirode 2005) foi uma pianista e compositora mexicana. Bésame mucho (em português Beija-me muito) é o título de uma canção escrita em 1940 pela mexicana Consuelo Velásquez antes de completar seu 16° aniversário. Segundo Consuelo Velázquez\, ela inspirou-se em uma ária de uma ópera de Enrique Granados. Rapidamente a canção se converteu em uma das mais populares do século XX. Emilio Tuero foi o primeiro a gravar-la. Em 1999\, a canção foi reconhecida com a mais cantada e gravada do idioma espanhol\, e talvez seja a mais traduzida entre as compostas nesta língua. (Wikipedia) Há mais de 2000 gravações diferentes. Cantores brasileiros que gravaram: Francisco Alves\, Clara Nunes\, Leila Pinheiro\, Rosa Passos\, Maysa Matarazzo\, Alda Rezende\, Cauby Peixoto\, Ney Matogrosso.. A gravação mais recente é do conjunto MPB 4\, Muitos cantores de jazz já gravaram como Diana Krall. Temos ainda gravações de The Beatles\, Elvis Presley\, Frank Sinatra\, entre centenas de intérpretes de jazz\, cantores ou instrumentistas de renome.

Él nació en Glasgow\, Kentucky\, donde su padre era un barbero que amó la música e inspiró a Billy y le enseñó  tocar la mandolina a la edad de 3 años cuando padecía  un caso de la sarampión. Él continuó aprendiendo varios otros instrumentos.  En 1941 Vaughn se afilió a la Guardia Nacional de los Estados Unidos para lo que había sido preparado como una cesión de un año\, pero cuando la Segunda Guerra Mundial estalló\, le enviaron al extranjero hasta el final la guerra  en 1945.  Él decidió hacer de la música su carrera cuando él fue licenciado del ejército al final de guerra\, y asistió al Colegio de Estado de Kentucky Occidental\, ahora conocido como la Universidad de Kentucky Occidental.  Mientras él estaba un estudiante allí\, otros tres compañeros\, Jimmy Sacca\, Donald McGuire\, y Seymour Spiegelman\, que habían formado un trío vocal\, el Hilltoppers\, reclutaron a Vaughn para tocar el piano con ellos. Él pronto añadió su voz \, convirtiendo el trío en un cuarteto. Como  miembro del grupo\, él también escribió su primera canción \, Tentativa\, que charted en 1952.  En 1954 dejó el grupo para afiliarse a Archivos de Punto en Gallatin\, Tennessee como el director de música. Posteriormente formó su propia orquesta\, y tuvo un gran éxito en aquel mismo año "con la Melodía del Amor." Continuó cosechando éxitos  durante la próxima década y media. Vaughn murió del cáncer en Palomar\, California el 26 de septiembre\, { El 26 de septiembre} 1991.

COL title VAL For Your Love COL performer VAL Wendy Wu	COL video title VAL Bing Crosby - Brother Can You Spare A Dime? 1932 COL description VAL This was a #1 Hit. Harry Lillis "Bing" Crosby (May 3\, 1903 -- October 14\, 1977) was an American singer and actor. "Brother\, Can You Spare a Dime?"\, also sung as "Buddy\, Can You Spare a Dime?"\, is one of the best-known American songs of the Great Depression. Written in 1931 by lyricist E. Y. "Yip" Harburg and composer Jay Gorney\, "Brother\, Can You Spare a Dime?" was part of the 1932 musical New Americana; the melody is based on a Russian lullaby Gorney heard as a child. It became best known\, however\, through recordings by Bing Crosby and Rudy Vallee. Both versions were released right before Franklin Delano Roosevelt's election to the presidency and both became number one hits on the charts. The Brunswick Crosby recording became the best-selling record of its period\, and came to be viewed as an anthem of the shattered dreams of the era. The song asks why the men who built the nation -- built the railroads\, built the skyscrapers -- who fought in the war (World War I)\, who tilled the earth\, who did what their nation asked of them should\, now that the work is done and their labor no longer necessary\, find themselves abandoned\, in bread lines. It refers to "Yankee Doodle Dum"\, a reference to patriotism\, and the evocation of veterans also recalls military bonuses\, which were a topical issue. The song has unusual structure for a Broadway song. Firstly\, rather than starting in a major key\, as most Broadway songs do\, it begins in a minor key\, which is darker\, and more appropriate for the Depression. When discussing the prosperous past and building the railroads\, the song jumps an octave and moves briefly into a major key\, evoking energy and optimism. It then reverts to a minor key in the word "time" in the line "Once I built a railroad\, made it run / Made it race against time\," marking the end of prosperous times\, and changing to a wistful mood. The song then ends\, not on a note of resignation\, but with anger -- repeating the beginning (as is usual for Broadway songs)\, an octave higher\, but with a significant change: the friendly "Brother\, can you spare a dime?" is replaced with the aggressive "Buddy\, can you spare a dime?"

COL title VAL Cry Me a River COL performer VAL Márta Téli	COL video title VAL Ella Fitzgerald - Cry Me A River (Verve Records 1961) COL description VAL "Cry Me a River" is a popular American torch song\, written by Arthur Hamilton and first published in 1953\, and made famous in the version by Julie London\, 1955.  A jazzy blues ballad\, "Cry Me a River" was originally written for Ella Fitzgerald to sing in the 1920s-set film\, Pete Kelly's Blues (released 1955) but the song was dropped. It has been said that it was dropped because\, at the time of Ella's recording\, film and record producers said that the audience would not believe that a "colored/black" person would know what the word Plebeian meant nor would they use it. They were afraid that Ella's vocals combined with the use of such an "intelligent" word would upset their target audience.  Fitzgerald first released a recording of the song on Clap Hands\, Here Comes Charlie! in 1961.   The song's first release and most famous recording was by actress/singer Julie London in 1955\, backed by Barney Kessel on guitar and Ray Leatherwood on bass. A sultry performance of the song by London in the 1956 film The Girl Can't Help It helped to make it a million-selling blockbuster (#9 US/#22 UK). London's recording was later featured in the soundtrack's for the movies 'Passion of Mind (2000)\, and V for Vendetta (2005).  Barbra Streisand sang this song on her 1963 debut album as the opening track of Side 1. In 1970\, British blues rocker Joe Cocker made the chart with an upbeat rock rendition on the album\, Mad Dogs and Englishmen. In 1995\, British actress Denise Welch's double A-side "You Don't Have to Say You Love Me" / "Cry Me a River" spent three weeks in the UK Singles Chart\, reaching #23. Canadian jazz pianist and singer Diana Krall recorded the song on her 2001 album\, The Look of Love. In 2009\, Canadian singer Michael Bublé entered the charts with a big-band jazz version\, which is also the opening track of his fourth album Crazy Love. This adaption of the song was used in the BBC's advertising and theme music for coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.  Ella Jane Fitzgerald (April 25\, 1917 – June 15\, 1996) was an American jazz vocalist with a vocal range spanning three octaves (D♭3 to D♭6). Often referred to as the "First Lady of Song\," the "Queen of Jazz" and "Lady Ella\," she was noted for her purity of tone\, impeccable diction\, phrasing and intonation\, and a "horn-like" improvisational ability\, particularly in her scat singing.  Fitzgerald was a notable interpreter of the Great American Songbook. Over the course of her 60-year recording career\, she sold 40 million copies of her 70-plus albums\, won 13 Grammy Awards and was awarded the National Medal of Arts by Ronald Reagan and the Presidential Medal of Freedom by George H. W. Bush.  Ella's accompanied by Lou Levy (piano); Herb Ellis (guitar); Joe Mondragon (bass); and Gus Johnson (drums).  Recorded June 23\, 1961\, Los Angeles (Verve Records)  Now you say you're lonely You cried the long night through Well\, you can cry me a river Cry me a river I cried a river over you Now you say you're sorry For being so untrue Well\, you can cry me a river Cry me a river I cried a river over you You drove me\, Nearly drove me out of my head While you never shed a tear Remember?

COL title VAL Tenderly COL performer VAL John Gary	COL video title VAL Rosemary Clooney - Tenderly - 1952 COL description VAL "Tenderly" is a Pop standard published in 1946 with music by Walter Lloyd Gross (1909-1967) and lyrics by Jack Lawrence.   "Tenderly" has been recorded by many famous artists\, but possibly the best-known version is by Rosemary Clooney. Her recorded version reached only #17 on the Billboard magazine pop charts in early 1952\, but is more popular than the chart data would suggest\, as is evidenced by the fact that Tenderly served as the theme song for Clooney's 1956-1957 TV variety show. It also became her signature song.  I consciously came to know of the song in the late 1970's while watching a Bing Crosby Special; Rosemary\, a guest star on the show\, sang it and it just took my breath away; I immediately realized that I had heard the song before\, and it brought vivid memories of my childhood and my mother. It is because of this that I made this video - A way to pay tribute to this great artist\, song and to the beautiful memory of my late mother. It is to her that I dedicate this song and I know she watches from a better place. COL channel name VAL boopkid	1

No copyright infringement intended!  Ten years ago\, on a cold dark night\, Someone was killed 'neath the town hall light. There were few at the scene\, but they all did agree That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me.  She walks these hills In a long black veil. She visits my grave When the night winds wail  Nobody knows\, nobody sees. Nobody knows but me.  The Judge said "Son\, what is your alibi? if you were somewhere else\, then you won't have to die." I spoke not a word\, though it meant my life\, For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife.  She walks these hills In a long black veil. She visits my grave When the night winds wail  Nobody knows\, nobody sees. Nobody knows but me.  Now the scaffold is high\, and eternity's near. She stood in the crowd\, and shed not a tear. But sometimes at night\, when the cold wind moans In a long black veil\, she cries o'er my bones  She walks these hills In a long black veil. She visits my grave When the night winds wail  Nobody knows\, nobody sees. Nobody knows but me.  Nobody knows\, nobody sees. Nobody knows but me. COL channel name VAL Jane Doe	0

COL title VAL Don't Be Cruel COL performer VAL Elvis Presley	COL video title VAL Talk To Me Talk To Me-Jean DuShon-'1961-Atco 6198.wmv COL description VAL Jean DuShon was born in Detroit\, Michigan. As a young girl\, she sang in church and dreamed of the day that she'd become a professional singer. After winning many talent shows\, she suddenly found herself singing in local nightclubs and was described as "the girl who sounds like Dinah Washington." Miss Washington\, herself\, heard about the singer\, who was already headling at the Baby Grand\, and decided to confront the youngster.  DuShon was so frightened after the Washington encounter\, that she immediately found her own style\, which was distinctive and true to her own personality.  As her reputation grew\, John Levy\, the famed agent who managed the likes of Nancy Wilson\, Dakota Staton\, George Shearing\, Cannonball Adderly and many others\, added Jean to his roster of stars. She was booked into swank clubs around the country and was suddenly being mentioned along side the other great female jazz singers like Ella Fitzgerald and Carmen McRae.  After Levy left Chicago for California\, with Wilson in tow\, DuShon's husband became her manager. Jean sang as star vocalist with Cootie Williams Band\, had a short stint with Lloyd Price's group and was asked to join the legendary Fats Domino\, who took her to Las Vegas where they shared the bill at the famed Flamingo Hotel.  While appearing at the Roundtable in New York\, Jean was spotted by Ahmet Ertegun of Atlantic Records. He was so impressed with DuShon that he took her to his company and paired her with the young Phil Spector. Spector guided DuShon through several recordings including a rehash of Little Willie John's "Talk To Me."  DuShon recorded for several labels including Okeh (Columbia)\, Lenox\, ABC Paramount and finally settled at Chess Records out of Chicago\, where she recorded three albums: "Make Way For Jean DuShon\," "You Better Believe Me" (with Ramsey Lewis Trio) and "Feeling Good\," which was arranged and conducted by the legendary\, Oliver Nelson. It is not well-known\, but Jean DuShon was the very first singer to record the classic\, "For Once in My Life."  Miss DuShon found herself on the New York stage (off-Broadway) in several plays and then headed to Broadway and starred in "What The Wine Selles Buy" with Dick Anthony Williams and Glynn Turman\, "Bubbling Brown Sugar" with Cab Calloway and "Blues in the Night" with Leslie Uggams. DuShon received glowing reviews for her performances and in "Blues\," brought down the house singing Bessie Smith's tragic "Wasted Life Blues." Later\, she took over for Odetta in the Chicago musical\, "Little Dreamer - A Night in the Life of Bessie Smith\," which ran for over a year. While in Chicago\, she starred in the PBS musical production called "Precious Memories - Strolling Down 47th Street."  Jean found time to record with Brother Jack McDuff in the 1970s ("The Fourth Dimension\," "Moon Rappin'"). Presently\, Miss DuShon is preparing a one-woman show\, which she plans to take on the road and hopefully\, present the show on Broadway. Also\, she is ready to record again! Jean lives in NYC.

Gates Of Steel - Supernova 12. Freedom Of Choice - Lagwagon 13. Beautiful World - One Hit Wonder  ------------------------  "Whip It" is the title of a 1980 single by the American New Wave band Devo. It appears on the album Freedom of Choice. There were two 7" single releases of "Whip It"\, one backed with a remix of the track "Snowball" (which appears on Freedom of Choice) and one backed with "Turn Around" (a song later covered by Nirvana).  "Whip It" was Devo's biggest hit\, and peaked at number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart\, number three on the Canadian Singles Chart and number 77 on the Australian Singles Chart (Kent Music Report).  It is ranked #62 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of the '80s as well as #15 on the same channel's 100 Greatest One Hit Wonders of the '80s  Song information  "Whip It" is built on a motorik beat\, similar to tracks by Neu!. The lead instrument is a Minimoog synthesizer. The bass is performed with a custom six oscillator synthesizer\, custom made by Moog Music for Devo. The whip sound was made with an EML ElectroComp 500 synthesizer.  On an episode of the VH1 show TrueSpin\, Gerald V. Casale revealed that the lead guitar riff from "Whip It" is based on the riff from "Oh\, Pretty Woman" by Roy Orbison with the beat moved to the back.  Gerald Casale told Songfacts that the lyrics were written by him "as an imitation of Thomas Pynchon's parodies in his book Gravity's Rainbow." The lyrics evoke a working class desire to pull oneself up and to overcome adversity. The song has violent undertones\, and Devo has often described it as about Jimmy Carter\, as Mothersbaugh describes in an interview on To The Best of our Knowledge. However\, many people took the lyrics at face value\, interpreting the song as a paean to masturbation and sadomasochism\, or a reference to inhaling nitrous oxide from whipped cream cans (taken from the name "whip-it"\, used to describe the nitrous chargers for whipped cream dispensers).  "Whip It" debuted at a live concert on December 29th\, 1979 in Santa Cruz\, California. The first performance included a synthesizer solo taken from the early Devo song "Chango." This performance was recorded and is available as a bootleg. A demo version was recorded in 1980 and later released in 2000 on the compilation Recombo DNA released by Rhino Handmade.  Music video  Devo funded the music video for "Whip It" with $15\,000 USD of their own money. The main visual of the video\, Mark Mothersbaugh whipping the clothes off a woman\, was inspired by an article in a 1962 issue of "Dude" magazine. In an interview for Songfacts\, Casale explains "There was a feature article on a guy who had been an actor and fell on hard times\, he wasn't getting parts anymore. He moved with his wife to Arizona\, opened a dude ranch and charged people money to come hang out at the ranch. Every day at noon in the corral\, for entertainment\, he'd whip his wife's clothes off with a 12-foot bullwhip. She sewed the costumes and put them together with Velcro. The story was in the magazine about how good he was and how he never hurt her. We had such a big laugh about it\, we said\, 'OK\, that's the basis for the video. We'll have these cowboys drinking beer and cheering Mark on as he's in the barnyard whipping this pioneer woman's clothes off while the band plays in the corral.'"  In the video\, Devo wears black\, sleeveless turtlenecks\, and their famous Energy Dome headgear. When the video begins\, all the members\, except for Mark Mothersbaugh\, wear the turtlenecks pulled over their faces. During the performance\, each member lowers the turtleneck. Robert Mothersbaugh ("Bob 1") plays a Moog Liberation keytar\, Robert Casale ("Bob 2") plays a red Rheem Kee Bass\, and Alan Myers plays a set of Synare electronic drum pads.  Not surprisingly\, the S&M overtones of the video caused controversy. Devo was forced to abandon a television appearance after the host deemed the video offensive to women. Despite this\, "Whip It" received heavy rotation on MTV after its introduction in 1981. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

COL title VAL My Guy COL performer VAL Mary Wells	COL video title VAL Lillian Roth -- If I Could Be With You (One Hour Tonight) COL description VAL Lillian Roth (13 de diciembre de 1910 — 12 de mayo de 1980) fue una actriz y cantante estadounidense.  Nacida en Boston\, Massachusetts\, tenía únicamente seis años de edad cuando su madre la llevó a Educational Pictures\, donde pasó a ser la imagen de la compañía\, simbolizada por una estatua viviente sosteniendo la lámpara del conocimiento. Al año siguiente debutó como actriz teatral en el circuito de Broadway actuando en The Inner Man. Su primera actuación cinematográfica llegó en 1918 con Pershing's Crusaders. Junto a su hermana Ann actuaban de manera itinerante bajo el nombre de "Lillian Roth and Co\," y a veces las dos eran llamadas "The Roth Kids". Uno de los momentos más emocionantes de ambas hermanas llegó cuando conocieron al Presidente de los Estados Unidos Woodrow Wilson\, cuando éste llevó a las dos a dar la vuelta a la manzana en su coche tras asistir al número de vodevil de ambas. Roth entró en la Clark School of Concentration en los inicios de la década de 1920\, actuó en Artists and Models en 1923 y trabajó en Revels con Frank Fay.  En 1927\, cuando Roth tenía 17 años de edad\, trabajó en la primera de tres Earl Carroll Vanities\, a las cuales pronto siguieron las Midnight Frolics\, una producción de Florenz Ziegfeld. Pronto la joven actriz firmó un contrato de siete años con Paramount Pictures. Entre los filmes que rodó para Paramount figuran El desfile del amor (1929\, con Maurice Chevalier)\, The Vagabond King (1930)\, Paramount on Parade (1930)\, Honey (1930\, en el cual cantaba "Sing\, You Sinners")\, Madam Satan (1930\, de Cecil B. DeMille\, con Reginald Denny y Kay Johnson\, Sea Legs (con Jack Oakie)\, y la segunda película de los Hermanos Marx\, El conflicto de los Marx (1930). Roth hizo para el cine el papel que Ethel Merman había interpretado en la obra teatral Take a Chance\, y cantó "Eadie Was a Lady". Tras dejar Paramount hizo un papel de reparto en el film carcelario femenino Ladies They Talk About (Warner Brothers\, 1933)\, junto a Barbara Stanwyck.  Además\, fue cabeza de cartel del Teatro Palace de Nueva York\, actuando en Earl Carroll Vanities en 1928\, 1931 y 1932\, haciendo grandes progresos en su faceta de cantante. Desafortunadamente\, la vida personal de Roth cada vez se veía más ensombrecida por su adicción al alcohol. Roth estuvo fuera del candelero desde finales de la década de 1930 hasta 1953\, cuando actuó en un episodio especial de la serie televisiva This Is Your Life\, con Ralph Edwards. En respuesta a su sinceridad al relatar su historia de alcoholismo\, Roth recibió más de cuarenta mil cartas. En 1962 encarnó a la madre de Elliott Gould en el musical I Can Get It for You Wholesale\, producción en la cual hacía su debut en Broadway Barbra Streisand. A pesar de la gran acogida conseguida por Streisand\, el productor David Merrick observó que el nombre de Roth todavía vendía entradas\, por lo que tras el estreno puso su nombre por encima del de Gould\, Streisand y Sheree North. Roth permaneció en el show durante todas las representaciones\, un total de 301\, y grabó un disco relativo a la obra para Columbia Records.  Roth se casó al menos cinco veces. Sus maridos fueron el aviador William C. Scott ("Willie Richards")\, el juez Benjamin Shalleck\, Eugene J. Weiner ("Mark Harris")\, Edward Goldman ("Vic")\, y Burt McGuire. Antes de su primera boda había tenido una relación con David Lyons\, fallecido de tuberculosis. En mayo de 1932 se divorció de W. C. Scott\, tras trece meses de matrimonio. En 1955 conoció a Thomas Burt McGuire\, ligado a la editora Funk and Wagnalls Publishing Company\, en una reunión de Alcohólicos Anónimos\, grupo en el cual Roth formaba parte desde 1946. .  Roth falleció a causa de un ictus en 1980 en Nueva York. Tenía 69 años de edad. Fue enterrada en el Cementerio Mount Pleasant del Condado de Westchester\, Nueva York.
