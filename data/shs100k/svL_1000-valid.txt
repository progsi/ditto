Some day you'll return to  Your valleys and your farms  And you'll no longer burn  To be brothers in arms.    Through these fields of destruction  Baptism of fire  I've witnessed your suffering  As the battle raged higher.  And though they did hurt me so bad  In my fear and alarm  You did not desert me  My brothers in arms.    There's so many different worlds  So many different suns  And we have just one world  But we live in different ones.    Now the sun's gone to hell  And the moon's riding high  Let me bid you farewell  Every man has to die.  But it's written in the starlight  And every line in your palm  We're fools to make war  On our brothers in arms... COL channel name VAL UFCHeadhunter	0

Further Country chart remakes: Rex Allen Jr. at #18 in 1976 and #45 for Marty Robbins in 1981. Original Billboard review: "This one could put the thrush back in the best seller class. "Teardrops in my Heart" is an effectively simple Vaughn Horton weeper".  B-side is "Lula Rock-a-Hula"\, which I've also posted. COL channel name VAL TheLimePopsicle	0

COL title VAL Pompeii COL performer VAL Jasmine Thompson	COL video title VAL Jessica Williams - Green Chimneys (T.Monk) COL description VAL Review from allmusic:  «Recorded at a special afternoon series sponsored by Chemekata College in Oregon\, Jazz in the Afternoon is a trio date\, with Williams joined by Dave Captein on bass and Mel Brown on drums. The recording is surprisingly dense however\, with Williams spraying notes all over on her solo for the Monk tune "Green Chimneys" which opens the set. Captein and Brown both sound enthused by the sprightly playing and keep up the pace admirably. Williams changes directions often\, moving with a smooth grace from the stately "Light Blue" (another Monk piece) to a barreling "Straight\, No Chaser" (ditto\, obviously) to Gershwin's playful "Swanee." Her playing never falters throughout the 70-minute recording. Though Williams recorded several excellent live albums\, Jazz in the Afternoon is another great addition to her discography. » COL channel name VAL André Rodrigues Pereira da Silva	0

COL title VAL Skulls COL performer VAL Nutley Brass	COL video title VAL Ronnie Aldrich and His Orchestra - What is life COL description VAL Ronnie Aldrich and His Orchestra (in this case\, the "London Festival Orchestra") bring you this fantastic arrangement of George Harrison's second successful single "What is life ?"  Harrison wrote the song in 1969 for Billy Preston\, but decided to include the composition in his own solo album "All things must pass".  The track became a Top 10 hit in many European countries\, and even in the US.  Ronnie Aldrich (who started playing the piano at age 3 ! ) started his musical career in the 1940's when he formed the band "Ronnie Aldrich and the Squadronaires" (with the word "squadron" appearing in the band's name looks like WWII played an important part here...).  The Squadronaires kept performing until 1964 and then Aldrich signed a contract with Decca. Here he issued more than 30 albums during the late 1960's (and up to his death in 1977) as "Ronnie Aldrich and the two pianos".  These two pianos (alternately to be heard on the left and right channel) conquered a large part of the easy listening audience and hence Aldrich became increasingly popular.  Being a talented composer\, arranger\, conductor and pianist\,  he also often appeared on BBC Radio.  Later\, he became musical director of Thames Television (and was appointed music supervisor for the famous "Benny Hill Show"). From the 1971 album "Love story" here is Ronnie Aldrich with a fabulously arranged version of George Harrison's "What is life".  Enjoy ! COL channel name VAL Socratess2007	0

COL title VAL Let's Burn Down the Cornfield COL performer VAL Sam Samudio	COL video title VAL Doug Sahm - Buzz buzz buzz COL description VAL "Buzz buzz buzz" - many a great single was little more than a few nonsense words cobbled together. This single from the Hollywood Flames in '57 is a great example. And Doug and the boys give it a suitably rip-snorting treatment.  Doug Sahm was an artist who displayed a remarkable capacity for soaking up a wide variety of genres of popular music and demonstrating expertise in such genres\, often within one album.  Outside of a core set of enthusiastic admirers it is just this ability not to be typecast that may well have hampered his acceptance within the wider public domain. Relatively late in his career he recorded a small number of albums which concentrated on one genre or era of music. "Juke Box Music" is one of those albums. It focuses on music that was popular in the Southern US in the fifties. Much of this comes under the broad headings of R&B or doo-wop. The concept of the album is of a jukebox in that timeframe stacked to the gills with great music to dance or smooch to. Doug assembled an ace big band to interpret this music containing many musicians who'd been part of his various ventures in the past.  The main musicians appearing on the album are:  Doug Sahm - Vocals\, Piano & Guitar Rocky Morales - Tenor Sax Charlie McBurney - Trumpet Jack Barber - Bass George Rains - Drums  Addition musicians include:  Wayne Bennett - Guitar Derek O'Brien - Rhythm Guitar Mel Brown - Keyboards Reese Wynans - Keyboards Randy Garibay - Vocal duet Angela Strehli - Background vocals  Produced by George Rains Arrangements by Doug Sahm COL channel name VAL DangerousDaveRR	0

COL title VAL Some Guys Have All the Luck COL performer VAL Matt Forbes	COL video title VAL Bette Bright - Some Girls Have All The Luck COL description VAL This is track nine of the only Bette Bright & The Illuminations album. It is now out of print and fairly pricey\, so here's a vinyl rip for your enjoyment. Bette Bright was originally a prominent vocalist with Liverpool legends Deaf School before her solo career. This album features the likes of Clive Langer\, Ian Broudie\, James Eller and Lee "Kix" Thompson of Madness. Bette Bright (real name Anne Martin) married Graham "Suggs" McPherson (no introduction necessary) and retired from music to start a family.

COL title VAL Twilight on the Trail COL performer VAL Dean Martin	COL video title VAL LURLEAN HUNTER  Vocal Jazz Swing. Steppin' Out With My Baby \, I Feel COL description VAL Lurlean Hunter  Singer Lurlean Hunter made five albums on her own during the second half of the '50s\, starting out as a Lonesome Gal on RCA and winding up still feeling Blue & Sentimental for Atlantic. She was discovered in Chicago where she had been singing in many clubs\, including a collaboration with drummer Red Saunders that held forth at the Club DeLisa. Hunter's move to New York City in 1955 was prompted by RCA's interest in recording her. The singer's recording career actually began before she left the Windy City at the behest of indie jazz labels\, some of them quite short-lived -- such as Seymour\, with a catalog topping out at four releases. The press described Hunter as a "blues thrush" in announcing her interpretations of three numbers actually written by the label's owner\, producer and record store owner Seymour Schwartz. The latter promotional blurb inevitably told some truth about Hunter's stylistic traits\, if not her relation to winged fauna. Her recordings were more about rhythm & blues and pop than jazz\, yet were done in an era when such sessions often involved fine mainstream jazz players in the accompaniment. The 1956Night Life\, for example\, featured pianist Hank Jones and tenor saxophonist Al Cohn. Blue & Sentimental -- with arrangements by the progressive Jimmy Giuffre -- was reissued in 2000 as a split CD also including an album by fellow singer Betty Bennett\, a former wife of pianist André Previn.Hunter's final recordings were done in 1964\, at which point she was still well under 40 years old. She is known to have died young\, although details of this tragedy are murky. In one version of the story she was knocked off by a mobster lover\, yet whether anybody was really that mean to Lurlean cannot be completely confirmed.

This album is hard to find and commands a decent price tag but it was re-issued a few years ago and should now be available to a larger audience at last.  In my opinion Ellie Pop were treading their own path in 1968\, there's no fuzz\, no psych touches\, no 1968isms of heavy guitars and keyboards. What you get is a collection of beautifully constructed pop songs that suggest a big Anglophile influence\, in particular mid-60s period Beatles. They sound similar to say The Merry-Go-Round or The Left Banke but without the baroque touches. Just pure pop\, or should I say Ellie Pop.  Virtually every review I've read online or in Shindig for instance\, fails to mention that 'Whatcha Gonna Do 'Bout It' is a cover of a Hollies cut they recorded in 1963 for their debut album 'Stay With The Hollies.' Ellie Pop wrote all of their own tunes except this one!  I'm not certain where Ellie Pop hailed from or even the full names of the group members but it has been suggested elsewhere that they were from Detroit. Maybe someone can confirm this?  http://expo67-cavestones.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/ellie-pop-whatcha-gonna-do-bout-it.html COL channel name VAL ACID REVOLVER	0

'Spirit of '73: Rock For Choice' was put together by the activist group Feminist Majority with proceeds going to support the Becky Bell/Rosie Jimenez Campaign "to lift consent laws and federal funding restrictions that are forcing young women to turn to back-alley abortions". The compilation's title is inspired by the January 22\, 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion in the United States. The songs included are all contemporary artists of 1995 covering songs that were popular in the early 1970s.   Fun Fact: The producer of the original "Midnight At The Oasis" by Maria Muldaur was none other than That Dog singer/guitarist Anna Waronker's father\, Lenny Waronker.

It is Holland (and not Kim Weston in 1965) who did the first recording of "Take me in Your Arms (Rock Me a Little While)" in 1964 but it was not released commercially until 2005\, even though Weston's cover was the first commercial release. Listen and compare how Weston's cover is almost similar to Holland's original version here.   http://fr.youtube.com/watch?v=h4SEm44Ee8A&feature=related  The better known version that people most remember is the Doobie Brothers' cover in 1975 which went up to number 11 on the Billboard Charts that year.

Now I had a woman Lord\, she lived down by the mine\, She ain't never seen the sun\, Oh Lord\, never stopped crying.  Then one day my woman up and died\, Lord\, she up and died now. Oh Lord\, she up and died now. She wanted to die\, And the only way to fly is die\, die\, die.

COL title VAL Love Supreme COL performer VAL Harry Manx	COL video title VAL A Love Supreme\, Part 1: Acknowledgement - John Coltrane (1965) COL description VAL "Part 1: Acknowledgement" was the first track on "A Love Supreme"\, a jazz studio album recorded by John Coltrane's classic quartet in December 1964 and released by Impulse! Records in February 1965.  It is generally considered to be among Coltrane's greatest works\, as it melded the hard bop sensibilities of his early career with the free jazz style he adopted later.  The quartet recorded the album in one session on December 9\, 1964\, at the Van Gelder Studio in Englewood Cliffs\, New Jersey.  The album is a four-part suite\, broken up into tracks: "Acknowledgement" (which contains the mantra that gave the suite its name)\, "Resolution"\, "Pursuance"\, and "Psalm".  It is intended to be a spiritual album\, broadly representative of a personal struggle for purity\, and expresses Coltrane's deep gratitude as he admits to his talent and instrument as being owned not by him but by a spiritual higher power.  The track begins the album with the bang of a gong\, or tam-tam\, followed by cymbal washes.  Jimmy Garrison follows on bass with the four-note motif which structures the entire movement\, after which Coltrane's solo follows.  Besides soloing upon variations of the motif\, at one point Coltrane repeats the four notes over and over in different modulations.  After many repetitions\, the motif becomes the vocal chant "A Love Supreme"\, sung by Coltrane\, accompanying himself via overdubs.  "A Love Supreme" is often listed amongst the greatest jazz albums of all time.  It was also quite popular for a jazz album\, selling about 500\,000 copies by 1970\, a number far exceeding Coltrane's typical Impulse! sales of around 30\,000.  As further testimony to the recording's historic significance\, the manuscript for the album is one of the National Museum of American History's 'Treasures of American History'\, part of the collection of the Smithsonian Institution.  The Penguin Guide to Jazz selected this album as part of its suggested 'Core Collection'\, stating "It is without precedent and parallel\, and though it must also be one of the best-loved jazz records of all time it somehow remains remote from critical pigeonholing" calling it "immensely concentrated and rich."  The album's influence has been extensive and diverse.  Musicians ranging from tenor Joshua Redman to the singer Bono of U2 have singled out the influence of the album on their own work.  Guitarists John McLaughlin and Carlos Santana have each credited the album as one of their greatest early influences.  John William Coltrane\, sometimes abbreviated 'Trane' (September 23\, 1926 -- July 17\, 1967)\, was an American jazz saxophonist and composer. He was beatified by the African Orthodox Church as Saint John William Coltrane.  Working in the bebop and hard bop idioms early in his career\, Coltrane helped pioneer the use of modes in jazz and later was at the forefront of free jazz.  He was prolific\, organizing at least fifty recording sessions as a leader during his recording career\, and appeared as a sideman on many other albums\, notably with trumpeter Miles Davis and pianist Thelonious Monk.  As his career progressed\, his music took on an increasingly spiritual dimension.  He influenced innumerable musicians\, and remains one of the most significant tenor saxophonists in jazz history.  Coltrane died from liver cancer at Huntington Hospital on Long Island on July 17\, 1967\, at the age of 40.  This channel is dedicated to the classic jazz music you've loved for years.

COL title VAL A Precious Little Thing Called Love COL performer VAL Lou Gold and His Orchestra	COL video title VAL David Bowie - Sorrow.mpg COL description VAL "Sorrow" is a song first recorded by The McCoys. It became a big hit in the United Kingdom in a version by The Merseys\, reaching number 4 in the UK charts on 28 April 1966. A version by David Bowie was also a hit in 1973. The song contains the lyric "with your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue"\, copied on the The Beatles' track "It's All Too Much" from Yellow Submarine.  David Bowie's remake of "Sorrow" was the only single released in the UK from the Pin Ups covers project\, reaching UK #3 and staying in the charts for 15 weeks. The B-side\, "Amsterdam"\, was a cover of a Jacques Brel song (originally called "Port of Amsterdam")\, had been performed live by Bowie since 1969\, and was recorded in 1971 for the Ziggy Stardust album. It was dropped from the final release\, but included as it fitted in with "Sorrow". In France\, it was billed as the A-side of the single. COL channel name VAL Dadeda	0

Visa ble presentert under turneen «Vers og viiiiiiser. Lyriske utskeielser ved Harald Sverdrup og Alf Cranner» i 1966\, og utgitt på LP året samme høst.   Sjømannsvise har blitt en av Cranners mest folkekjære viser\, og den har kommet på flere plateinnspillinger siden.   Den svenske trubaduren Cornelis Vreeswijk lagde en egen tekstversjon av Sjømannsvise som han kalt Ågren.   Han oppgav opprinnelig melodien som «norsk folketone»\, men førte opp Cranner som komponist da han gav ut visa på plata Poem\, ballader och lite blues i 1970.  En sjømannsvise er en vise om sjømenn og livet ombord\, eller en vise som er populær blant sjømenn.   Sjømannsviser kan deles i to grupper. Sjantier som var arbeidssangen ombord på seilskutene og frivaktsviser som var populære sanger blant sjømenn. COL channel name VAL Cauldron20	0

It is Holland (and not Kim Weston in 1965) who did the first recording of "Take me in Your Arms (Rock Me a Little While)" in 1964 but it was not released commercially until 2005\, even though Weston's cover was the first commercial release. Listen and compare how Weston's cover is almost similar to Holland's original version here.   http://fr.youtube.com/watch?v=h4SEm44Ee8A&feature=related  The better known version that people most remember is the Doobie Brothers' cover in 1975 which went up to number 11 on the Billboard Charts that year.

COL title VAL Close Every Door COL performer VAL Donny Osmond	COL video title VAL Henry Mancini -   Tiny Bubbles COL description VAL "I think there is a song out there to describe just about any situation."― Criss Jami ▼▼▼  HENRY MANCINI Enrico Nicola "Henry" Mancini was an American composer\, arranger and conductor\, who is best remembered for his film and television scores.  He won a record number of Grammy Awards\, plus a posthumous Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995. His best-known works include the jazz-idiom theme to The Pink Panther film series ("The Pink Panther Theme") and the theme to the Peter Gunn television series.  Mancini had a long collaboration with the film director Blake Edwards and won numerous Academy Awards for the songs in Edwards films\, including "Moon River" from Breakfast at Tiffany's\, "Days of Wine and Roses" and for the score to "Victor Victoria". Entering 1946\, Mancini became a pianist and arranger for the newly re-formed Glenn Miller Orchestra\, led by 'Everyman' Tex Beneke. After World War II\, Mancini broadened his skills in composition\, counterpoint\, harmony and orchestration during studies opening with the composers Ernst Krenek and Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco.  In 1952\, Mancini joined the Universal Pictures music department. During the next six years\, he contributed music to over 100 movies\, most notably The Creature from the Black Lagoon\, It Came from Outer Space\, Tarantula\, This Island Earth\, The Glenn Miller Story (for which he received his first Academy Award nomination)\, The Benny Goodman Story and Orson Welles' Touch of Evil. During this time\, he also wrote some popular songs. His first hit was a single by Guy Lombardo and His Royal Canadians titled I Won't Let You Out of My Heart. Mancini left Universal to work as an independent composer/arranger in 1958. Soon after\, he scored the television series Peter Gunn for writer/producer Blake Edwards. This was the genesis of a relationship in which Edwards and Mancini collaborated on 30 films over 35 years.  Along with Alex North\, Elmer Bernstein\, Leith Stevens and Johnny Mandel\, Henry Mancini was a pioneer of the inclusion of jazz elements in the late romantic orchestral film and TV scoring prevalent at the time. Mancini scored many TV movies\, including The Thorn Birds and The Shadow Box. He wrote many television themes\, including Mr. Lucky (starring John Vivyan and Ross Martin)\, NBC Mystery Movie\, What's Happening\, Tic Tac Dough (1990 version) and Once Is Not Enough. In the 1984--85 television season\, four series featured original Mancini themes: Newhart\, Hotel\, Remington Steele\, and Ripley's Believe It or Not. Mancini also composed the "Viewer Mail" theme for Late Night with David Letterman. Mancini composed the theme for NBC Nightly News used beginning in 1975\, and a different theme by him\, titled Salute to the President was used by NBC News for its election coverage (including primaries and conventions) from 1976 to 1992. Salute to the President was only published in a school-band arrangement\, although Mancini performed it frequently with symphony orchestras on his concert tours. Songs with music by Mancini were staples of the easy listening genre from the 1960s to the 1980s. Some of the artists who have recorded Mancini songs include Andy Williams\, Paul Anka\, Pat Boone\, Anita Bryant\, Jack Jones\, Frank Sinatra\, Perry Como\, Connie Francis\, Eydie Gorme\, Steve Lawrence\, Trini Lopez\, George Maharis\, Johnny Mathis\, Jerry Vale and Ray Conniff\, to name just a few.... Mancini recorded over 90 albums\, in styles ranging from big band to light classical to pop. Eight of these albums were certified gold by The Recording Industry Association of America. He had a 20-year contract with RCA Records\, resulting in 60 commercial record albums that made him a household name among artists of easy-listening music.  TINY BUBBLES "Tiny Bubbles" is a song written by Martin Denny and Leon Pober. It was released in 1966 by Don Ho.  It is widely considered to be Denny's most famous song.  MHO "Tiny Bubbles" is -\, with all due respect for Mr Denny\, a rather "simple" song but... hand the notes to a top arranger like Henry Mancini and .... what you get is a fabulous orchestral arrangement that\, in a way\, transforms the song into an easy floating ballad.  A particularly rich instrumentation with strings\, brass\, and all the other "standard" instruments of a large orchestra\, completed with the sound of the ukelele and harp\, so typical for the Hawaiian style music.  The Mancini chorus adds some warmth and "body" to the recording\, so\, in the end\, we get to hear a splendid version of this well known theme.   Have a great (musical) trip to "Aloha country" :) !  Enjoy. COL channel name VAL Socratess2007	0

COL title VAL Laura Palmer's Theme COL performer VAL Martin Tallstrom	COL video title VAL Betty Johnson -- I Need You Now (VintageMusic.es) COL description VAL Betty Johnson 16 de marzo 1929 (otras fuentes dicen 1931)  es una cantante norteamericana que alcanzó su pico de carrera en la década de 1950. Cuando era adolescente\, fue contratada por Columbia Records e hizo algunas grabaciones\, ninguna de las cuales tuvieron éxito. En 1951\, Percy Faith \, que la había conocido por sus grabaciones de Columbia\, trató de convencer a Mitch Miller ( A & R\, el director de Columbia) para firmar con ella\, pero Miller\, que incluye Doris Day y Rosemary Clooney \, entre los artistas que habían firmado\, no veía la necesidad firmar con ella.  Johnson lanzó el álbum para niños\, con Eddy Arnold producido por Simon and Schuster \, que posteriormente la contrató para su propio sello discográfico\, Bell Records en 1954. En el mismo año firmó un contrato con Csida-Grean\, una sociedad de gestión que había manejado la carrera de Arnold. Charles Grean\, miembro  de esa compañía\,  produjo muchas de sus grabaciones posteriores. En 1955\, firmó un contrato con RCA Victor Records \, que la envió a Chicago\, Illinois .  En Chicago\, Johnson trabajó con Arnold de nuevo en su  serie\, Eddy Arnold Time\, respaldado por un grupo que había trabajado con su familia en el Grand Ole Opry\, The Jordanaires . Este grupo más tarde fue conocido como un grupo de apoyo de Elvis Presley .  En 1957 se casó con Grean\, aunque el matrimonio sólo duraría hasta 1961\, la relación profesional continuó. Luego fue contratada por Jack Paar para su programa de televisión\, Tonight . Esto condujo a un contrato discográfico con Atlantic Records en 1957\, para el que tuvo su próximo gran éxito\, "Little Blue Man".  Johnson continuó en Tonight hasta 1962 cuando Jack Paar fue reemplazado por Johnny Carson.

All I hear is burn!  I didnt believe she was devils sperm. She said\, curse you all\, youll never learn! When I leave theres no return. The people laughed till she said\, burn! Warning came\, no one cared. Earth was shakin\, we stood and stared. When it came no one was spared. Still I hear burn!  You know we had no time\, We could not even try. You know we had no time.  You know we had no time\, We could not even try. You know we had no time.  The sky is red\, I dont understand\, Past midnight I still see the land.

COL title VAL Enola Gay COL performer VAL The Hillbilly Moon Explosion	COL video title VAL Staccatos - Just like Romeo and Juliet COL description VAL The Staccatos are a South African band formed in November 1961 by Brian Le Gassick. The original line-up consisted of Brian le Gassick – lead vocals\, guitar\, John Leach – lead guitar\, Willie van der Walt – bass and Ian Miller – drums. In 1962 Leach and van der Walt were replaced by Richard Crouse – guitar\, Jimmy Routledge – bass and Billy Andrews – vocals\, harmonica (Billy later became one half of the duo the “Dream Merchants” with Billy Forrest). In 1964 the Staccatos won the Transvaal Merseyside Contest\, which included a recording contract with EMI. They supported Peter and Gordon on their tour of South Africa in 1965.  In 1966 Steve Lonsdale took over the lead vocals\, and Richard Crouse married Wanda Arletti who joined the group for a tour of Zambia. In 1967 Eddie Boyle – bass\, and Ronnie Cline – organ\, joined the group. In 1968 Billy Forrest approached the group to record “Cry to me” for the film “Katrina”. This song became their biggest hit\, reaching number 1 on the South African Top 20 in 1969 and charting for a massive 38 weeks\, earning them a double gold disc.  In 1969 John Elliot – sax\, joined the group and in 1970 Ivor Black – drums and Peter Vee – lead vocals (Steve Lonsdale left for America).  This song is off the album “Come Back Silly Girl” released in 1965.  On this album the line-up was: Ian Miller (drums and group leader)\, Richard Crouse (lead guitar)\, Billy Andrews (lead vocals and harmonica)\, Jimmy Ryan (bass) and Brian le Gassick (rhythm guitar).

The musical is the fifth adaptation of the play Parfumerie by Hungarian playwright Miklos Laszlo\, following the 1940 James Stewart-Margaret Sullavan film The Shop around the Corner and the 1949 Judy Garland-Van Johnson musical version In the Good Old Summertime.   The 1978 BBC version starring Robin Ellis and Gemma Craven is worth watching too.  It would surface yet again in 1998 as the Tom Hanks-Meg Ryan feature You've Got Mail. The plot revolves around Budapest shop employees Georg Nowack and Amalia Balash who\, despite being consistently at odds with each other at work\, are unaware that each is the other's secret pen pal met through lonely-hearts ads. The musical premiered on Broadway in 1963\, and subsequently had productions in the West End in 1964 and award-winning revivals on each side of the Atlantic in the 1990s\, as well as regional productions. *** COL channel name VAL 65Seasons	0

It was released as a single and peaked at number 29 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart and number 1 on the Billboard Top Tracks chart. The song was Gabriel's first Top 40 hit in the US. In the UK\, the song charted at number 58. It was included on Gabriel's fourth self-titled album\, issued in the U.S. as Security. As well as its "relentlessly repeated hook" that "sounded nothing like anything else on the radio at the time"\, the track is known for its popular and somewhat disturbing music video featuring Gabriel (in white face paint) and a frightened-looking capuchin monkey.  Interpretation  Due to its title and the content of the video\, the song is frequently assumed to be either an animal rights song or a reference to the famous experiments by Stanley Milgram described in his book Obedience to Authority. It is neither\, although another Gabriel song\, "We Do What We're Told (Milgram's 37)"\, from his 1986 album So\, does deal directly with Milgram. Gabriel himself has described "Shock the Monkey" as "a love song" that examines how jealousy can release one's baser instincts; the monkey is not a literal monkey\, but a metaphor for one's feelings of jealousy.  Releases  "Shock the Monkey" was released as a 7" picture disc in addition to the 7" and 12" black vinyl singles. Club DJ remix service Hot Tracks crafted an 8:12 version that intersperses verses and choruses sung by Gabriel in German with the more familiar English lyrics. A concert version of the song appears on Gabriel's album Plays Live (1983). It is also included on the compilation albums Shaking the Tree (1990) and Hit (2003). The music video appears on the DVD compilation Play (2004).  Remix contest  An online contest was held in September 2006 by Realworld Remixed in which musicians and engineers were invited to submit a remix of the song. The original tracks were made available for download\, offering a rare opportunity to work with the raw material from a hit song. The winner was Multiman's "Simian Surprise".  Coal Chamber feat. Ozzy Osbourne version  The alternative metal band Coal Chamber covered "Shock the Monkey" on their 1999 album Chamber Music. The cover featured guest vocals by Ozzy Osbourne.  Music video  Directed by Dean Karr. It shows the band playing with Ozzy and it has shots of a Monkey.  Other cover versions  Hawaiian recording artist Don Ho covered "Shock the Monkey" on the 2002 compilation album When Pigs Fly: Songs You Never Thought You'd Hear.  Finnish metal band Suburban Tribe covered "Shock the Monkey" on their 2007 album Recollection.  The Vitamin String Quartet featured the song on their Peter Gabriel tribute album  Use in other media  "Shock the Monkey" is included in the opening sequence to the film\, Project X.  The song is used in the South Park episode "Raisins". After Wendy breaks up with Stan\, he asks Wendy's friend Bebe how to win her back. She tells Stan to "stand outside her window\, and play Peter Gabriel" (a reference to Lloyd Dobler's actions in the movie Say Anything)\, so he chooses this song to play on the boombox.

COL title VAL A Precious Little Thing Called Love COL performer VAL Jack Hylton and His Orchestra	COL video title VAL Roarin' 20s: Lou Gold's Orchestra - A Precious Little Thing Called Love\, 1928 COL description VAL Lou GOLD & His Orchestra\, vocal chorus by: Tom Frawley (Irving Kaufman) – A Precious Little Thing Called Love\, Fox-Trot from “A Shopworn Angel”\, Harmony 1928 (USA)  NOTE: Lou GOLD (1890 – 1950) American bandleader and pianist\, director of one of the most prolific recording bands during the hot-dance age in the US.  Born in Russia as Louis Goldwasser\, he arrived with his parents to the United States when he was 3 years old. Having started his career as a popular music pianist in bars and cinemas\, he then switched to bandleading his own orchestra\, which played  the early jazz and hot dance arrangements and novelty songs\, such as “Clap Yo 'Hands”\, “Do Do Do” (1926) or  Skadatin-Dee (Just a Funny Sound and a Melody) (1928)  accompanied by many fabulous singers of the time (Scrappy Lambert\, Irving Kaufman\, Arthur Fields\, Smith Ballew\, Gladys Rice and Franklyn Baur).  Among the soloists in his orchestra was a well-known banjo player Ralph Dexter. Gold worked from 1925 to 1930 and had 21 recording sessions at Harmony\, Imperial\, Crown\, Cameo\, Diva\, Perfect and Romeo. He also starred as Lou Gold & His Melody Men or Rex King and His Sovereigns. In 1930\, the disbanded Lou Gold’s ensamble went transformed into the Don Carlos Latin Orchestra\, which remained active for some time in American music market of the 1930s.  Today\, Lou Gold’s recordings are very much valued by collectors as pure examples of the hotttest dance style of the Roaring 20s\, albeit most of them had been cut in non-electrical versions (ignoring the mainstream\, Harmony Records continued production of the accoustical recordings deep into the late 1920s).

COL title VAL Trouble Man COL performer VAL Rickie Lee Jones	COL video title VAL Alf Cranner - Sjømannsvise - 1966 COL description VAL Sjømannsvise av Harald Sverdrup ble tonesatt av visekunstneren Alf Cranner.   Visa ble presentert under turneen «Vers og viiiiiiser. Lyriske utskeielser ved Harald Sverdrup og Alf Cranner» i 1966\, og utgitt på LP året samme høst.   Sjømannsvise har blitt en av Cranners mest folkekjære viser\, og den har kommet på flere plateinnspillinger siden.   Den svenske trubaduren Cornelis Vreeswijk lagde en egen tekstversjon av Sjømannsvise som han kalt Ågren.   Han oppgav opprinnelig melodien som «norsk folketone»\, men førte opp Cranner som komponist da han gav ut visa på plata Poem\, ballader och lite blues i 1970.  En sjømannsvise er en vise om sjømenn og livet ombord\, eller en vise som er populær blant sjømenn.   Sjømannsviser kan deles i to grupper. Sjantier som var arbeidssangen ombord på seilskutene og frivaktsviser som var populære sanger blant sjømenn. COL channel name VAL Cauldron20	0

Lyrics:  Helplessly hoping Her harlequin hovers nearby Awaiting a word Gasping at glimpses Of gentle true spirit He runs\, wishing he could fly Only to trip at the sound of good-bye  Wordlessly watching He waits by the window And wonders  At the empty place inside Heartlessly helping himself to her bad dreams He worries Did he hear a good-bye? Or even hello?  They are one person They are two alone They are three together They are for each other  Stand by the stairway You'll see something Certain to tell you confusion has its cost Love isn't lying It's loose in a lady who lingers Saying she is lost And choking on hello  They are one person They are two alone They are three together They are for each other COL channel name VAL Hoodoo You Love?	0

Link below COL description VAL https://youtu.be/gVrCs58PNUU This is a much better HD copy of the music\, plus Stay a Little Longer.  Westenr Swing music from the 1940s.  This has Noel Boggs on Steel\, which means after the war probably 1946. Alex Beshear on trumpet plays it without a mute.  That was quite unusual for him.  Also Tommy sings it.  When Bob made the Okey 78\, the vocalist was Danny Alguire\, who also played trumpet.  Tommy had joined the army when that session took play. So here we get to hear the way he would have done it.  Just wish the quality was better.  Notice the accordian?  Bob never used one in his recordings\, and I have to wonder where Noel plugged in his steel guitar.  Behind a tree?  Hot session\, though.

COL title VAL With My Eyes Wide Open I'm Dreaming COL performer VAL Hugo Winterhalter and His Orchestra	COL video title VAL 'With my eyes wide open I'm dreaming'--Patti Page 'Quartet' (1949) COL description VAL Recorded in November 1949\, this is a classic example of 'multiple' recording\, as opposed to multitrack recording.  At the time this record was made there were no multitrack tape recorders.  In fact\, the studio this was recorded at (most likely Reeves in New York City) had yet to acquire tape equipment; hence\, this recording was made by first recording part of the music on one lacquer disc\, then playing this disc back through a mixer while another part was played or sung live along with the playback\, the mix of these parts being then recorded onto a second lacquer disc.  This was done four times (original recording plus three overdubs) to produce the four vocal parts heard on this record.   Les Paul was the first to produce successful 'multiples' (as he called them)\, both technically and artistically\, and what his label Capitol nicknamed 'The New Sound' spawned a brief fad where other performers tried to mimic his recording technique on their records\, with varying degrees of success.  This record was one of the better ones\, and Patti Page had several hits with this type of sound. COL channel name VAL PerisphereRec	1

Mulligan's pianoless quartet of the early 1950s with trumpeter Chet Baker is still regarded as one of the more important cool jazz groups. Mulligan was also a skilled pianist and played several other reed instruments. "There are some words that have been kind of lost from modern usage that I would like to bring to my music and have striven all my life to do\, BEAUTY\, GRACE\, NOBILITY\, these are the things that music can bring to us\, as human beings.

Today the mysterious Taggy Matcher and Stix Records are proud to present his first album. After a first single covering two tracks of The Black Keys (2013)\, Taggy recently presented the song “My Man”\, alongside the young talented LMK. On this track\, he digs more into the Digital sound from the early 80s\, showing another side of his production scale.   Coming out late November\, this album called "Singasong" definitely explores even more into the various styles of Jamaican music.  http://www.favoriterec.com/2014/10/taggy-matcher-singasong-lp COL channel name VAL Favorite Recordings	0

COL title VAL Goodbye Blue Sky COL performer VAL Ann Wilson with Nancy Wilson	COL video title VAL Wailing Souls - Mother And Child COL description VAL "When Live On was released by Wailing Souls (Winston "Pipe" Matthews and  Llyod "Bread" McDonald in 1994\, many longtime fans of the Jamaican root duo felt it was too commercial\, too far to the pop side of things\, and the album was roundly criticised at the time. In retrospect\, it would have appeared that the Souls  may have been a decade ahead of time\, b'cos head today\, Live On sounds amazingly current with it's mix of roots\, funk\, soul\, jazz and pop \, and while it is true that it might be the least Jamaicans sounding of their albums\, with pedigree of crack island session players like Sly & Robbie\, Dwight Pinkney\, Sticky Thompson and Earl Lindo all over the tracks..."

COL title VAL Who Is She (And What Is She to You) COL performer VAL The Three Degrees	COL video title VAL Bill Withers - Who Is He (And What Is He to You) COL description VAL Bill Withers - Who Is He (And What Is He to You)  William Harrison "Bill" Withers\, Jr. (born July 4\, 1938) is an American singer-songwriter and musician who performed and recorded from 1970 until 1985. Some of his best-known songs are "Lean on Me"\, "Ain't No Sunshine"\, "Use Me"\, "Just the Two of Us"\, "Lovely Day"\, and "Grandma's Hands". His life was recently the subject of the documentary film Still Bill. Withers was born the youngest of thirteen children in the small coal-mining town of Slab Fork\, West Virginia. Raised in nearby Beckley\, West Virginia\, Withers was thirteen years old when his father died. He enlisted with the United States Navy at age eighteen and served for nine years\, during which time he became interested in singing and writing songs. Soon after his discharge from the Navy in 1970\, he relocated to Los Angeles for a musical career. Withers worked as an assembler for several different companies\, including Douglas Aircraft Corporation\, while recording demo tapes with his own money\, shopping them around and performing in clubs at night. When he debuted with the song "Ain't No Sunshine" he refused to resign his job because of his belief that the music business was a fickle industry and that he was still a novice compared to other acts.  Lyrics  A man we passed just tried to stare me down  And when I looked at you\, you looked at the ground  I don't know who he is but I think that you do   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   I have something in my heart and in your eyes  Tell me he's not someone just passin' by  And when you cleared your throat was that your cue   Dag gummit dag  Who is he and what is he to you   Now when I add the sum of you and me  I get confused and I keep coming up with three  You're too much for one man but not enough for two   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Hey you tell me man don't have not much for intuition  That what you really think or are you wishin'  Before you wreck your old home be certain of the new   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you COL channel name VAL Alf	1

COL title VAL It's Gonna Take a Miracle COL performer VAL The Manhattan Transfer with Bette Midler	COL video title VAL Open the Door\, Richard (#1 hit version) - The Three Flames COL description VAL Another version of "Open the Door Richard" by the Three Flames.

I'm adding this to clear up some misinformation about this song....  Clinton "Dusty" Fletcher was an African-American vaudeville performer. He created the "Open The Door Richard" routine. It was Jack McVea who put the routine to music and recorded it. It became a huge hit in the late 1940s and was covered by many different bands. Dusty Fletcher even released his own two sided disc of it. COL channel name VAL geofbrit59	0

It was also used as the B-side of their 1967 single "All You Need Is Love". New mixes of the song were made available on the compilation albums Magical Mystery Tour and Yellow Submarine Songtrack.  Composition  Two song fragments were combined to create "Baby\, You're a Rich Man". The verses from "One of the Beautiful People" by John Lennon were combined with Paul McCartney's previously unaccompanied "Baby\, you're a rich man ..." chorus. Two songs were combined in a similar fashion to make "A Day in the Life"\, and "I've Got a Feeling".  Recording  The song was recorded and mixed (in mono) on 11 May 1967 at Olympic Sound Studios. The music featured an unusual oboe-like sound which was created with a clavioline (an early forerunner of the synthesiser) and a spin-echo (feed back delay) effect which was used to fill from the end of one line of the verse to the start of the next.  Personnel  Per Lewisohn & MacDonald:  John Lennon -- double-tracked vocal\, clavioline\, piano Paul McCartney -- harmony vocal\, piano\, bass George Harrison -- harmony vocal\, guitar\, handclaps Ringo Starr -- drums\, tambourine\, maracas\, handclaps Brian Jones -- oboe Eddie Kramer -- vibraphone George Martin -- producer Keith Grant -- engineer  Mick Jagger was also present and his name appears on a session tape box\, possibly indicating that he provided backing vocals near the end of the song.

Now that you know who you are What do you want to be? And have you travelled very far? Far as the eye can see. How does it feel to be One of the beautiful people? How often have you been there? Often enough to know. What did you see\, when you were there? Nothing that doesn't show. Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man too. You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo. What a thing to do. Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man too. How does it feel to be One of the beautiful people? Tuned to a natural E Happy to be that way. Now that you've found another key What are you going to play? Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man too. You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo. What a thing to do. Baby you're a rich man...

Banes Drums\, Percussion -- Jimmy Young  ------------------------  "Fire" is a 1968 song by Arthur Brown\, Vincent Crane\, Mike Finesilver and Peter Ker. Performed by The Crazy World of Arthur Brown\, it was released as a single and on the band's debut album\, also called The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. The single made #1 in the UK (in August 1968) and Canada. In October\, it made #2 in the US Billboard charts and #19 in Australia. It also made #6 in the Netherlands. "Fire" sold over one million copies\, and was awarded a gold disc.  The song is an example of the psychedelic rock of the period\, though its lack of guitars or bass guitar distinguished it from many of its contemporaries. The lead instrument in this case was Vincent Crane's Hammond electronic organ\, augmented by an orchestral section featuring prominent brass. The singer's opening proclamation of himself as "the god of hellfire" became a lasting epithet. The song's other memorable line is "You're Gonna Burn!!". The song ends with the sound of a wind from hell.  During live performances and in the black and white promotional television clip\, Brown performed the song wearing a burning helmet. The helmet was improvised with a leather skull cap onto which was bolted a metal dish that held lighter fluid or petrol. As the cap was not insulated\, the heat from the burning fuel quickly conducted through the fixing bolt to the top of Brown's head\, causing him considerable pain.  Two studio mixes of "Fire" have been officially released\, one in stereo and one in mono. The mono mix features no brass. Both versions are included on the CD reissue of The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. The single B-side\, "Rest Cure"\, was another track from the album.  Credit for the composition of "Fire" on the original vinyl single was to Arthur Brown and Vincent Crane only; however\, Mike Finesilver and Peter Ker successfully sued for co-credit and royalties based on melodic similarities to their song "Baby\, You're a Long Way Behind".  The song is briefly featured in the films Hot Fuzz (2007) and The Boat That Rocked (2009). It is also referenced in Julie Hearn's debut novel Follow Me Down\, and was used in the episode "Burn Victim" of My Name Is Earl.  Cover versions  The Ventures covered the song on their 1969 album Underground Fire. Lizzy Mercier Descloux covered "Fire" on her album Press Color (1979)\, drastically changing the mood and style of the track. Pete Townshend\, the single's associate producer\, covered "Fire" as a member of The Who on his 1989 album The Iron Man: A Musical. Cirith Ungol covered the song on their 1991 album Paradise Lost. The Prodigy sampled the track for "Fire/Jericho"\, which was otherwise a completely different song\, on their 1992 album Experience. Emerson\, Lake & Palmer covered the song on their 1993 4-disc compilation album The Return of the Manticore. German dark electro act AmGod covered the song several times. The most well-known version is "Fire v.2" featured on the 1994 album Half Rotten and Decayed. Though it was not a true 'cover'\, Marilyn Manson's "Lunchbox" (1995) heavily samples "Fire". UK doom metal band Cathedral covered the song on their 1996 EP Hopkins (The Witchfinder General). Die Krupps covered the song on their 1997 album Paradise Now. Dutch death metal band God Dethroned covered the song on their 1997 album The Grand Grimoire. Ozzy Osbourne included a version on his 2005 album Under Cover. The song is used in one episode of Series 3 of Monkey Dust (2005) as the Paedofinder General burns the wrongly accused paedophiles with this music in the background\, complete with bastardised lyrics. US Hip hop duo Cunninlynguists sampled the song for "Hellfire" on their 2006 album A Piece of Strange. Leningrad Cowboys covered the song in a metal style and included it on their 2006 album Zombie's Paradise. Appears in the musical Disco Inferno\, when the character Duke reveals himself to be Satan in disguise.[citation needed] Death Grips\, an experimental hip hop group backed by drummer Zach Hill\, sampled "Fire" in their song "Lord of the Game".

In 1948\, Cornelis was toen elf jaar oud\, verhuisde het gezin naar Stockholm in Zweden waar zijn vader\, Jacob Cornelis Vreeswijk\, nadat hij in Nederland een taxi- en garagebedrijf had gehad\, ging werken als automonteur. Het gezin remigreerde in 1961 naar Nederland\, maar Cornelis en zijn zuster Ida bleven in Zweden wonen.  Vreeswijk debuteerde in 1964 met Ballader och oförskämdheter (Ballades en onbeschaamdheden). Zijn grote doorbraak kwam in 1968 met Tio vackra visor och personliga Person (Tien mooie liederen en 'persoonlijke Person'\, een woordspeling op een Zweedse achternaam). Hij nam ook liederen op van Carl Michael Bellman (1740-1795\, een Zweeds dichter) en Evert Taube (1890 - 1976)\, zijn directe voorganger als belangrijkste Zweedse troubadour.  Ook na zijn dood bleef Vreeswijks oeuvre in Zweden ongekend populair\, getuige ook de nationale Cornelis Vreeswijkdag aldaar.  Vreeswijk werd in 1966 door de VARA uitgenodigd naar Nederland te komen. Een single van De nozem en de non flopte. Zes jaar later verscheen zijn elpee Cornelis Vreeswijk (1972) die bekroond werd met platina; er werden honderdduizend exemplaren van verkocht. Zijn volgende Nederlandstalige platen hadden echter maar weinig succes.  In 1973 verscheen zijn LP I stället för vykort (In plaats van ansichtkaarten)\, waarop hij stelling nam tegen de oorlog in Vietnam. Teksten van Victor Jara werden door hem in 1978 op de plaat gezet.  In 1974 reikte Prins Adrianus I van carnavalsvereniging de Pintenwippers uit IJmuiden aan Vreeswijk het grootkruis der Pintenwippers uit.  In 1985 werd bij Vreeswijk leverkanker geconstateerd. Hij stierf twee jaar later op 50-jarige leeftijd COL channel name VAL Tjerk T.	0

It is Holland (and not Kim Weston in 1965) who did the first recording of "Take me in Your Arms (Rock Me a Little While)" in 1964 but it was not released commercially until 2005\, even though Weston's cover was the first commercial release. Listen and compare how Weston's cover is almost similar to Holland's original version here.   http://fr.youtube.com/watch?v=h4SEm44Ee8A&feature=related  The better known version that people most remember is the Doobie Brothers' cover in 1975 which went up to number 11 on the Billboard Charts that year.

COL title VAL Just a Little Lovin' (Will Go a Long Way) COL performer VAL Chris Scruggs	COL video title VAL John Lennon - (Just Like) Starting Over - Original Vinyl Single 45 rpm. GEF49604 COL description VAL It's a original 1980 single 45 rpm of John Lennon (Just Like) Starting Over with B side Kiss Kiss Kiss of Yoko Ono by the label Geffen Records . This was the first single released from Double Fantasy\, and the first new recording Lennon had released since 1975. It was chosen by Lennon not because he felt it was the best track on the album\, but because it was the most appropriate following his five year absence from the recording industry. He referred to it during production as the "Elvis/Orbison" track\, as he "tongue in cheek" impersonated their vocal styles. The uplifting bell at the intro of the song serves as the antidote to the morose bell sound which opens Lennon's first solo album\, Lennon seeing it as his having come full circle.

I'm adding this to clear up some misinformation about this song....  Clinton "Dusty" Fletcher was an African-American vaudeville performer. He created the "Open The Door Richard" routine. It was Jack McVea who put the routine to music and recorded it. It became a huge hit in the late 1940s and was covered by many different bands. Dusty Fletcher even released his own two sided disc of it. COL channel name VAL geofbrit59	0

DeBlanc was born in Austin\, Texas\,[2] the featured vocalist on recordings from Steve Gibson and the Red Caps during the 1950s.[3] She later went on to marry Gibson\, but they parted ways professionally and personally in 1959.  Credited as simply Damita Jo\, DeBlanc had some chart success in the early 1960s with two answer songs: 1960's "I'll Save the Last Dance for You" (an answer to "Save the Last Dance for Me") and 1961's "I'll Be There" (an answer to "Stand By Me"). Both songs were originally sung by Ben E. King and made the R&B top 20\, and "I'll Be There" also reached number 12 on the pop chart. In 1962 she recorded "Dance With a Dolly (With a Hole in her Stocking)"\, previously made famous by The Andrews Sisters and Bill Haley\, for Mercury Records. In 1966 she had a minor hit with a cover of the Jacques Brel song "If You Go Away."  She worked with Ray Charles\, Count Basie\, and Lionel Hampton. And\, in 1963\, she released a recording for Mercury Records with Billy Eckstine and Bobby Tucker Orchestra.  Damita Jo was later involved in comedy and toured with Redd Foxx. In 1998\, she suffered a respiratory illness and died on Christmas Day[2] in Baltimore\, Maryland. COL channel name VAL AMNON SUODAI	1

Annette sang this song in her only film appearance-a short 1.41 clip from a Captain Henry's Showboat 1933 program.  It became her trademark song.

COL title VAL Question COL performer VAL Fish	COL video title VAL John Fogerty - Have Thine Own Way\, Lord.wmv COL description VAL The Blue Ridge Rangers Is the first solo album by John Fogerty\, the former lead singer and lead guitarist of Creedence Clearwater Revival. Upon its initial release by Fantasy Records in 1973\, the album was credited to "The Blue Ridge Rangers" with no mention of Fogerty on the cover. Fogerty chose to do this in order to distance himself from his Creedence legacy. The LP was later reissued and credited to John Fogerty with a different cover design. The CD reissue restores the original silhouette cover photo and credits the album to Fogerty. The album is made up entirely of traditional and country covers\, and features Fogerty playing all the instruments. The album peaked at #47 on the charts. Two singles from the album became hits: "Jambalaya" which peaked at #16\, and "Hearts of Stone" which peaked at #37. In 2009\, Fogerty released a sequel to this album\, entitled The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again.  Track listing Side one 1. "Blue Ridge Mountain Blues" (Traditional) -- 2:29 2. "Somewhere Listening (For My Name)" (Archie Brownlee) -- 2:37 3. "You're the Reason" (Fred Henley\, Terry Fell\, Mildred Imes\, Bobby Edwards) - 3:12 4.

Reefer Songs. Flashbacks 1920's - 1940's Novelty Songs Of An Era Long Gone Bye. Drug Songs. Lil Green (December 22\, 1919 -- April 14\, 1954) was an American blues singer and songwriter. Originally named Lillian Green\, she was born in Mississippi; after the early deaths of her parents\, she went to Chicago\, Illinois\, where she began performing in her teens and where she would make all of her recordings. Green was noted for superb timing and a distinctively sinuous voice. She was 18 when she recorded her first session for the 35 cent Bluebird subsidiary of RCA. In the 1930s she and Big Bill Broonzy had a night club act together.[1] Her two biggest hits were\, firstly\, her own composition "Romance in the Dark" (1940)\, which was later covered by many artists\, such as Dinah Washington and Nina Simone (in 1967)\, although Billie Holiday also recorded a different song with the same name. Then came Green's own (1941) version of Kansas Joe McCoy's minor key blues and jazz influenced song\, "Why Don't You Do Right?"\, which was covered by Peggy Lee in 1942 and many others since. As well as performing in Chicago clubs\, Green toured with Tiny Bradshaw and other bands\, but never really broke away from the black theatre circuit. Although Green signed with Atlantic Records in 1951\, she was already in poor health. She died in Chicago in 1954 of pneumonia\, at the age of 34\, and is buried in Oak Hill Cemetery in Gary\, Indiana. Big Bill Broonzy (June 26\, 1903 -- August 15\, 1958) was a prolific American blues singer\, songwriter and guitarist. His career began in the 1920s when he played country blues to mostly black audiences. Through the '30s and '40s he successfully navigated a transition in style to a more urban blues sound popular with white audiences. In the 1950s a return to his traditional folk-blues roots made him one of the leading figures of the emerging American folk music revival and an international star. His long and varied career marks him as one of the key figures in the development of blues music in the 20th century. COL channel name VAL warholsoup100	0

Great big furry back and furry hair\, I think I'll call it a bear.  Man gave names to all the animals\, In the beginning\, in the beginning. Man gave names to all the animals\, In the beginning\, a long time ago.  He saw an animal up on the hill\, Chewing up so much grass until she was filled.

Man gave names to all the animals\, In the beginning\, a long time ago.  He saw an animal that liked to snort\, Horns on his head and they weren't too short.

Man gave names to all the animals\, In the beginning\, a long time ago.  He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail\, Real dirty face and a curly tail.

Man gave names to all the animals\, In the beginning\, a long time ago.  Next animal that he did meet\, Had wool on his back and hooves on his feet. Eating grass on a mountain side so steep\, He said I'm gonna call that one a sheep.  Man gave names to all the animals\, In the beginning\, in the beginning.

COL title VAL Some Broken Hearts COL performer VAL Bellamy Brothers	COL video title VAL Gerry Mulligan - Manoir Des Mes Reves (Django's Castle) COL description VAL Gerald Joseph "Gerry" Mulligan (April 6\, 1927 – January 20\, 1996) was an American jazz saxophonist\, clarinetist\, composer and arranger.[1] Though Mulligan is primarily known as one of the leading baritone saxophonists in jazz history – playing the instrument with a light and airy tone in the era of cool jazz – he was also a notable arranger\, working with Claude Thornhill\, Miles Davis\, Stan Kenton\, and others. Mulligan's pianoless quartet of the early 1950s with trumpeter Chet Baker is still regarded as one of the more important cool jazz groups. Mulligan was also a skilled pianist and played several other reed instruments. "There are some words that have been kind of lost from modern usage that I would like to bring to my music and have striven all my life to do\, BEAUTY\, GRACE\, NOBILITY\, these are the things that music can bring to us\, as human beings. I think it is well that we who make music keep that in our consciousness." -GERRY MULLIGAN COL channel name VAL Music Legends Book	0
COL title VAL Steppin' Out with My Baby COL performer VAL Fred Astaire	COL video title VAL LURLEAN HUNTER  Vocal Jazz Swing. Steppin' Out With My Baby \, I Feel COL description VAL Lurlean Hunter  Singer Lurlean Hunter made five albums on her own during the second half of the '50s\, starting out as a Lonesome Gal on RCA and winding up still feeling Blue & Sentimental for Atlantic. She was discovered in Chicago where she had been singing in many clubs\, including a collaboration with drummer Red Saunders that held forth at the Club DeLisa. Hunter's move to New York City in 1955 was prompted by RCA's interest in recording her. The singer's recording career actually began before she left the Windy City at the behest of indie jazz labels\, some of them quite short-lived -- such as Seymour\, with a catalog topping out at four releases. The press described Hunter as a "blues thrush" in announcing her interpretations of three numbers actually written by the label's owner\, producer and record store owner Seymour Schwartz. The latter promotional blurb inevitably told some truth about Hunter's stylistic traits\, if not her relation to winged fauna. Her recordings were more about rhythm & blues and pop than jazz\, yet were done in an era when such sessions often involved fine mainstream jazz players in the accompaniment. The 1956Night Life\, for example\, featured pianist Hank Jones and tenor saxophonist Al Cohn. Blue & Sentimental -- with arrangements by the progressive Jimmy Giuffre -- was reissued in 2000 as a split CD also including an album by fellow singer Betty Bennett\, a former wife of pianist André Previn.Hunter's final recordings were done in 1964\, at which point she was still well under 40 years old. She is known to have died young\, although details of this tragedy are murky. In one version of the story she was knocked off by a mobster lover\, yet whether anybody was really that mean to Lurlean cannot be completely confirmed.

Tender is the night So tender is the night There's no one in the world Except the two of us. Should tomorrow  Find us disenchanted We have shared a love That few have known.

COL title VAL Hide and Seek COL performer VAL Fightstar	COL video title VAL John Fogerty - Have Thine Own Way\, Lord.wmv COL description VAL The Blue Ridge Rangers Is the first solo album by John Fogerty\, the former lead singer and lead guitarist of Creedence Clearwater Revival. Upon its initial release by Fantasy Records in 1973\, the album was credited to "The Blue Ridge Rangers" with no mention of Fogerty on the cover. Fogerty chose to do this in order to distance himself from his Creedence legacy. The LP was later reissued and credited to John Fogerty with a different cover design. The CD reissue restores the original silhouette cover photo and credits the album to Fogerty. The album is made up entirely of traditional and country covers\, and features Fogerty playing all the instruments. The album peaked at #47 on the charts. Two singles from the album became hits: "Jambalaya" which peaked at #16\, and "Hearts of Stone" which peaked at #37. In 2009\, Fogerty released a sequel to this album\, entitled The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again.  Track listing Side one 1. "Blue Ridge Mountain Blues" (Traditional) -- 2:29 2.

This song is one of my favorites by CSN and the harmonies are particularly good. Just sit back\, listen and enjoy a truly beautiful song with great lyrics.  Lyrics:  Helplessly hoping Her harlequin hovers nearby Awaiting a word Gasping at glimpses Of gentle true spirit He runs\, wishing he could fly Only to trip at the sound of good-bye  Wordlessly watching He waits by the window And wonders  At the empty place inside Heartlessly helping himself to her bad dreams He worries Did he hear a good-bye? Or even hello?  They are one person They are two alone They are three together They are for each other  Stand by the stairway You'll see something Certain to tell you confusion has its cost Love isn't lying It's loose in a lady who lingers Saying she is lost And choking on hello  They are one person They are two alone They are three together They are for each other COL channel name VAL Hoodoo You Love?	0

Some day you'll return to  Your valleys and your farms  And you'll no longer burn  To be brothers in arms.    Through these fields of destruction  Baptism of fire  I've witnessed your suffering  As the battle raged higher.  And though they did hurt me so bad  In my fear and alarm  You did not desert me  My brothers in arms.    There's so many different worlds  So many different suns  And we have just one world  But we live in different ones.    Now the sun's gone to hell  And the moon's riding high  Let me bid you farewell  Every man has to die.  But it's written in the starlight  And every line in your palm  We're fools to make war  On our brothers in arms... COL channel name VAL UFCHeadhunter	1

COL title VAL 18 anni COL performer VAL Dalida	COL video title VAL A Love Supreme\, Part 1: Acknowledgement - John Coltrane (1965) COL description VAL "Part 1: Acknowledgement" was the first track on "A Love Supreme"\, a jazz studio album recorded by John Coltrane's classic quartet in December 1964 and released by Impulse! Records in February 1965.  It is generally considered to be among Coltrane's greatest works\, as it melded the hard bop sensibilities of his early career with the free jazz style he adopted later.  The quartet recorded the album in one session on December 9\, 1964\, at the Van Gelder Studio in Englewood Cliffs\, New Jersey.  The album is a four-part suite\, broken up into tracks: "Acknowledgement" (which contains the mantra that gave the suite its name)\, "Resolution"\, "Pursuance"\, and "Psalm".  It is intended to be a spiritual album\, broadly representative of a personal struggle for purity\, and expresses Coltrane's deep gratitude as he admits to his talent and instrument as being owned not by him but by a spiritual higher power.  The track begins the album with the bang of a gong\, or tam-tam\, followed by cymbal washes.  Jimmy Garrison follows on bass with the four-note motif which structures the entire movement\, after which Coltrane's solo follows.  Besides soloing upon variations of the motif\, at one point Coltrane repeats the four notes over and over in different modulations.  After many repetitions\, the motif becomes the vocal chant "A Love Supreme"\, sung by Coltrane\, accompanying himself via overdubs.  "A Love Supreme" is often listed amongst the greatest jazz albums of all time.  It was also quite popular for a jazz album\, selling about 500\,000 copies by 1970\, a number far exceeding Coltrane's typical Impulse! sales of around 30\,000.  As further testimony to the recording's historic significance\, the manuscript for the album is one of the National Museum of American History's 'Treasures of American History'\, part of the collection of the Smithsonian Institution.  The Penguin Guide to Jazz selected this album as part of its suggested 'Core Collection'\, stating "It is without precedent and parallel\, and though it must also be one of the best-loved jazz records of all time it somehow remains remote from critical pigeonholing" calling it "immensely concentrated and rich."  The album's influence has been extensive and diverse.  Musicians ranging from tenor Joshua Redman to the singer Bono of U2 have singled out the influence of the album on their own work.  Guitarists John McLaughlin and Carlos Santana have each credited the album as one of their greatest early influences.  John William Coltrane\, sometimes abbreviated 'Trane' (September 23\, 1926 -- July 17\, 1967)\, was an American jazz saxophonist and composer. He was beatified by the African Orthodox Church as Saint John William Coltrane.  Working in the bebop and hard bop idioms early in his career\, Coltrane helped pioneer the use of modes in jazz and later was at the forefront of free jazz.  He was prolific\, organizing at least fifty recording sessions as a leader during his recording career\, and appeared as a sideman on many other albums\, notably with trumpeter Miles Davis and pianist Thelonious Monk.  As his career progressed\, his music took on an increasingly spiritual dimension.  He influenced innumerable musicians\, and remains one of the most significant tenor saxophonists in jazz history.  Coltrane died from liver cancer at Huntington Hospital on Long Island on July 17\, 1967\, at the age of 40.  This channel is dedicated to the classic jazz music you've loved for years.

COL title VAL Funny\, Familiar\, Forgotten Feelings COL performer VAL Dottie West	COL video title VAL Staccatos - Houston COL description VAL The Staccatos are a South African band formed in November 1961 by Brian Le Gassick. The original line-up consisted of Brian le Gassick – lead vocals\, guitar\, John Leach – lead guitar\, Willie van der Walt – bass and Ian Miller – drums. In 1962 Leach and van der Walt were replaced by Richard Crouse – guitar\, Jimmy Routledge – bass and Billy Andrews – vocals\, harmonica (Billy later became one half of the duo the “Dream Merchants” with Billy Forrest). In 1964 the Staccatos won the Transvaal Merseyside Contest\, which included a recording contract with EMI. They supported Peter and Gordon on their tour of South Africa in 1965.  In 1966 Steve Lonsdale took over the lead vocals\, and Richard Crouse married Wanda Arletti who joined the group for a tour of Zambia. In 1967 Eddie Boyle – bass\, and Ronnie Cline – organ\, joined the group. In 1968 Billy Forrest approached the group to record “Cry to me” for the film “Katrina”. This song became their biggest hit\, reaching number 1 on the South African Top 20 in 1969 and charting for a massive 38 weeks\, earning them a double gold disc.  In 1969 John Elliot – sax\, joined the group and in 1970 Ivor Black – drums and Peter Vee – lead vocals (Steve Lonsdale left for America).  This song is off the album “Come Back Silly Girl” released in 1965. It's a cover of a Dean Martin song from 1965.  On this album the line-up was: Ian Miller (drums and group leader)\, Richard Crouse (lead guitar)\, Billy Andrews (lead vocals and harmonica)\, Jimmy Ryan (bass) and Brian le Gassick (rhythm guitar).

COL title VAL Barn av regnbuen COL performer VAL Lillebjørn Nilsen	COL video title VAL LURLEAN HUNTER  Vocal Jazz Swing. Steppin' Out With My Baby \, I Feel COL description VAL Lurlean Hunter  Singer Lurlean Hunter made five albums on her own during the second half of the '50s\, starting out as a Lonesome Gal on RCA and winding up still feeling Blue & Sentimental for Atlantic. She was discovered in Chicago where she had been singing in many clubs\, including a collaboration with drummer Red Saunders that held forth at the Club DeLisa. Hunter's move to New York City in 1955 was prompted by RCA's interest in recording her. The singer's recording career actually began before she left the Windy City at the behest of indie jazz labels\, some of them quite short-lived -- such as Seymour\, with a catalog topping out at four releases. The press described Hunter as a "blues thrush" in announcing her interpretations of three numbers actually written by the label's owner\, producer and record store owner Seymour Schwartz. The latter promotional blurb inevitably told some truth about Hunter's stylistic traits\, if not her relation to winged fauna. Her recordings were more about rhythm & blues and pop than jazz\, yet were done in an era when such sessions often involved fine mainstream jazz players in the accompaniment. The 1956Night Life\, for example\, featured pianist Hank Jones and tenor saxophonist Al Cohn. Blue & Sentimental -- with arrangements by the progressive Jimmy Giuffre -- was reissued in 2000 as a split CD also including an album by fellow singer Betty Bennett\, a former wife of pianist André Previn.Hunter's final recordings were done in 1964\, at which point she was still well under 40 years old. She is known to have died young\, although details of this tragedy are murky. In one version of the story she was knocked off by a mobster lover\, yet whether anybody was really that mean to Lurlean cannot be completely confirmed.

COL title VAL Baby COL performer VAL Tyler Ward	COL video title VAL Jessica Williams - Green Chimneys (T.Monk) COL description VAL Review from allmusic:  «Recorded at a special afternoon series sponsored by Chemekata College in Oregon\, Jazz in the Afternoon is a trio date\, with Williams joined by Dave Captein on bass and Mel Brown on drums. The recording is surprisingly dense however\, with Williams spraying notes all over on her solo for the Monk tune "Green Chimneys" which opens the set. Captein and Brown both sound enthused by the sprightly playing and keep up the pace admirably. Williams changes directions often\, moving with a smooth grace from the stately "Light Blue" (another Monk piece) to a barreling "Straight\, No Chaser" (ditto\, obviously) to Gershwin's playful "Swanee." Her playing never falters throughout the 70-minute recording. Though Williams recorded several excellent live albums\, Jazz in the Afternoon is another great addition to her discography. » COL channel name VAL André Rodrigues Pereira da Silva	0

COL title VAL Crazy COL performer VAL Iron Savior	COL video title VAL Elly Lapp - Ich weiß es wird einmal ein Wunder gescheh'n COL description VAL Elly Lapp Ganz nah  Genre: Deutsch-Pop\, Chanson\, Schlager   „Eine Stimme die unter die Haut geht.  Eindringlich\, lasziv\, ganz nah."   Elly Lapp liebt die Brückenschläge. Für sie sind UFA-Schlager und Popmusik keine  unarrangierbaren Gegensätze\, sondern interpretatorische Herausforderung. Dabei ist eine sehr moderne CD entstanden\,  die gleichzeitig sehr intensiv und sehr persönlich ist. Viel näher geht`s nicht.   Es waren große Songs -- es sind große Songs. Dazu leistet eine interessante Interpretin ihren Beitrag. Elly Lapp. Die studierte Schauspielerin und Sängerin tourt mit eigenen Programmen durch Deutschland -- und sie war die Stimme des Titelsongs der erfolgreichen ARD-Fernsehserie „Kir Royal".  „Der Wind hat mir ein Lied erzählt" - gleichzeitig erste Single - und „Ich steh` im Regen" sind Versuche einer ungewöhnlichen Verbindung von UFA - HIT und POPSOUND. Zarah Leander machte einst diese Songs zu Welterfolgen. Damals hatten die Autoren wohl nie eine Umsetzung mit rockigen Gitarren oder Saxophon im Auge. Hier geben die modernen Instrumente\, wie das gesamte Pop- Arrangement\, eine ganz neue Farbe -- voller Intensität.  Doch die CD von Elly Lapp zeigt die großen Filmhits nicht nur im Popgewand\, sondern auch sehr sparsam\, kunstvoll arrangiert\, als Chansons mit großer interpretatorischer Tiefe.  z.B." Wenn ich mir was wünschen dürfte" und - vor allem - „Der Nowack lässt mich nicht verkommen" -\, ein wahrer Kultsong\, 1959 geschrieben\, sofort auf Schallplatte aufgenommen\, kurzerhand von einem Münchner Gericht verboten und wieder eingestampft -- eine echte Rarität für jedes Rundfunk- und Privatarchiv!

Some day you'll return to  Your valleys and your farms  And you'll no longer burn  To be brothers in arms.    Through these fields of destruction  Baptism of fire  I've witnessed your suffering  As the battle raged higher.  And though they did hurt me so bad  In my fear and alarm  You did not desert me  My brothers in arms.    There's so many different worlds  So many different suns  And we have just one world  But we live in different ones.    Now the sun's gone to hell  And the moon's riding high  Let me bid you farewell  Every man has to die.  But it's written in the starlight  And every line in your palm  We're fools to make war  On our brothers in arms... COL channel name VAL UFCHeadhunter	0

Banes Drums\, Percussion -- Jimmy Young  ------------------------  "Fire" is a 1968 song by Arthur Brown\, Vincent Crane\, Mike Finesilver and Peter Ker. Performed by The Crazy World of Arthur Brown\, it was released as a single and on the band's debut album\, also called The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. The single made #1 in the UK (in August 1968) and Canada. In October\, it made #2 in the US Billboard charts and #19 in Australia. It also made #6 in the Netherlands. "Fire" sold over one million copies\, and was awarded a gold disc.  The song is an example of the psychedelic rock of the period\, though its lack of guitars or bass guitar distinguished it from many of its contemporaries. The lead instrument in this case was Vincent Crane's Hammond electronic organ\, augmented by an orchestral section featuring prominent brass. The singer's opening proclamation of himself as "the god of hellfire" became a lasting epithet. The song's other memorable line is "You're Gonna Burn!!". The song ends with the sound of a wind from hell.  During live performances and in the black and white promotional television clip\, Brown performed the song wearing a burning helmet. The helmet was improvised with a leather skull cap onto which was bolted a metal dish that held lighter fluid or petrol. As the cap was not insulated\, the heat from the burning fuel quickly conducted through the fixing bolt to the top of Brown's head\, causing him considerable pain.  Two studio mixes of "Fire" have been officially released\, one in stereo and one in mono. The mono mix features no brass. Both versions are included on the CD reissue of The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. The single B-side\, "Rest Cure"\, was another track from the album.  Credit for the composition of "Fire" on the original vinyl single was to Arthur Brown and Vincent Crane only; however\, Mike Finesilver and Peter Ker successfully sued for co-credit and royalties based on melodic similarities to their song "Baby\, You're a Long Way Behind".  The song is briefly featured in the films Hot Fuzz (2007) and The Boat That Rocked (2009). It is also referenced in Julie Hearn's debut novel Follow Me Down\, and was used in the episode "Burn Victim" of My Name Is Earl.  Cover versions  The Ventures covered the song on their 1969 album Underground Fire. Lizzy Mercier Descloux covered "Fire" on her album Press Color (1979)\, drastically changing the mood and style of the track. Pete Townshend\, the single's associate producer\, covered "Fire" as a member of The Who on his 1989 album The Iron Man: A Musical. Cirith Ungol covered the song on their 1991 album Paradise Lost. The Prodigy sampled the track for "Fire/Jericho"\, which was otherwise a completely different song\, on their 1992 album Experience. Emerson\, Lake & Palmer covered the song on their 1993 4-disc compilation album The Return of the Manticore. German dark electro act AmGod covered the song several times. The most well-known version is "Fire v.2" featured on the 1994 album Half Rotten and Decayed. Though it was not a true 'cover'\, Marilyn Manson's "Lunchbox" (1995) heavily samples "Fire". UK doom metal band Cathedral covered the song on their 1996 EP Hopkins (The Witchfinder General). Die Krupps covered the song on their 1997 album Paradise Now. Dutch death metal band God Dethroned covered the song on their 1997 album The Grand Grimoire. Ozzy Osbourne included a version on his 2005 album Under Cover. The song is used in one episode of Series 3 of Monkey Dust (2005) as the Paedofinder General burns the wrongly accused paedophiles with this music in the background\, complete with bastardised lyrics. US Hip hop duo Cunninlynguists sampled the song for "Hellfire" on their 2006 album A Piece of Strange. Leningrad Cowboys covered the song in a metal style and included it on their 2006 album Zombie's Paradise. Appears in the musical Disco Inferno\, when the character Duke reveals himself to be Satan in disguise.[citation needed] Death Grips\, an experimental hip hop group backed by drummer Zach Hill\, sampled "Fire" in their song "Lord of the Game".

Late at night i toss and i turn and i dream of what I need  (Chorus) I need a hero I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night He's gotta be strong And he's gotta be fast And he's gotta be fresh from the fight I need a hero I'm holding out for a hero 'til the morning light He's gotta be sure And it's gotta be soon And he's gotta be larger than life(larger than life)  Somewhere after midnight In my wildest fantasy Somewhere just beyond my reach There's someone reaching back for me Racing on the thunder and rising with the heat It's gonna take a superman to sweep me off my feet  Up where the mountains meet the heavens above Out where the lightning splits the sea I could swear that there's someone somewhere Watching me  Through the wind and the chill and the rain And the storm and the flood I can feel his approach Like the fire in my blood(like a fire in my blood x4)  hero  i need a hero I'm holding out for a hero 'til the morning light and he's gotta be sure And it's gotta be soon And he's gotta be larger than life  hero  oh I need a hero I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night He's gotta be strong And he's gotta be fast And he's gotta be fresh from the fight i need a hero COL channel name VAL atnaloj626	1
COL title VAL I Don't Care (Just As Long As You Love Me) COL performer VAL John Fogerty	COL video title VAL Gerry Mulligan - Manoir Des Mes Reves (Django's Castle) COL description VAL Gerald Joseph "Gerry" Mulligan (April 6\, 1927 – January 20\, 1996) was an American jazz saxophonist\, clarinetist\, composer and arranger.[1] Though Mulligan is primarily known as one of the leading baritone saxophonists in jazz history – playing the instrument with a light and airy tone in the era of cool jazz – he was also a notable arranger\, working with Claude Thornhill\, Miles Davis\, Stan Kenton\, and others. Mulligan's pianoless quartet of the early 1950s with trumpeter Chet Baker is still regarded as one of the more important cool jazz groups. Mulligan was also a skilled pianist and played several other reed instruments. "There are some words that have been kind of lost from modern usage that I would like to bring to my music and have striven all my life to do\, BEAUTY\, GRACE\, NOBILITY\, these are the things that music can bring to us\, as human beings. I think it is well that we who make music keep that in our consciousness." -GERRY MULLIGAN COL channel name VAL Music Legends Book	0

Man gave names to all the animals\, In the beginning\, a long time ago.  He saw an animal that liked to growl\, Big furry paws and he liked to howl. Great big furry back and furry hair\, I think I'll call it a bear.  Man gave names to all the animals\, In the beginning\, in the beginning. Man gave names to all the animals\, In the beginning\, a long time ago.  He saw an animal up on the hill\, Chewing up so much grass until she was filled. He saw milk coming out but didn't know how\, He said I think I'll call it a cow.  Man gave names to all the animals\, In the beginning\, in the beginning. Man gave names to all the animals\, In the beginning\, a long time ago.  He saw an animal that liked to snort\, Horns on his head and they weren't too short. And it looked like there was nothing he couldn't pull\, He said I think I'll call it a bull.  Man gave names to all the animals\, In the beginning\, in the beginning. Man gave names to all the animals\, In the beginning\, a long time ago.  He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail\, Real dirty face and a curly tail. He wasn't too small\, he wasn't too big\, He said I think I'll call it a pig.  Man gave names to all the animals\, In the beginning\, in the beginning. Man gave names to all the animals\, In the beginning\, a long time ago.  Next animal that he did meet\, Had wool on his back and hooves on his feet. Eating grass on a mountain side so steep\, He said I'm gonna call that one a sheep.  Man gave names to all the animals\, In the beginning\, in the beginning. Man gave names to all the animals\, In the beginning\, a long time ago.  He saw an animal as smooth as glass\, Slithering his way through the grass. He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake\, Ahhh.

COL title VAL Dark Horse COL performer VAL Scott Bradlee & Postmodern Jukebox ft. Ashley Stroud	COL video title VAL Joan of Arc (Leonard Cohen) - Allison Crowe w. lyrics COL description VAL On her debut album "secrets" Allison Crowe covers this Leonard Cohen song. Her voice and piano is accompanied by Jo Lundstrom (Rosehip Jam\, Black Velvet Band) on accordion. Crowe engineered the recording\, with production by Rainer Willeke (of Victoria\, B.C.'s Raindog Studios).  http://music.allisoncrowe.com/track/joan-of-arc  The photo of Allison Crowe is by Billie Woods.  MOJO magazine's December '08 issue paid tribute to "Rock's Greatest Poet" Leonard Cohen with a celebration of his "deep and moving music". Of Allison Crowe's contribution of "Joan of Arc" to its 'All Star Tribute"\, (featuring Judy Collins\, Nick Cave\, Katie Melua\, Martha Wainwright\, Dion and others)\, a cover-mount CD titled "Cohen Covered"\, MOJO says: "Once famously described by the Vancouver Courier as possessing a style akin to 'Elton John meets Edith Piaf'\, the Canadian singer-songwriter Allison Crowe is renowned for her ability to blend control and melodrama. Certainly she does so on this spirited cover of Cohen's 'Songs of Love and Hate' classic\, a track which also powerfully showcases her considerable talent as a fine interpreter of song."  "Any album that features a track from Leonard Cohen is certainly heading in the right direction. But when it is covered so beautifully\, it makes you realise what an amazing lyricist Leonard Cohen is. Joan of Arc is the Cohen song covered on this album and it's certainly in my top 10 of Cohen covers. It's also my favorite track on (Secrets)" ~ Colin Meeks\, indielaunchpad.com (USA)  Joan of Arc  Words & Music by Leonard Cohen As performed by Allison Crowe  Now the flames they followed Joan of Arc as she came riding through the dark; no moon to keep her armour bright\, no man to get her through this dark and smoky night.   She said\, "I'm tired of the war\, I want the kind of work I had before\, A wedding dress or something white to wear upon my swollen appetite."  Well\, I'm glad to hear you talk this way\, I've watched you riding every day and there is something in me that yearns to win such a cold\, such a lonesome heroine.  "And who are you?" she sternly spoke to the one beneath the smoke. "Why\, I'm fire\," he replied\, "And I love your solitude\, I love your pride."  "Well\, then\, fire make your body cold\, I'm going to give you mine to hold." And saying this she climbed inside to be his one\, to be his only bride.  Then deep into his fiery heart he took the dust of Joan of Arc\, and high above all these wedding guests he hung the ashes of her lovely wedding dress.  It was deep into his fiery heart he took the dust of Joan of Arc\, and then she clearly understood if he was fire\, oh\, she must be wood.  I saw her wince\, I saw her cry\, I saw the glory in her eye. Myself I long for love and light\, but must it come so cruel\,  must it be so bright? COL channel name VAL Allison Crowe	0

Along with Buck Owens\, Haggard and his band The Strangers helped create the Bakersfield sound\, which is characterized by the unique twang of Fender Telecaster and the unique mix with the traditional country steel guitar sound\, new vocal harmony styles in which the words are minimal\, and a rough edge not heard on the more polished Nashville sound recordings of the same era.  By the 1970s\, Haggard was aligned with the growing outlaw country movement\, and has continued to release successful albums through the 1990s and into the 2000s. In 1994\, he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.  In 1997\, he was inducted into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame. COL channel name VAL Marcus Brazil	0

All I hear is burn!  I didnt believe she was devils sperm. She said\, curse you all\, youll never learn! When I leave theres no return. The people laughed till she said\, burn! Warning came\, no one cared. Earth was shakin\, we stood and stared. When it came no one was spared. Still I hear burn!  You know we had no time\, We could not even try. You know we had no time.  You know we had no time\, We could not even try. You know we had no time.  The sky is red\, I dont understand\, Past midnight I still see the land.

Through these fields of destruction  Baptism of fire  I've witnessed your suffering  As the battle raged higher.  And though they did hurt me so bad  In my fear and alarm  You did not desert me  My brothers in arms.    There's so many different worlds  So many different suns  And we have just one world  But we live in different ones.    Now the sun's gone to hell  And the moon's riding high  Let me bid you farewell  Every man has to die.

COL title VAL Ho Hey COL performer VAL Hannah Trigwell	COL video title VAL Elly Lapp - Ich weiß es wird einmal ein Wunder gescheh'n COL description VAL Elly Lapp Ganz nah  Genre: Deutsch-Pop\, Chanson\, Schlager   „Eine Stimme die unter die Haut geht.  Eindringlich\, lasziv\, ganz nah."   Elly Lapp liebt die Brückenschläge. Für sie sind UFA-Schlager und Popmusik keine  unarrangierbaren Gegensätze\, sondern interpretatorische Herausforderung. Dabei ist eine sehr moderne CD entstanden\,  die gleichzeitig sehr intensiv und sehr persönlich ist. Viel näher geht`s nicht.   Es waren große Songs -- es sind große Songs. Dazu leistet eine interessante Interpretin ihren Beitrag. Elly Lapp. Die studierte Schauspielerin und Sängerin tourt mit eigenen Programmen durch Deutschland -- und sie war die Stimme des Titelsongs der erfolgreichen ARD-Fernsehserie „Kir Royal".  „Der Wind hat mir ein Lied erzählt" - gleichzeitig erste Single - und „Ich steh` im Regen" sind Versuche einer ungewöhnlichen Verbindung von UFA - HIT und POPSOUND. Zarah Leander machte einst diese Songs zu Welterfolgen. Damals hatten die Autoren wohl nie eine Umsetzung mit rockigen Gitarren oder Saxophon im Auge. Hier geben die modernen Instrumente\, wie das gesamte Pop- Arrangement\, eine ganz neue Farbe -- voller Intensität.  Doch die CD von Elly Lapp zeigt die großen Filmhits nicht nur im Popgewand\, sondern auch sehr sparsam\, kunstvoll arrangiert\, als Chansons mit großer interpretatorischer Tiefe.  z.B." Wenn ich mir was wünschen dürfte" und - vor allem - „Der Nowack lässt mich nicht verkommen" -\, ein wahrer Kultsong\, 1959 geschrieben\, sofort auf Schallplatte aufgenommen\, kurzerhand von einem Münchner Gericht verboten und wieder eingestampft -- eine echte Rarität für jedes Rundfunk- und Privatarchiv!

Join our Youtube: https://goo.gl/8AOGaN Join our Facebook: http://goo.gl/5oL723 Chester Arthur Burnett (June 10\, 1910 -- January 10\, 1976)\, known as Howlin' Wolf\, was an influential American blues singer\, guitarist and harmonica player. He was born in West Point\, Mississippi in an area now known as White Station. With a booming voice and looming physical presence\, Burnett is commonly ranked among the leading performers in electric blues; musician and critic Cub Koda declared\, "no one could match Howlin' Wolf for the singular ability to rock the house down to the foundation while simultaneously scaring its patrons out of its wits." A number of songs written or popularized by Burnett—such as "Smokestack Lightnin'"\, "Back Door Man"\, "Killing Floor" and "Spoonful"—have become blues and blues rock standards.

Jack Henderson Clement (April 5\, 1931 – August 8\, 2013) was an American singer\, songwriter\, and a record and film producer.

Era el verano claro está\, y yo empezaba a soñar con mi pasado. Ante un espejo le fingí que maquillaba mi nariz para mirarle. Cuando me vi tan cerca de él había dado no sé qué por conquistarle.  Me sonrió con intención y fue su edad la explicación de su victoria. No quiso hablarme del amor\, pues según él esa cuestión es otra historia. Me dijo tú me vas muy bien\, eres igual que la mujer de "El Graduado". Yo no pude resistir y entre sus brazos descubrí\, un sol dorado.  Dieciocho años nada más eso le hizo ser audaz mas que insolente. Cuando llegué a despertar\, solo sentí la soledad indiferente. Por un momento pretendí el retenerlo junto a mí\, pero no quise. Me dijo no has estado mal\, con un candor tan infernal\, antes de irse. Entonces tuve que fingir que maquillaba mi nariz\, para no verle y estuve a punto de olvidar que yo le doblaba la edad.

COL title VAL Midnight at the Oasis COL performer VAL Maria Muldaur	COL video title VAL That Dog - Midnight At The Oasis (Maria Muldaur cover) COL description VAL That Dog - Midnight At The Oasis.   *Audio/Slideshow*  Cover of the 1974 Maria Muldaur hit\, taken from the 1995 benefit compilation album 'Spirit of '73: Rock For Choice'.   'Spirit of '73: Rock For Choice' was put together by the activist group Feminist Majority with proceeds going to support the Becky Bell/Rosie Jimenez Campaign "to lift consent laws and federal funding restrictions that are forcing young women to turn to back-alley abortions". The compilation's title is inspired by the January 22\, 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion in the United States. The songs included are all contemporary artists of 1995 covering songs that were popular in the early 1970s.   Fun Fact: The producer of the original "Midnight At The Oasis" by Maria Muldaur was none other than That Dog singer/guitarist Anna Waronker's father\, Lenny Waronker.

Today the mysterious Taggy Matcher and Stix Records are proud to present his first album. After a first single covering two tracks of The Black Keys (2013)\, Taggy recently presented the song “My Man”\, alongside the young talented LMK. On this track\, he digs more into the Digital sound from the early 80s\, showing another side of his production scale.   Coming out late November\, this album called "Singasong" definitely explores even more into the various styles of Jamaican music.  http://www.favoriterec.com/2014/10/taggy-matcher-singasong-lp COL channel name VAL Favorite Recordings	0

COL title VAL Tramp COL performer VAL Brian Auger\, Julie Driscoll and The Trinity	COL video title VAL "Warren Smith ~ Rock 'n' Roll Ruby" - Sun 239 1956 COL description VAL Warren Smith - Rock n Roll Ruby on Sun 239. Hope You ENJOY!!! Warren Smith (February 7\, 1932 -- January 30\, 1980) was an American rockabilly and country music singer and guitarist. Smith was born in Humphreys County\, Mississippi to Iola and Willie Warren Smith\, who divorced when he was young. He was raised by his maternal grandparents in Louise\, Mississippi where they had a small farm and dry goods store. Smith took up the guitar to while away his evenings while in the United States Air Force stationed in San Antonio\, Texas. By the time of his discharge from the service\, he had decided to make a career of music. He moved to West Memphis\, Arkansas and auditioned\, successfully\, to play the Cotton Club\, a local hot spot. Steel guitarist Stan Kessler\, who was playing at that nightclub with the Snearly Ranch Boys\, immediately spotted Smith's potential and took him to Sun Records to audition for Sam Phillips\, with the Snearly Ranch Boys providing backup. Phillips liked what he heard\, and decided that "Rock & Roll Ruby"\, a song credited to Johnny Cash\, would be Smith's first record. (Smith later claimed that "Rock & Roll Ruby" was actually written by George Jones and sold to Cash for $40.) Smith recorded it on February 5\, 1956. Phillips\, who was hedging his bets over whether rock and roll would maintain its popularity\, released that record with a country crooner\, aptly named "I'd Rather Be Safe Than Sorry"\, on the flip side. By May 26\, "Rock & Roll Ruby" had hit No. 1 on the local pop charts. Smith's first record for Sun went on to outsell the first Sun releases by Elvis Presley\, Johnny Cash and Carl Perkins. In August 1956\, Smith went back to the Sun Records studio to record his second release\, "Ubangi Stomp". This infectious rocker had an incorrect lyric including an African chief with the syntax of a movie Indian. For the B side\, Smith recorded the classic ballad "Black Jack David". This song\, which originated in early 18th-century Britain and survived in various forms in the mountains of the American south\, may be the oldest song ever recorded by a rock and roll performer. Although a resounding artistic success\, it did not sell as well as Smith's debut. In 1957\, Smith recorded "So Long\, I'm Gone"\, a song written by Roy Orbison\, and it did become Smith's biggest hit at Sun\, peaking at No. 74 nationally (Billboard). But Sun had no cash to promote it at the same time as Sam Phillips put every dollar Sun had behind Jerry Lee Lewis' "Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin On". Although Smith continued to make rockabilly records for Sun\, including a cover version of Slim Harpo's "Got Love If Your Want It" (recorded in October 1957)\, these records did not do well commercially. Toward the end of 1958\, Smith\, seeing his future in country music\, cut a final record for Sun\, a cover version of Don Gibson's "Sweet Sweet Girl". In spite of a review in Billboard calling it "ultra commercial"\, this record also failed to sell. Like other artists such as Sonny Burgess\, Hayden Thompson\, Billy Lee Riley and Ray Harris\, chart success largely eluded him. Smith then decided to leave Sun Records.

COL title VAL Goodbye Blue Sky COL performer VAL Ann Wilson with Nancy Wilson	COL video title VAL Average White Band ~ If I Ever Lose This Heaven "1975" Funk COL description VAL Their self-effacing name to the contrary\, Average White Band was anything but -- one of the few white groups to cross the color line and achieve success and credibility playing funk\, with their tight\, fiery sound also belying their Scottish heritage\, evoking American R&B hotbeds like Detroit\, Memphis\, and Philadelphia instead. Singer/bassist Alan Gorrie\, guitarists Hamish Stuart and Onnie McIntyre\, tenor saxophonist Malcolm Duncan\, keyboardist/saxophonist Roger Ball\, and drummer Robbie McIntosh comprised the original Average White Band lineup. Veterans of numerous Scottish soul and jazz groups\, they made their debut in 1973 as the opening act at Eric Clapton's Rainbow Theatre comeback gig\, soon issuing their debut LP\, Show Your Hand\, to little notice. After adopting the abbreviated moniker AWB\, a year later the band issued their self-titled sophomore effort\, topping the American pop charts with the Arif Mardin-produced instrumental "Pick Up the Pieces." The record's mammoth success was nevertheless tempered by the September 23\, 1974 death of McIntosh\, who died at a Hollywood party after overdosing on heroin.  Cut the Cake Ex-Bloodstone drummer Steve Ferrone replaced McIntosh for AWB's third album\, 1975's Cut the Cake\, which scored a Top Ten hit with its title track as well as two other chart entries\, "If I Ever Lose This Heaven" and "School Boy Crush." (Put It Where You Want It\, issued later that same year\, was simply a retitled and repackaged Show Your Hand.) With 1976's Soul Searching\, the group reclaimed the full Average White Band name\, scoring their final Top 40 hit with "Queen of My Soul." Following the live Person to Person\, they issued Benny & Us\, a collaboration with soul legend Ben E. King. However\, after subsequent outings\, including 1978's Warmer Communications\, 1979's Feel No Fret\, and 1980's Shine\, failed to recapture the energy of AWB's peak\, the group dissolved in 1982\, with Ferrone later joining Duran Duran and Stuart recording with Paul McCartney. Gorrie\, Ball\, and McIntyre reformed Average White Band in 1989\, tapping vocalist Alex Ligertwood for their comeback effort Aftershock. Oft-sampled by hip-hop producers throughout the 1990s\, the group continued touring prior to releasing Soul Tattoo in 1996. The live album\, Face to Face\, followed three years later.

COL title VAL New York Groove COL performer VAL The Sweet	COL video title VAL Les Terribles - Ce n'est pas une vie COL description VAL Ready for an amazing 60's dance party? Well\, don't forget to bring this platter to the DJ! This band from Paris\, France plays an incredible mix of 60's garage-punk & GoGo Beat and now finally returns with their second longplayer 'Ils sont formidables!'. The band that includes members of THE NO TALENTS\, LES SYNAPSES\, DUTRONC\, CECILIA UND DIE SAUERKRAUTS & OPERATION S goes back to the sound of the French Beat & Roll when it was bitten by the Big Bad British Bug back in 1965. Imagine how THEM\, THE SMALL FACES\, THE YARDBIRDS or the early STONES would've sound if they were from France\, never turned professionals and Van Morrison\, Keith Relf or Mike Jagger were chicks. All the songs are in French\, with that glamorous 'mademoiselle' accent! The band could've been described best as the great french sixties rock band that should have existed but never did. Owing to cultural impediments and lame business practices\, there were very few outstanding french rockers from that period. Ronnie Bird\, Larry Greco\, and a dozen others you've never heard of: LES TERRIBLES cover them all\, and every song makes you wanna dance. The band rounds out their set with some originals\, as well as their own french versions of some great foreign songs that never got adapted before\, all done with a perfect ear for the style. Fronted by the charming and talented chanteuse Rudie this hard-working orchestre delivers the groove that gets the dance floor moving to the Swim\, the Jerk\, and the Hully-Gully. Les Terribles are sur scene ! ((Jon Dragueur) A Top 10 forever-must have this one is. What more can we tell you? COL channel name VAL Matthew East	0

COL title VAL What's Forever For COL performer VAL England Dan & John Ford Coley	COL video title VAL Henry Mancini -   Tiny Bubbles COL description VAL "I think there is a song out there to describe just about any situation."― Criss Jami ▼▼▼  HENRY MANCINI Enrico Nicola "Henry" Mancini was an American composer\, arranger and conductor\, who is best remembered for his film and television scores.  He won a record number of Grammy Awards\, plus a posthumous Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995. His best-known works include the jazz-idiom theme to The Pink Panther film series ("The Pink Panther Theme") and the theme to the Peter Gunn television series.  Mancini had a long collaboration with the film director Blake Edwards and won numerous Academy Awards for the songs in Edwards films\, including "Moon River" from Breakfast at Tiffany's\, "Days of Wine and Roses" and for the score to "Victor Victoria". Entering 1946\, Mancini became a pianist and arranger for the newly re-formed Glenn Miller Orchestra\, led by 'Everyman' Tex Beneke. After World War II\, Mancini broadened his skills in composition\, counterpoint\, harmony and orchestration during studies opening with the composers Ernst Krenek and Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco.  In 1952\, Mancini joined the Universal Pictures music department. During the next six years\, he contributed music to over 100 movies\, most notably The Creature from the Black Lagoon\, It Came from Outer Space\, Tarantula\, This Island Earth\, The Glenn Miller Story (for which he received his first Academy Award nomination)\, The Benny Goodman Story and Orson Welles' Touch of Evil. During this time\, he also wrote some popular songs. His first hit was a single by Guy Lombardo and His Royal Canadians titled I Won't Let You Out of My Heart. Mancini left Universal to work as an independent composer/arranger in 1958. Soon after\, he scored the television series Peter Gunn for writer/producer Blake Edwards. This was the genesis of a relationship in which Edwards and Mancini collaborated on 30 films over 35 years.  Along with Alex North\, Elmer Bernstein\, Leith Stevens and Johnny Mandel\, Henry Mancini was a pioneer of the inclusion of jazz elements in the late romantic orchestral film and TV scoring prevalent at the time. Mancini scored many TV movies\, including The Thorn Birds and The Shadow Box. He wrote many television themes\, including Mr. Lucky (starring John Vivyan and Ross Martin)\, NBC Mystery Movie\, What's Happening\, Tic Tac Dough (1990 version) and Once Is Not Enough. In the 1984--85 television season\, four series featured original Mancini themes: Newhart\, Hotel\, Remington Steele\, and Ripley's Believe It or Not. Mancini also composed the "Viewer Mail" theme for Late Night with David Letterman. Mancini composed the theme for NBC Nightly News used beginning in 1975\, and a different theme by him\, titled Salute to the President was used by NBC News for its election coverage (including primaries and conventions) from 1976 to 1992. Salute to the President was only published in a school-band arrangement\, although Mancini performed it frequently with symphony orchestras on his concert tours. Songs with music by Mancini were staples of the easy listening genre from the 1960s to the 1980s. Some of the artists who have recorded Mancini songs include Andy Williams\, Paul Anka\, Pat Boone\, Anita Bryant\, Jack Jones\, Frank Sinatra\, Perry Como\, Connie Francis\, Eydie Gorme\, Steve Lawrence\, Trini Lopez\, George Maharis\, Johnny Mathis\, Jerry Vale and Ray Conniff\, to name just a few.... Mancini recorded over 90 albums\, in styles ranging from big band to light classical to pop. Eight of these albums were certified gold by The Recording Industry Association of America. He had a 20-year contract with RCA Records\, resulting in 60 commercial record albums that made him a household name among artists of easy-listening music.  TINY BUBBLES "Tiny Bubbles" is a song written by Martin Denny and Leon Pober. It was released in 1966 by Don Ho.  It is widely considered to be Denny's most famous song.  MHO "Tiny Bubbles" is -\, with all due respect for Mr Denny\, a rather "simple" song but... hand the notes to a top arranger like Henry Mancini and .... what you get is a fabulous orchestral arrangement that\, in a way\, transforms the song into an easy floating ballad.  A particularly rich instrumentation with strings\, brass\, and all the other "standard" instruments of a large orchestra\, completed with the sound of the ukelele and harp\, so typical for the Hawaiian style music.  The Mancini chorus adds some warmth and "body" to the recording\, so\, in the end\, we get to hear a splendid version of this well known theme.   Have a great (musical) trip to "Aloha country" :) !  Enjoy. COL channel name VAL Socratess2007	0

Through these fields of destruction  Baptism of fire  I've witnessed your suffering  As the battle raged higher.  And though they did hurt me so bad  In my fear and alarm  You did not desert me  My brothers in arms.    There's so many different worlds  So many different suns  And we have just one world  But we live in different ones.    Now the sun's gone to hell  And the moon's riding high  Let me bid you farewell  Every man has to die.  But it's written in the starlight  And every line in your palm  We're fools to make war  On our brothers in arms... COL channel name VAL UFCHeadhunter	0

This was the first single released from Double Fantasy\, and the first new recording Lennon had released since 1975. It was chosen by Lennon not because he felt it was the best track on the album\, but because it was the most appropriate following his five year absence from the recording industry. He referred to it during production as the "Elvis/Orbison" track\, as he "tongue in cheek" impersonated their vocal styles. The uplifting bell at the intro of the song serves as the antidote to the morose bell sound which opens Lennon's first solo album\, Lennon seeing it as his having come full circle.

By the 1970s\, Haggard was aligned with the growing outlaw country movement\, and has continued to release successful albums through the 1990s and into the 2000s.

They later teamed in the late 80's to write a successful AIDS musical called "Elegies for Angels\, Punks and Raging Queens." It was good enough that there have been three cast recordings of it released.

COL title VAL Love Hangover COL performer VAL Yazz	COL video title VAL The Clevers - A Swingin Safari COL description VAL Idos de 1962. Cinco rapazes\, se unem para ensaiar música\, e formam um "conjunto musical"\, como se dizia na época\, o qual torna-se gradativamente conhecido como THE CLEVERS. Estilo largamente baseado no que fazia então os conjuntos norte-americanos THE SHADOWS ou THE VENTURES. Música instrumental com bateria\, guitarra base\, contra baixo\, guitarra solo\, órgão elétrico e saxofone.  Mas os nossos incríveis futuros músicos de sucesso também cantavam\, cabendo ao vocalista Mingo\, a responsabilidade de se tornar um cantor de verdade.   Um radialista (DJ)\, chamado Antonio Aguillar\, com o programa RITMOS DA JUVENTUDE na Rádio Nacional de São Paulo\, responsável pelo descobrimento de vários conjuntos\, resolve ser o mentor dos The Clevers\, apresentando-os à gravadora Continental. Palmeira\, diretor artístico da Continental não teve dúvida em contratar os The Clevers para o seu "cast"\, e junto com Alfredo Corleto do Departamento de Divulgação da gravadora\, marcaram um encontro com Antonio Aguillar\, no programa Enzo de Almeida Pasos\, e ali foi assinado o contrato\, perante os telespectadores.  Logo\, gravaram um 78 rpm e em seguida um LP (ENCONTRO COM THE CLEVERS- TWIST).  Já fazendo muito sucesso\, resolveu empreender uma excursão mundial\, no auge da Beatlemania. Não se tem muitas referências sobre esta viagem\, mas é famosa a história do caso (real ou fictício\, quem sabe?) entre o baterista Netinho com a cantora italiana de grande sucesso na época Rita Pavone.  Antes de iniciarem nova excursão de 40 dias para a Argentina\, rompem com o empresário Antonio Aguillar (o descobridor do grupo)\, que detinha os direitos do nome THE CLEVERS. Os membros dos Incríveis tentam comprar a marca\, mas não chegam a um acordo.  Na volta ao Brasil\, descobrem que tem um outro grupo brasileiro gravando discos com o nome de The Clevers. Disputas do nome do grupo à parte\, eles resolvem adotar o apelido brasileiro OS INCRÍVEIS\, tornando-se então o nome oficial do grupo.  Lançam grandes sucessos cantando em vários idiomas como o italiano\, espanhol e inglês. Chegam a filmar um longa metragem\, no estilo dos Beatles\, chamado OS INCRÍVEIS NESTE MUNDO LOUCO\, lançando o LP com o mesmo nome.  Atingindo o auge do sucesso no Brasil\, gravam o LP OS INCRÍVEIS INTERNACIONAIS\, com canções em português\, inglês e japonês.  Corria o ano de 1968 e 1969\, OS INCRÍVEIS estavam no auge do sucesso\, realizando shows ao vivo no Brasil todo\, e com suas músicas tocando em todas as rádios. É dessa época os mega sucessos ERA UM GAROTO QUE COMO EU AMAVA OS BEATLES E OS ROLLING STONES\, O MILIONÁRIO (2a. versão)\, CZARDAS\, ISRAEL\, TE AMO\, MUNDO LOUCO\, MENINA\, KOKORONO-NIJI\, e outros mais.

COL title VAL Don't Mess Up a Good Thing COL performer VAL Ry Cooder	COL video title VAL You're Just In Love - Perry Como COL description VAL "You're Just in Love" is a popular song by Irving Berlin. It was published in 1950 and was first performed by Ethel Merman and Russell Nype in Call Me Madam\, a musical comedy that debuted at the Imperial Theatre in New York City on October 12 that year. The show ran for 644 performances. Ethel Merman also later starred in the 1953 film version. Theatre lore has it that Berlin wrote the song one night after Call Me Madam was not doing well in tryouts. The second act of the show was lacking. "What I'd like to do is a song with the kid (Russell Nype)\," Merman said. So\, Berlin went to his room and later produced the counterpoint song. When Berlin played the song for Merman\, she said "We'll never get off the stage." According to Berlin's biographer though\, Berlin played the song for Russell Nype first\, but admonished him not to admit he did so because it would infuriate Merman.  Several recorded versions made the charts in 1950-51: by Perry Como and The Fontane Sisters\, by Rosemary Clooney and Guy Mitchell\, and by Ethel Merman and Dick Haymes.  The Perry Como/Fontane Sisters version was recorded on September 26\, 1950 and released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number 20-3945. The record first reached the Billboard magazine charts on December 22\, 1950 and lasted 17 weeks on the chart\, peaking at #5.  The Rosemary Clooney/Guy Mitchell version was recorded on October 21\, 1950 and released by Columbia Records as catalog number 39052. The record first reached the Billboard magazine charts on February 23\, 1951 and lasted 2 weeks on the chart\, peaking at #29.  The Ethel Merman/Dick Haymes version was recorded on October 17\, 1950 and released by Decca Records as catalog number 27317. The record first reached the Billboard magazine charts on March 30\, 1951 and lasted 1 week on the chart\, at #30. Although the lowest charting of the three\, it got a considerable amount of airplay in subsequent years.  Musically\, the song is one of Irving Berlin's three well-known songs that use true counterpoint—a main melody with a secondary melody running at the same time\, both with independent lyrics - his two other best-known counterpoint songs are Play a Simple Melody and "An Old-Fashioned Wedding" (see the 1966 revival of "Annie Get Your Gun").

Joanie\, who scored a #7 US hit with “Johnny Get Angry” in the summer of 1962\, didn’t return to Hot-100 after “When The Boys Get Together” charted in October of the same year.  Some great records followed on Warners\, however\, including the northern soul favorite\, “Don’t Pity Me” in 1965. By 1967\, Joanie was with Columbia and following year with Capitol but still the hits continued to elude her – notwithstanding the quality of her recordings.  “Step Inside Love” had been a #8 UK hit for Cilla Black during Cilla’s ten year chart run from the early 60s.  The Happy Tiger label was owned by the Flying Tiger Line\, an air freight company. The label ran from 1968-71 and was home to artists such as Donnie Brooks\, Priscilla Paris and Them.

COL title VAL It Ain't Easy COL performer VAL Long John Baldry	COL video title VAL Walker Brothers :::: Pretty Girls Everywhere. COL description VAL The Walker Brothers were an American pop group of the 1960s and 1970s\, comprising Scott Engel (eventually known professionally as Scott Walker)\, John Walker (born John Maus\, but using the name Walker since his teens)\, and Gary Leeds (eventually known as Gary Walker). After moving to Britain in 1965\, they had a number of top ten albums and singles there\, including the No. 1 chart hits "Make It Easy on Yourself" and "The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine (Anymore)\," both of which also made the US top 20.  Formed in 1964\, they adopted the 'Walker Brothers' name even though the members are all unrelated as a show business touch—"simply because we liked it." They provided a unique counterpoint to the British Invasion in that they were a group from the United States that achieved much more success in the United Kingdom than in their home country\, during the period when the popularity of British bands such as The Beatles dominated the US.

COL title VAL Shackles and Chains COL performer VAL Riley Crabtree	COL video title VAL Cliff Richard - We Don't Talk Anymore (1979) COL description VAL Britain's answer to Elvis Presley\, Richard (born Harry Webb) dominated the pre-Beatles British pop scene in the late '50s and early '60s. An accomplished singer with a genuine feel for the music\, Richard's artistic legacy is nonetheless meager\, as he was quickly steered toward a middle-of-the-road pop direction. Several of his late-'50s recordings\, however\, were genuinely exciting Presley-esque rockers -- especially his first hit\, "Move It" (1958) -- and gave British teenagers their first taste of genuine homegrown rock & roll talent. Backed by the Shadows -- clean-cut instrumental virtuosos who became legends of their own -- Richard embarked on a truly awesome string of hit singles in Britain\, scoring no less than 43 Top 20 hits between 1958 and 1969. One of these\, although it was by no means one of the more successful\, was an actual Mick Jagger/Keith Richards composition (the ballad "Blue Turns to Grey").  In his homeland\, Richard's popularity was diminished only slightly by the rise of the Beatles\, but in his prime\, he had a much rougher time in the U.S.\, hitting the Top 40 only three times (with "Living Doll" in 1959\, "It's All in the Game" in 1963\, and "Devil Woman" in 1976). Richard belatedly cracked the U.S. Top Ten in 1976 with "Devil Woman\," and racked up a few other hits ("We Don't Talk Anymore\," "Dreaming\," "A Little in Love") in a mainstream pop/rock style. He remains an institution in Britain\, where he is one of the nation's most popular all-around entertainers of all time. ~ Richie Unterberger\, All Music Guide _____________________________________ In 2008\, Richard's 50th year in music\, will see the release of the 8CD box set\, And They Said It Wouldn't Last (My 50 Years In Music). In September\, a single celebrating his 50 years in pop music\, titled * Thank you for a Lifetime has been released. On the 14th of September 2008 Thank You For A Lifetime reached No.3 on the UK music charts\, which gives Cliff a Top 3 hit in each of his six decades as a singer. On 2nd November 2008\, British newspaper The Mail on Sunday gave away a free promotional CD entitled '50th Anniversary' containing 12 tracks picked by Sir Cliff himself.

COL title VAL Long Tall Texan COL performer VAL Jerry Woodard	COL video title VAL A Love Supreme\, Part 1: Acknowledgement - John Coltrane (1965) COL description VAL "Part 1: Acknowledgement" was the first track on "A Love Supreme"\, a jazz studio album recorded by John Coltrane's classic quartet in December 1964 and released by Impulse! Records in February 1965.  It is generally considered to be among Coltrane's greatest works\, as it melded the hard bop sensibilities of his early career with the free jazz style he adopted later.  The quartet recorded the album in one session on December 9\, 1964\, at the Van Gelder Studio in Englewood Cliffs\, New Jersey.  The album is a four-part suite\, broken up into tracks: "Acknowledgement" (which contains the mantra that gave the suite its name)\, "Resolution"\, "Pursuance"\, and "Psalm".  It is intended to be a spiritual album\, broadly representative of a personal struggle for purity\, and expresses Coltrane's deep gratitude as he admits to his talent and instrument as being owned not by him but by a spiritual higher power.  The track begins the album with the bang of a gong\, or tam-tam\, followed by cymbal washes.  Jimmy Garrison follows on bass with the four-note motif which structures the entire movement\, after which Coltrane's solo follows.  Besides soloing upon variations of the motif\, at one point Coltrane repeats the four notes over and over in different modulations.  After many repetitions\, the motif becomes the vocal chant "A Love Supreme"\, sung by Coltrane\, accompanying himself via overdubs.  "A Love Supreme" is often listed amongst the greatest jazz albums of all time.  It was also quite popular for a jazz album\, selling about 500\,000 copies by 1970\, a number far exceeding Coltrane's typical Impulse! sales of around 30\,000.  As further testimony to the recording's historic significance\, the manuscript for the album is one of the National Museum of American History's 'Treasures of American History'\, part of the collection of the Smithsonian Institution.  The Penguin Guide to Jazz selected this album as part of its suggested 'Core Collection'\, stating "It is without precedent and parallel\, and though it must also be one of the best-loved jazz records of all time it somehow remains remote from critical pigeonholing" calling it "immensely concentrated and rich."  The album's influence has been extensive and diverse.  Musicians ranging from tenor Joshua Redman to the singer Bono of U2 have singled out the influence of the album on their own work.  Guitarists John McLaughlin and Carlos Santana have each credited the album as one of their greatest early influences.  John William Coltrane\, sometimes abbreviated 'Trane' (September 23\, 1926 -- July 17\, 1967)\, was an American jazz saxophonist and composer. He was beatified by the African Orthodox Church as Saint John William Coltrane.  Working in the bebop and hard bop idioms early in his career\, Coltrane helped pioneer the use of modes in jazz and later was at the forefront of free jazz.  He was prolific\, organizing at least fifty recording sessions as a leader during his recording career\, and appeared as a sideman on many other albums\, notably with trumpeter Miles Davis and pianist Thelonious Monk.  As his career progressed\, his music took on an increasingly spiritual dimension.  He influenced innumerable musicians\, and remains one of the most significant tenor saxophonists in jazz history.  Coltrane died from liver cancer at Huntington Hospital on Long Island on July 17\, 1967\, at the age of 40.  This channel is dedicated to the classic jazz music you've loved for years.

Buy your SIGNED copy here: http://stix-shop.dk/ More info: http://www.pasborg.dk/  ''Stefan Pasborg is yet another Nordic artist gradually raising his profile across international borders as he leads his new five-piece outfit around Europe.... Most pieces exploited the players' individual virtuosity\, but in principle the writing for the group emphasized collectivity rather than individuality\, always knitted tightly by Pasborg's strong drumming.... Odessa 5 is certainly a band to be blown away by''  - All About Jazz\, USA.   Stefan Pasborg's band Odessa ''X-tra Large'' features some of the finest musicians on the Nordic jazz scenes. Musicians that aren't afraid to cross new musical land. Together they play some seriously exiting multi-jazz. The bodily and the imagination is the main focus\, and you have to travel all the way back in time to Charles Mingus to find the same kind of energy. There is not so much more to say other than when the musicians are having fun\, as they so obviously have in this case\, then the listener has as well. COL channel name VAL copentube	0

COL title VAL On the Sentimental Side COL performer VAL Bing Crosby	COL video title VAL Bob Thompson - June is bustin' out all over COL description VAL Bob Thompson (b. 1924\, San Jose\, California) was a composer\, arranger\, and orchestra leader from the 1950s through the 1980s. Active in Los Angeles\, Thompson was a recording artist for RCA Victor\, scored film and television soundtracks\, and wrote commercial jingles. Thompson is considered a prime exponent of what has belatedly been termed "Space age pop\," or "Space Age Bachelor Pad Music." This style of breezy\, experimental orchestral music became popular in the 1950s and 1960s following the introduction of the long-playing microgroove record and the advent of high-fidelity and stereo home audio systems\, which allowed enhanced sonic reproduction.

Era el verano claro está\, y yo empezaba a soñar con mi pasado. Ante un espejo le fingí que maquillaba mi nariz para mirarle. Cuando me vi tan cerca de él había dado no sé qué por conquistarle.  Me sonrió con intención y fue su edad la explicación de su victoria. No quiso hablarme del amor\, pues según él esa cuestión es otra historia. Me dijo tú me vas muy bien\, eres igual que la mujer de "El Graduado". Yo no pude resistir y entre sus brazos descubrí\, un sol dorado.  Dieciocho años nada más eso le hizo ser audaz mas que insolente. Cuando llegué a despertar\, solo sentí la soledad indiferente. Por un momento pretendí el retenerlo junto a mí\, pero no quise. Me dijo no has estado mal\, con un candor tan infernal\, antes de irse. Entonces tuve que fingir que maquillaba mi nariz\, para no verle y estuve a punto de olvidar que yo le doblaba la edad.

In June 1987 Gerald Arthur Friend picked up a 14-year-old female friend after leaving a concert at the Tacoma Dome. Upon trying to exit the car the girl was handcuffed and held hostage at knife point. The girl was taken to a mobile home where she was tortured and raped with various objects for two days. She was also threatened with a blowtorch."  we recorded our cover of "polly" for SPIN magazine's "Newermind" tribute/compilation to mark the 20th anniversary of "Nevermind" in september. michael (who a lot of you have seen as the new drummer of my touring band\, the grand theft orchestra) produced/engineered and played bass on the recording.  this is a video me (glockenspiel\, vocals\, Taurus bass pedal)\, chad raines (banjo\, percussion)\, and michael (bass\, percussion) shot in new haven\, CT on a super-tight budget with the help of some actors and filmmakers from around new york and yale.   we filmed it in one day in november...i wrote the script and michael directed the video. blake\, who plays the angel\, is also on the cover of the first dolls' album "a is for accident"...looking very different in a long red dress.  so many people loaned us stuff and worked for free on this video to keep us under budget - THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH.  x afp ________________  FULL CREDITS & THANK YOUS...  song by NIRVANA  starring CHRISTOPHER M.

COL title VAL Contigo en la distancia COL performer VAL Luis Miguel	COL video title VAL ELLIE POP - WHATCHA GONNA DO ABOUT IT.wmv COL description VAL ELLIE POP - 'Watcha Gonna Do 'Bout It' (Mainstream S-6115) 1968  Before I started collecting original 60s garage/psych 45s I spent decades buying (mostly) original and re-issue albums and one of my early purchases was this obscurity by Ellie Pop on Mainstream Records. This album is hard to find and commands a decent price tag but it was re-issued a few years ago and should now be available to a larger audience at last.  In my opinion Ellie Pop were treading their own path in 1968\, there's no fuzz\, no psych touches\, no 1968isms of heavy guitars and keyboards. What you get is a collection of beautifully constructed pop songs that suggest a big Anglophile influence\, in particular mid-60s period Beatles. They sound similar to say The Merry-Go-Round or The Left Banke but without the baroque touches. Just pure pop\, or should I say Ellie Pop.  Virtually every review I've read online or in Shindig for instance\, fails to mention that 'Whatcha Gonna Do 'Bout It' is a cover of a Hollies cut they recorded in 1963 for their debut album 'Stay With The Hollies.' Ellie Pop wrote all of their own tunes except this one!  I'm not certain where Ellie Pop hailed from or even the full names of the group members but it has been suggested elsewhere that they were from Detroit. Maybe someone can confirm this?  http://expo67-cavestones.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/ellie-pop-whatcha-gonna-do-bout-it.html COL channel name VAL ACID REVOLVER	0

And what am I supposed to say when I'm all choked up and you're OK? I'm falling to pieces\, yeah\, I'm falling to pieces  They say bad things happen for a reason But no wise words gonna stop the bleeding 'Cause she's moved on while I'm still grieving And when a heart breaks no it don't break even\, even... no  What am I gonna do when the best part of me was always you? And what am I supposed to say when I'm all choked up and you're OK?

COL title VAL Nine Below Zero COL performer VAL The Nighthawks	COL video title VAL Nine Below Zero - Sonny Boy Williamson (Trumpet) COL description VAL Recorded on December 4\, 1951. Williamson's first recording session took place in 1951 for Lillian McMurry of Jackson\, Mississippi's Trumpet Records\, three years after the death of John Lee Williamson\, which for the first time allowed some legitimacy to Miller's carefully worded claim to being "the one and only Sonny Boy Williamson". McMurry later erected Williamson's headstone\, near Tutwiler\, Mississippi\, in 1977. Checker Records When Trumpet went bankrupt in 1955\, Sonny Boy's recording contract was yielded to its creditors\, who sold it to Chess Records in Chicago\, Illinois. Sonny Boy had begun developing a following in Chicago beginning in 1953\, when he appeared there as a member of Elmore James's band. It was during his Chess years that he enjoyed his greatest success and acclaim\, recording about 70 songs for Chess subsidiary Checker Records from 1955 to 1964. Sonny Boy's first LP record was titled Down and Out Blues and was released by Checker Records in 1959. Ace Records One single\, "Boppin' With Sonny" b/w "No Nights By Myself" was released with Ace Records in 1955.

COL title VAL Burning of the Midnight Lamp COL performer VAL Eric Clapton	COL video title VAL BERT HEERINK STORM NA DE STILTE Rocksterren COL description VAL I DO NOT OWN THIS VIDEO. © (c)Copyright belongs to the rightful owner  Bert Heerink (Utrecht\, 26 januari 1953) is een Nederlandse muzikant. Heerink werd voornamelijk bekend als zanger van de Nederlandse hardrockband Vandenberg\, die ook internationaal succes had.Met Vandenberg had Heerink in de jaren 80 twee wereldhits: Burning Heart en Different Worlds. Nadat Vandenberg de samenwerking met Heerink beëindigde trad Bert toe tot de heavy metal band Picture en nam een aantal Nederlandstalige albums op. Bekend werd hij verder door in 1995 voor een aantal reclames voor Heineken Nederlandstalige teksten te zingen op melodieën van oude rocknummers. De nummers Zon in de Winter\, Doe wat je wil en Julie July werden hits. Voor het album Storm na de Stilte kreeg hij een gouden plaat.Bij de reünie van Kayak  in 2000 werd Heerink zanger van deze band en bleef dit tot 2006. In 2002 toert Bert met het orkest van de Koninklijke Luchtmacht door Nederland in de hoofdrol van "Tommy".Met Peter Groot Kormelink en Erik Mesie vormt Heerink het muzikale feestprogramma "De Heeren van Oranje" waarin alle grote hits van de 3 Heeren voorbij komen.Bert neemt in 2005/2006 ook vocalen voor zijn rekening tijdens de succesvolle tour van het orkest van Koninklijke Luchtmacht door de Nederlandse theaters: Queen in concert\, waarbij diverse Queen klassiekers worden vertolkt. Sommige nummers worden ook in een nieuw jasje gestoken\, zoals 'Crazy little thing called love'\, welke een big band sausje krijgt.In 2006 heeft Bert Heerink samen met zijn zus Saskia onder de naam Heerink een album uitgebracht met de naam Purify. Het album wordt gekenmerkt door een persoonlijke inslag.In 2007 en ook in 2008 maakte Heerink met het Noord Nederlands Orkest (NNO) onder leiding van de Belgische dirigent Dirk Brossé met het cross-overprogramma Symphonic echoes of Pink Floyd een tournee\, waarin de grote hits van de Engelse rockformatie centraal staan. Naast Heerink nemen Antonie Kamerling en Erik Mesie de zangpartijen voor hun rekening\, bijgestaan door onder meer gitarist Joost Vergoossen.Het wordt het tot dan toe best bezochte concertjaar met ruim 98.000 bezoekers. In 2008 vervangt Chris Zeegers Antonie Kamerling bij deze productie.Tegenwoordig (2006) woont Heerink in Hoogeveen. Recentelijk bracht Heerink de single "When I close my eyes"\, uit. De single is uitsluitend via de website www.bertheerink.nl te downloaden en de opbrengst gaat naar de stichting KidsRights die zich wereldwijd inzet voor de rechten van kinderen. Op 6 december 2008 ontving Bert Heerink het Lidmaatschap in de Orde van Oranje Nassau als waardering voor zijn inzet en prestaties in de popmuziek en zijn inzet voor de kinderrechtenorganisatie KidsRights. Eerder ontving Bert Heerink in Hoogeveen om dezelfde reden een eigen ster in de "Walk of Veen".In april 2009 brengt Heerink samen met collega's Erik Mesie en Peter Groot Kormelink onder de naam "Heeren van Oranje" hun eerste eigen single uit; "Made in Holland" waarmee ze landelijk debuteerden op het Tros Muziekfeest in Middelburg. In samenwerking met OAR Heaven Records werkt Bert vanaf mei 2009 in Duitsland in de studio van Michael Voss aan een volledig eigen Engelstalig rockalbum. De uitnodiging een dergelijk album te maken kwam na het meewerken aan het tweede "Voices of Rock" album waar Bert met "Shame on you" op vertegenwoordigd is. Het album komt op 25 september wereldwijd uit en bevat nummers van grote songwriters als Jeff Silbard (Wind beneath my Wings) en Russ Ballard.In februari 2010 komt de eerste single van dit album "Panic Attack" binnen in de single top 100 waarna deze doorstijgt en hoog in de charts komt. Een tweede stuk "All fired Up" wordt tegelijkertijd door het TT Circuit Assen gekozen tot de seizoenstune. Op 3 april trad Heerink tijdens de 5e uitreiking van de Eddie Christiani Award\, die hijzelf opnieuw presenteerde\,op met Steve Lukather\, (gitarist/zanger van Toto) de winnaar van deze editie.

Active in Los Angeles\, Thompson was a recording artist for RCA Victor\, scored film and television soundtracks\, and wrote commercial jingles. Thompson is considered a prime exponent of what has belatedly been termed "Space age pop\," or "Space Age Bachelor Pad Music." This style of breezy\, experimental orchestral music became popular in the 1950s and 1960s following the introduction of the long-playing microgroove record and the advent of high-fidelity and stereo home audio systems\, which allowed enhanced sonic reproduction.

On this freewheeling and jubilant 13-track tribute\, MTO is propelled by a dynamic cast of special guests\, including Antony Hegarty\, Bernie Worrell\, Bill Laswell\, Dean Bowman\, Martha Wainwright\, Sandra St. Victor\, Shilpa Ray and Vernon Reid\, treating Sly & The Family Stone with the same (ir)reverence it would Duke Ellington or Count Basie. By illuminating the melodic and harmonic sophistication of the iconoclast's body of work\, MTO re-imagine Sly Stone through the filter of their own "downtown NYC" aesthetic\, while still upholding the Day-Glo soul and psychedelic funk that is the backbone for classics like "M'Lady\," "Everyday People" and "Family Affair." Both the CD and LP versions of the release include extensive liner notes by Steven Bernstein and music historian Greg Tate along with never before seen photos from the recording sessions.

By the way\, the lp was produced by Mike Post\, and most of the songs were written/cowritten by him. Good stuff all around and available pretty cheap on ebay.

COL title VAL Who Is She and What Is She to You COL performer VAL Della Reese	COL video title VAL Bill Withers - Who Is He (And What Is He to You) COL description VAL Bill Withers - Who Is He (And What Is He to You)  William Harrison "Bill" Withers\, Jr. (born July 4\, 1938) is an American singer-songwriter and musician who performed and recorded from 1970 until 1985. Some of his best-known songs are "Lean on Me"\, "Ain't No Sunshine"\, "Use Me"\, "Just the Two of Us"\, "Lovely Day"\, and "Grandma's Hands". His life was recently the subject of the documentary film Still Bill. Withers was born the youngest of thirteen children in the small coal-mining town of Slab Fork\, West Virginia. Raised in nearby Beckley\, West Virginia\, Withers was thirteen years old when his father died. He enlisted with the United States Navy at age eighteen and served for nine years\, during which time he became interested in singing and writing songs. Soon after his discharge from the Navy in 1970\, he relocated to Los Angeles for a musical career. Withers worked as an assembler for several different companies\, including Douglas Aircraft Corporation\, while recording demo tapes with his own money\, shopping them around and performing in clubs at night. When he debuted with the song "Ain't No Sunshine" he refused to resign his job because of his belief that the music business was a fickle industry and that he was still a novice compared to other acts.  Lyrics  A man we passed just tried to stare me down  And when I looked at you\, you looked at the ground  I don't know who he is but I think that you do   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   I have something in my heart and in your eyes  Tell me he's not someone just passin' by  And when you cleared your throat was that your cue   Dag gummit dag  Who is he and what is he to you   Now when I add the sum of you and me  I get confused and I keep coming up with three  You're too much for one man but not enough for two   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Hey you tell me man don't have not much for intuition  That what you really think or are you wishin'  Before you wreck your old home be certain of the new   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you COL channel name VAL Alf	1
COL title VAL Run to the Hills COL performer VAL Adhesive	COL video title VAL Average White Band ~ If I Ever Lose This Heaven "1975" Funk COL description VAL Their self-effacing name to the contrary\, Average White Band was anything but -- one of the few white groups to cross the color line and achieve success and credibility playing funk\, with their tight\, fiery sound also belying their Scottish heritage\, evoking American R&B hotbeds like Detroit\, Memphis\, and Philadelphia instead. Singer/bassist Alan Gorrie\, guitarists Hamish Stuart and Onnie McIntyre\, tenor saxophonist Malcolm Duncan\, keyboardist/saxophonist Roger Ball\, and drummer Robbie McIntosh comprised the original Average White Band lineup. Veterans of numerous Scottish soul and jazz groups\, they made their debut in 1973 as the opening act at Eric Clapton's Rainbow Theatre comeback gig\, soon issuing their debut LP\, Show Your Hand\, to little notice. After adopting the abbreviated moniker AWB\, a year later the band issued their self-titled sophomore effort\, topping the American pop charts with the Arif Mardin-produced instrumental "Pick Up the Pieces." The record's mammoth success was nevertheless tempered by the September 23\, 1974 death of McIntosh\, who died at a Hollywood party after overdosing on heroin.  Cut the Cake Ex-Bloodstone drummer Steve Ferrone replaced McIntosh for AWB's third album\, 1975's Cut the Cake\, which scored a Top Ten hit with its title track as well as two other chart entries\, "If I Ever Lose This Heaven" and "School Boy Crush." (Put It Where You Want It\, issued later that same year\, was simply a retitled and repackaged Show Your Hand.) With 1976's Soul Searching\, the group reclaimed the full Average White Band name\, scoring their final Top 40 hit with "Queen of My Soul." Following the live Person to Person\, they issued Benny & Us\, a collaboration with soul legend Ben E. King. However\, after subsequent outings\, including 1978's Warmer Communications\, 1979's Feel No Fret\, and 1980's Shine\, failed to recapture the energy of AWB's peak\, the group dissolved in 1982\, with Ferrone later joining Duran Duran and Stuart recording with Paul McCartney. Gorrie\, Ball\, and McIntyre reformed Average White Band in 1989\, tapping vocalist Alex Ligertwood for their comeback effort Aftershock. Oft-sampled by hip-hop producers throughout the 1990s\, the group continued touring prior to releasing Soul Tattoo in 1996. The live album\, Face to Face\, followed three years later.

Link below COL description VAL https://youtu.be/gVrCs58PNUU This is a much better HD copy of the music\, plus Stay a Little Longer.  Westenr Swing music from the 1940s.  This has Noel Boggs on Steel\, which means after the war probably 1946. Alex Beshear on trumpet plays it without a mute.  That was quite unusual for him.  Also Tommy sings it.  When Bob made the Okey 78\, the vocalist was Danny Alguire\, who also played trumpet.  Tommy had joined the army when that session took play. So here we get to hear the way he would have done it.  Just wish the quality was better.  Notice the accordian?  Bob never used one in his recordings\, and I have to wonder where Noel plugged in his steel guitar.  Behind a tree?  Hot session\, though.

COL title VAL Cuban Love Song COL performer VAL Herbie Mann	COL video title VAL Johnny Mathis ~ Southern Nights COL description VAL This upload is in honor of Johnny's recent Grammy nomination for his latest CD: "Let It Be Me: Mathis in Nashville". I love many songs on this CD - this is one of my favorites. Love Johnny's wonderful\, contagious energy  (catch that sweet 'yeehaw' moment - s'cuze me - that's what comes when I hear it! -  at about 2:35 - and that's him in those cool\, cute sneaks movin' in Cohasset this summer)\,  and the beautiful symphonic blend of his interpretation with the incredible musicians accompanying him. In researching the song I watched several videos of Jerry Douglas (Dobro)\, Bryan Sutton (Acoustic Guitar\, Banjo\, Mandolin)\, Stuart Duncan (Fiddle\, Mandolin) and others\, all like Johnny\, gifted\, and according to executive producer Jay Lander's liner notes\,  'handpicked group of Nashville's finest" by producer Fred Molin.  If you don't own it- well worth it- and the notes\, so descriptive of each song's history. And one can't improve on Lander's further notes: "Johnny Mathis draws the listener into his world like a master storyteller.....the emotions\, in Johnny's hands\, nothing less than profound." You are not listening to a set of songs put to voice and music here. If you do what country music\, I believe 'invites' you to do\,  slow down\, listen\, take in the sounds\, the meaning\, the simplicity\, the emotions and joy\, you'll hear these stories with every nuance available. Enjoy!  And I defy your feet or body to stay still listening to this rich number! And here's to Johnny\, once again\, the consummate re-inventor of his own style\,and yet always just a step away from the 'magic' core we all love.   The song\, composed by Allen Toussaint\, was released in 1977 by Glenn Campbell and hit #1 as a 'cross over' number that year in Country\, Pop and Adult Contemporary.

You know we had no time\, We could not even try. You know we had no time.  The sky is red\, I dont understand\, Past midnight I still see the land.

COL title VAL Sugarman COL performer VAL The BossHoss	COL video title VAL LURLEAN HUNTER  Vocal Jazz Swing. Steppin' Out With My Baby \, I Feel COL description VAL Lurlean Hunter  Singer Lurlean Hunter made five albums on her own during the second half of the '50s\, starting out as a Lonesome Gal on RCA and winding up still feeling Blue & Sentimental for Atlantic. She was discovered in Chicago where she had been singing in many clubs\, including a collaboration with drummer Red Saunders that held forth at the Club DeLisa. Hunter's move to New York City in 1955 was prompted by RCA's interest in recording her. The singer's recording career actually began before she left the Windy City at the behest of indie jazz labels\, some of them quite short-lived -- such as Seymour\, with a catalog topping out at four releases. The press described Hunter as a "blues thrush" in announcing her interpretations of three numbers actually written by the label's owner\, producer and record store owner Seymour Schwartz. The latter promotional blurb inevitably told some truth about Hunter's stylistic traits\, if not her relation to winged fauna. Her recordings were more about rhythm & blues and pop than jazz\, yet were done in an era when such sessions often involved fine mainstream jazz players in the accompaniment. The 1956Night Life\, for example\, featured pianist Hank Jones and tenor saxophonist Al Cohn. Blue & Sentimental -- with arrangements by the progressive Jimmy Giuffre -- was reissued in 2000 as a split CD also including an album by fellow singer Betty Bennett\, a former wife of pianist André Previn.Hunter's final recordings were done in 1964\, at which point she was still well under 40 years old. She is known to have died young\, although details of this tragedy are murky. In one version of the story she was knocked off by a mobster lover\, yet whether anybody was really that mean to Lurlean cannot be completely confirmed.

Era el verano claro está\, y yo empezaba a soñar con mi pasado. Ante un espejo le fingí que maquillaba mi nariz para mirarle. Cuando me vi tan cerca de él había dado no sé qué por conquistarle.  Me sonrió con intención y fue su edad la explicación de su victoria. No quiso hablarme del amor\, pues según él esa cuestión es otra historia. Me dijo tú me vas muy bien\, eres igual que la mujer de "El Graduado". Yo no pude resistir y entre sus brazos descubrí\, un sol dorado.  Dieciocho años nada más eso le hizo ser audaz mas que insolente. Cuando llegué a despertar\, solo sentí la soledad indiferente. Por un momento pretendí el retenerlo junto a mí\, pero no quise. Me dijo no has estado mal\, con un candor tan infernal\, antes de irse. Entonces tuve que fingir que maquillaba mi nariz\, para no verle y estuve a punto de olvidar que yo le doblaba la edad.

This album features the likes of Clive Langer\, Ian Broudie\, James Eller and Lee "Kix" Thompson of Madness. Bette Bright (real name Anne Martin) married Graham "Suggs" McPherson (no introduction necessary) and retired from music to start a family. Recently\, however\, she has re-emerged along with Deaf School\, playing several reunion and tribute gigs. Oh and any eagle-eyes among us will have spotted a red-wigged Bette in the Sex Pistols movie Rock 'N' Roll Swindle (check the scene where Steve Jones...soils the gold record).

COL title VAL Still I'm Sad COL performer VAL Manfred Mann	COL video title VAL The Newbeats -_I'm Blue - (The Gong-Gong)_1964 Hickory.wmv COL description VAL Texan Larry Henley first performed with the Dean and Marc Combo in 1962. Business links with Nashville-based Hickory Records owner Wesley Rose rapidly led to solo releases by Larry Henley and also\, Dean and Marc.  In June 1964\, Larry\, Dean and Marc got together and cut an unusual\, falsetto-driven demo of the Everly Brothers' "Bye Bye Love." The song's composer\, Bouldleaux Bryant\, heard the dazzling demo and immediately convinced Wesley Rose to sign the trio to a separate\, (third!) recording contract. Fred Foster\, owner of Monument Records\, suggested the "Newbeats" name.  Holland Picture Sleeve - Bye Bye Love was never released on 45 in the USA  "Bye Bye Love\," "Break Away (From That Boy)" (later a #34 hit in Cash Box) and the Chevrolet Corvair tune "Tough Little Buggy" were duly recorded on June 28\, 1964. At the last minute Rose's brother-in-law suggested a song called "Bread And Butter." Dean Mathis created a new\, authoritative arrangement on the spot\, showcasing Larry Henley's scorching\, gospel-influenced falsetto.  When released\, "Bread And Butter" was buried on the 'B' side of "Tough Little Buggy." But DJs at Detroit's WKNR radio flipped the single and "Bread And Butter" blasted onto the WKNR survey the week of July 16\, 1964\, soon peaking at #1.  Nationally "Bread And Butter" shot to #2 and attained Gold sales.  The Newbeats' jaw-dropping national TV debut took place Wednesday\, September 30\, 1964 on ABC-TV's 'Shindig.'  An appearance on 'American Bandstand' came next. The group then stormed Europe via Holland's 'Grand Gala du Disque 1964\,' a widely seen\, four hour television spectacular.   Billboard September 12\, 1964  In addition to "A Patent On Love" (originally intended for Joey "Midnight Mary" Powers) and "Pink Dally Rue" (later recorded by Jimmy Elledge and Robin Wilson)\, the 'Bread & Butter' album included "Thou Shalt Not Steal\," penned by longtime Hickory confederate John D. Loudermilk ("Norman\," "Talk Back Trembling Lips"). Dick and Deedee recognized the potential of the album cut and soon lodged a version of "Thou Shalt Not Steal" at #13 on the charts (Warner single 5482). Another Loudermilk tune\, the #16 "Everything's Alright\," became the Newbeats' follow-up to "Bread And Butter."  From January 22 through February 13\, 1965\, the Newbeats toured Australia and New Zealand with the Rolling Stones\, Roy Orbison and Rolf Harris. During the tour\, Larry Henley became very close to Mick Jagger and the two even planned an album project. Hickory owner Wesley Rose managed tour headliner Roy Orbison. The Newbeats later recorded Orbison's "Oh\, Pretty Woman" and "Lookin' For Love."  "(The Bees Are For The Birds) The Birds Are For The Bees\," was written by the composers of "Bread And Butter\," Larry Parks and Jay Turnbow\, with help from Bob Finnicum. While "Bread And Butter" had referred to sex in sympathetic gastronomic terms\, the refreshingly naïve "Birds Are For The Bees" found Larry Henley (27)\, Dean Mathis (28) and Marc Mathis (25) innocently claiming\, "Grown-ups tell me the birds and the bees do other things than live in trees" and concluding\, to the astonishment of angst-ridden teen listeners\, "I don't care if they can fly it's got nothing to do with you and I."  Issued with two different front covers\, the April 1965 album 'Big Beat Sounds' showcased the Newbeats' most recent single sides. The aforementioned Larry Parks\, Jay Turnbow and Bob Finnicum contributed three additional quirky tunes to the album. 'Big Beat Sounds' also contained valuable material such as Goffin and King's lead-off cut "I Can't Hear You No More" and Keith Colley and Nancie Mantz's closer "Human Kindness."  Colley and Mantz had penned tunes for Rick Nelson ("That's All She Wrote")\, Bobby Bare ("Talk Me Some Sense") and Skeeter Davis ("Ladder Of Success"). Nanci Mantz later co-wrote several songs for the Electric Prunes\, including "I Had Too Much To Dream (Last Night)."  The driving "Little Child" was released as a single in the summer of 1965. Oddly\, it did not drive the national charts wild. But the group's publicity blitz continued unabated with appearances on ABC-TV's 'Where The Action Is' on July 20 and August 25\, 1965.  The Newbeats scored a major comeback with the September 1965 single\, "Run\, Baby Run." The #12 hit boasted exquisite vocal harmonies and a stomping Motown beat. And "Run\, Baby Run" had legs; in 1971 it went Top Ten in England. Roy Orbison and the Tremelos even cut versions of the influential tune.  November 1965 saw 'Run\, Baby Run\,' the Newbeats' third and final Hickory album. Remakes of the Isley Brothers' "This Old Heart" and the Supremes' "Come See About Me" boldly demonstrated the influence of Motown soul while covers of "Help" and "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction" recognized the Beatles and Rolling Stones.

COL title VAL Big Bad John COL performer VAL The Charlie Daniels Band	COL video title VAL BIG BAD JOHN ~ Jimmy Dean  (1961) COL description VAL BIG BAD JOHN ~ Jimmy Dean  (1961) Columbia # CL 1735   Jimmy Dean - (August 10\, 1928 – June 13\, 2010) Birth name: Jimmy Ray Dean  Birth place: Plainview\, Texas Place of death: Varina\, Virginia (at 81 years old)  Per the notes written on the back of the JIMMY DEAN: BIG BAD JOHN AND OTHER FABULOUS SONGS AND TALES (Columbia LP #CL 1735) record jacket\, it states:  "Jimmy Dean had been thinking for some time of writing a song about a PAUL BUNYAN-like hero.  He began writing the lyrics at home\, but never quite finished them\, because he had to fly to Nashville\, Tennessee for a recording session with veteran Columbia producer\, Don Law. Jimmy simply brought along the unfinished song. By the time he got off the plane\, he was virtually jumping with excitement. The song was completed and Don Law liked it so much\, that Big Bad John was recorded immediately" - (Side note: There's a little touch of "Sixteen Tons" by Tennessee Ernie Ford here as well) -  Note: What many today call\, "rapping" was originally\, in a cleaner form\, referred to as\,  "calling". Talking in rhyming sentences or speaking the lyrics instead of singing them\, which was very common in Country & Western music. It began with the square dance "caller" who gave direction to the dancers\, through rhyming sentences set to the cadence or beat of the music being played by a live band. He never sang\, he just spoke the words in rhyme. Much the same as a auction house auctioneer\, who speaks the bids in a fast rhythm\, choosing words which often rhyme.  The "caller" and the dance can be:  "traced back through England  to the old French cotillions" (17th century) (per Lloyd Shaw-1939). Also\, a form of "calling" or "auction house crying" can be found in the 1947 recording of\, "Smoke\, Smoke\, Smoke (That Cigarette) (Tex Williams & Phil Harris) or "The Darktown Poker Club" (1946) (Phil Harris) for example\, and many other older recordings. Therefore\, "rap" isn't new\, it's just a continuation of something which started many years earlier. (* No one has ever said this\,  but I believe\, "Cajun Doll"\, by Lattie Moore\,  may have inspired the writing of both "Big Bad John" and "The Cajun Queen". ) COL channel name VAL MrRJDB1969	1
COL title VAL Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands COL performer VAL Steve Howe	COL video title VAL Joan Baez : Sad-Eyed Lady Of The Lowlands COL description VAL From her 1968 album\, "Any Day Now: Songs of Bob Dylan"\, Joan Baez sings the song Dylan wrote (apparently) for Sara Lownds\, the woman he began seeing after his love relationship with Baez ended. "Sad-Eyed Lady Of The Lowlands" was the closing song on Dylan's 1966 album\, "Blonde On Blonde".  Joan Baez recorded her Dylan tribute in a Nashville studio cutting country-inflected renditions of 16 Dylan songs. She was backed by Pete Drake\, David Briggs\, Norbert Putnam\, Jerry Reed\, Stephen Stills\, and others. "Any Day Now" remains one of Baez's essential recordings. COL channel name VAL paganmaestro	1

COL title VAL Fame COL performer VAL Jodie Steele	COL video title VAL LURLEAN HUNTER  Vocal Jazz Swing. Steppin' Out With My Baby \, I Feel COL description VAL Lurlean Hunter  Singer Lurlean Hunter made five albums on her own during the second half of the '50s\, starting out as a Lonesome Gal on RCA and winding up still feeling Blue & Sentimental for Atlantic. She was discovered in Chicago where she had been singing in many clubs\, including a collaboration with drummer Red Saunders that held forth at the Club DeLisa. Hunter's move to New York City in 1955 was prompted by RCA's interest in recording her. The singer's recording career actually began before she left the Windy City at the behest of indie jazz labels\, some of them quite short-lived -- such as Seymour\, with a catalog topping out at four releases. The press described Hunter as a "blues thrush" in announcing her interpretations of three numbers actually written by the label's owner\, producer and record store owner Seymour Schwartz. The latter promotional blurb inevitably told some truth about Hunter's stylistic traits\, if not her relation to winged fauna. Her recordings were more about rhythm & blues and pop than jazz\, yet were done in an era when such sessions often involved fine mainstream jazz players in the accompaniment. The 1956Night Life\, for example\, featured pianist Hank Jones and tenor saxophonist Al Cohn. Blue & Sentimental -- with arrangements by the progressive Jimmy Giuffre -- was reissued in 2000 as a split CD also including an album by fellow singer Betty Bennett\, a former wife of pianist André Previn.Hunter's final recordings were done in 1964\, at which point she was still well under 40 years old. She is known to have died young\, although details of this tragedy are murky. In one version of the story she was knocked off by a mobster lover\, yet whether anybody was really that mean to Lurlean cannot be completely confirmed.

It is now out of print and fairly pricey\, so here's a vinyl rip for your enjoyment. Bette Bright was originally a prominent vocalist with Liverpool legends Deaf School before her solo career. This album features the likes of Clive Langer\, Ian Broudie\, James Eller and Lee "Kix" Thompson of Madness. Bette Bright (real name Anne Martin) married Graham "Suggs" McPherson (no introduction necessary) and retired from music to start a family. Recently\, however\, she has re-emerged along with Deaf School\, playing several reunion and tribute gigs. Oh and any eagle-eyes among us will have spotted a red-wigged Bette in the Sex Pistols movie Rock 'N' Roll Swindle (check the scene where Steve Jones...soils the gold record).

Nombres como Henry Prado\, Gilberto Urdaneta\, Pedro Alfonso\, Heberto Medina\, Rafael Montero\, Paco Piedrafita y Edgar Alexander mencionamos al hablar de algunos de los miembros (Fundadores y no Fundadores) que se encargaron de dar a conocer este género en Venezuela\, Caracterizados por sus excelentes composiciones y sobretodo por versionar temas de sus más grandes influencias\, (The Beatles)\, Los Impala son considerados los pioneros de este género musical en Venezuela\, siendo la primera agrupación en llevar Buen Rock And Roll a los Hogares de los Venezolanos. En esta oportunidad de su disco "Los Impala" de 1964 extraemos el tema "La Noche Anterior" (A Night Before) original del cuarteto de Liverpool\, The Beatles\, compuesto por John Lennon Y Paul McCartney.

Era el verano claro está\, y yo empezaba a soñar con mi pasado. Ante un espejo le fingí que maquillaba mi nariz para mirarle. Cuando me vi tan cerca de él había dado no sé qué por conquistarle.  Me sonrió con intención y fue su edad la explicación de su victoria. No quiso hablarme del amor\, pues según él esa cuestión es otra historia. Me dijo tú me vas muy bien\, eres igual que la mujer de "El Graduado". Yo no pude resistir y entre sus brazos descubrí\, un sol dorado.  Dieciocho años nada más eso le hizo ser audaz mas que insolente. Cuando llegué a despertar\, solo sentí la soledad indiferente. Por un momento pretendí el retenerlo junto a mí\, pero no quise. Me dijo no has estado mal\, con un candor tan infernal\, antes de irse. Entonces tuve que fingir que maquillaba mi nariz\, para no verle y estuve a punto de olvidar que yo le doblaba la edad.

In June 1987 Gerald Arthur Friend picked up a 14-year-old female friend after leaving a concert at the Tacoma Dome. Upon trying to exit the car the girl was handcuffed and held hostage at knife point. The girl was taken to a mobile home where she was tortured and raped with various objects for two days. She was also threatened with a blowtorch."  we recorded our cover of "polly" for SPIN magazine's "Newermind" tribute/compilation to mark the 20th anniversary of "Nevermind" in september. michael (who a lot of you have seen as the new drummer of my touring band\, the grand theft orchestra) produced/engineered and played bass on the recording.  this is a video me (glockenspiel\, vocals\, Taurus bass pedal)\, chad raines (banjo\, percussion)\, and michael (bass\, percussion) shot in new haven\, CT on a super-tight budget with the help of some actors and filmmakers from around new york and yale.   we filmed it in one day in november...i wrote the script and michael directed the video. blake\, who plays the angel\, is also on the cover of the first dolls' album "a is for accident"...looking very different in a long red dress.  so many people loaned us stuff and worked for free on this video to keep us under budget - THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH.  x afp ________________  FULL CREDITS & THANK YOUS...  song by NIRVANA  starring CHRISTOPHER M.

COL title VAL You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine COL performer VAL Lou Rawls	COL video title VAL BERT HEERINK STORM NA DE STILTE Rocksterren COL description VAL I DO NOT OWN THIS VIDEO. © (c)Copyright belongs to the rightful owner  Bert Heerink (Utrecht\, 26 januari 1953) is een Nederlandse muzikant. Heerink werd voornamelijk bekend als zanger van de Nederlandse hardrockband Vandenberg\, die ook internationaal succes had.Met Vandenberg had Heerink in de jaren 80 twee wereldhits: Burning Heart en Different Worlds. Nadat Vandenberg de samenwerking met Heerink beëindigde trad Bert toe tot de heavy metal band Picture en nam een aantal Nederlandstalige albums op. Bekend werd hij verder door in 1995 voor een aantal reclames voor Heineken Nederlandstalige teksten te zingen op melodieën van oude rocknummers. De nummers Zon in de Winter\, Doe wat je wil en Julie July werden hits. Voor het album Storm na de Stilte kreeg hij een gouden plaat.Bij de reünie van Kayak  in 2000 werd Heerink zanger van deze band en bleef dit tot 2006. In 2002 toert Bert met het orkest van de Koninklijke Luchtmacht door Nederland in de hoofdrol van "Tommy".Met Peter Groot Kormelink en Erik Mesie vormt Heerink het muzikale feestprogramma "De Heeren van Oranje" waarin alle grote hits van de 3 Heeren voorbij komen.Bert neemt in 2005/2006 ook vocalen voor zijn rekening tijdens de succesvolle tour van het orkest van Koninklijke Luchtmacht door de Nederlandse theaters: Queen in concert\, waarbij diverse Queen klassiekers worden vertolkt. Sommige nummers worden ook in een nieuw jasje gestoken\, zoals 'Crazy little thing called love'\, welke een big band sausje krijgt.In 2006 heeft Bert Heerink samen met zijn zus Saskia onder de naam Heerink een album uitgebracht met de naam Purify. Het album wordt gekenmerkt door een persoonlijke inslag.In 2007 en ook in 2008 maakte Heerink met het Noord Nederlands Orkest (NNO) onder leiding van de Belgische dirigent Dirk Brossé met het cross-overprogramma Symphonic echoes of Pink Floyd een tournee\, waarin de grote hits van de Engelse rockformatie centraal staan. Naast Heerink nemen Antonie Kamerling en Erik Mesie de zangpartijen voor hun rekening\, bijgestaan door onder meer gitarist Joost Vergoossen.Het wordt het tot dan toe best bezochte concertjaar met ruim 98.000 bezoekers. In 2008 vervangt Chris Zeegers Antonie Kamerling bij deze productie.Tegenwoordig (2006) woont Heerink in Hoogeveen. Recentelijk bracht Heerink de single "When I close my eyes"\, uit. De single is uitsluitend via de website www.bertheerink.nl te downloaden en de opbrengst gaat naar de stichting KidsRights die zich wereldwijd inzet voor de rechten van kinderen. Op 6 december 2008 ontving Bert Heerink het Lidmaatschap in de Orde van Oranje Nassau als waardering voor zijn inzet en prestaties in de popmuziek en zijn inzet voor de kinderrechtenorganisatie KidsRights. Eerder ontving Bert Heerink in Hoogeveen om dezelfde reden een eigen ster in de "Walk of Veen".In april 2009 brengt Heerink samen met collega's Erik Mesie en Peter Groot Kormelink onder de naam "Heeren van Oranje" hun eerste eigen single uit; "Made in Holland" waarmee ze landelijk debuteerden op het Tros Muziekfeest in Middelburg. In samenwerking met OAR Heaven Records werkt Bert vanaf mei 2009 in Duitsland in de studio van Michael Voss aan een volledig eigen Engelstalig rockalbum. De uitnodiging een dergelijk album te maken kwam na het meewerken aan het tweede "Voices of Rock" album waar Bert met "Shame on you" op vertegenwoordigd is. Het album komt op 25 september wereldwijd uit en bevat nummers van grote songwriters als Jeff Silbard (Wind beneath my Wings) en Russ Ballard.In februari 2010 komt de eerste single van dit album "Panic Attack" binnen in de single top 100 waarna deze doorstijgt en hoog in de charts komt. Een tweede stuk "All fired Up" wordt tegelijkertijd door het TT Circuit Assen gekozen tot de seizoenstune. Op 3 april trad Heerink tijdens de 5e uitreiking van de Eddie Christiani Award\, die hijzelf opnieuw presenteerde\,op met Steve Lukather\, (gitarist/zanger van Toto) de winnaar van deze editie.

It was also used as the B-side of their 1967 single "All You Need Is Love". New mixes of the song were made available on the compilation albums Magical Mystery Tour and Yellow Submarine Songtrack.  Composition  Two song fragments were combined to create "Baby\, You're a Rich Man". The verses from "One of the Beautiful People" by John Lennon were combined with Paul McCartney's previously unaccompanied "Baby\, you're a rich man ..." chorus. Two songs were combined in a similar fashion to make "A Day in the Life"\, and "I've Got a Feeling".  Recording  The song was recorded and mixed (in mono) on 11 May 1967 at Olympic Sound Studios. The music featured an unusual oboe-like sound which was created with a clavioline (an early forerunner of the synthesiser) and a spin-echo (feed back delay) effect which was used to fill from the end of one line of the verse to the start of the next.  Personnel  Per Lewisohn & MacDonald:  John Lennon -- double-tracked vocal\, clavioline\, piano Paul McCartney -- harmony vocal\, piano\, bass George Harrison -- harmony vocal\, guitar\, handclaps Ringo Starr -- drums\, tambourine\, maracas\, handclaps Brian Jones -- oboe Eddie Kramer -- vibraphone George Martin -- producer Keith Grant -- engineer  Mick Jagger was also present and his name appears on a session tape box\, possibly indicating that he provided backing vocals near the end of the song.

The Rutles performed the fictional song "Abie You're a Rich Man".  A Disney remake of the Yellow Submarine film\, slated for release in 2012\, will include "Baby\, You're a Rich Man".  ------------------------  Lyrics  How does it feel to be One of the beautiful people? Now that you know who you are What do you want to be? And have you travelled very far? Far as the eye can see. How does it feel to be One of the beautiful people? How often have you been there? Often enough to know. What did you see\, when you were there? Nothing that doesn't show. Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man too. You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo. What a thing to do. Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man too. How does it feel to be One of the beautiful people? Tuned to a natural E Happy to be that way. Now that you've found another key What are you going to play? Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man too. You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo. What a thing to do. Baby you're a rich man...

COL title VAL Squid Jiggin' Ground COL performer VAL Harry Hibbs	COL video title VAL Henry Mancini -   Tiny Bubbles COL description VAL "I think there is a song out there to describe just about any situation."― Criss Jami ▼▼▼  HENRY MANCINI Enrico Nicola "Henry" Mancini was an American composer\, arranger and conductor\, who is best remembered for his film and television scores.  He won a record number of Grammy Awards\, plus a posthumous Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995. His best-known works include the jazz-idiom theme to The Pink Panther film series ("The Pink Panther Theme") and the theme to the Peter Gunn television series.  Mancini had a long collaboration with the film director Blake Edwards and won numerous Academy Awards for the songs in Edwards films\, including "Moon River" from Breakfast at Tiffany's\, "Days of Wine and Roses" and for the score to "Victor Victoria". Entering 1946\, Mancini became a pianist and arranger for the newly re-formed Glenn Miller Orchestra\, led by 'Everyman' Tex Beneke. After World War II\, Mancini broadened his skills in composition\, counterpoint\, harmony and orchestration during studies opening with the composers Ernst Krenek and Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco.  In 1952\, Mancini joined the Universal Pictures music department. During the next six years\, he contributed music to over 100 movies\, most notably The Creature from the Black Lagoon\, It Came from Outer Space\, Tarantula\, This Island Earth\, The Glenn Miller Story (for which he received his first Academy Award nomination)\, The Benny Goodman Story and Orson Welles' Touch of Evil. During this time\, he also wrote some popular songs. His first hit was a single by Guy Lombardo and His Royal Canadians titled I Won't Let You Out of My Heart. Mancini left Universal to work as an independent composer/arranger in 1958. Soon after\, he scored the television series Peter Gunn for writer/producer Blake Edwards. This was the genesis of a relationship in which Edwards and Mancini collaborated on 30 films over 35 years.  Along with Alex North\, Elmer Bernstein\, Leith Stevens and Johnny Mandel\, Henry Mancini was a pioneer of the inclusion of jazz elements in the late romantic orchestral film and TV scoring prevalent at the time. Mancini scored many TV movies\, including The Thorn Birds and The Shadow Box. He wrote many television themes\, including Mr. Lucky (starring John Vivyan and Ross Martin)\, NBC Mystery Movie\, What's Happening\, Tic Tac Dough (1990 version) and Once Is Not Enough. In the 1984--85 television season\, four series featured original Mancini themes: Newhart\, Hotel\, Remington Steele\, and Ripley's Believe It or Not. Mancini also composed the "Viewer Mail" theme for Late Night with David Letterman. Mancini composed the theme for NBC Nightly News used beginning in 1975\, and a different theme by him\, titled Salute to the President was used by NBC News for its election coverage (including primaries and conventions) from 1976 to 1992. Salute to the President was only published in a school-band arrangement\, although Mancini performed it frequently with symphony orchestras on his concert tours. Songs with music by Mancini were staples of the easy listening genre from the 1960s to the 1980s. Some of the artists who have recorded Mancini songs include Andy Williams\, Paul Anka\, Pat Boone\, Anita Bryant\, Jack Jones\, Frank Sinatra\, Perry Como\, Connie Francis\, Eydie Gorme\, Steve Lawrence\, Trini Lopez\, George Maharis\, Johnny Mathis\, Jerry Vale and Ray Conniff\, to name just a few.... Mancini recorded over 90 albums\, in styles ranging from big band to light classical to pop. Eight of these albums were certified gold by The Recording Industry Association of America. He had a 20-year contract with RCA Records\, resulting in 60 commercial record albums that made him a household name among artists of easy-listening music.  TINY BUBBLES "Tiny Bubbles" is a song written by Martin Denny and Leon Pober. It was released in 1966 by Don Ho.  It is widely considered to be Denny's most famous song.  MHO "Tiny Bubbles" is -\, with all due respect for Mr Denny\, a rather "simple" song but... hand the notes to a top arranger like Henry Mancini and .... what you get is a fabulous orchestral arrangement that\, in a way\, transforms the song into an easy floating ballad.  A particularly rich instrumentation with strings\, brass\, and all the other "standard" instruments of a large orchestra\, completed with the sound of the ukelele and harp\, so typical for the Hawaiian style music.

Says your aul' wan to my aul' wan\, "Sure I haven't got a farthing. I've just been down to Monto town To see uncle McArdle But he half a crown For to go to the Waxies dargle."  Cho: What are ye having\, will ye have a pint? Yes\, I'll have a pint with you\, sir\, And if one of us doesn't order soon We'll be thrown out of the boozer.  Says my aul' wan to your aul' wan "Will ye come to the Galway races?" Says your aul' wan to my aul' wan\, "With the price of my aul' lad's braces. I went down to Capel Street To the Jew man moneylenders But they wouldn't give me a couple of bob on My aul' lad's suspenders."  Says my aul' wan to your aul' wan "We have no beef or mutton But if we go down to Monto town We might get a drink for nuttin'" Here's a piece of good advice I got from an aul' fishmonger: "When food is scarce and you see the hearse You'll know you have died of hunger.  Let the grasses grow and the waters flow\, In a free and easy way\, But give me enough of that rare old stuff\, That's made near Galway Bay. Come gougers all\, From Donegal\, Sligo and Leitrim too\, And we'll give you the slip as we take a sip\, Of the rare old mountain dew.  At the foot of the hill there's a neat little still\, Where the smoke curls up to the sky; By the whiff of the smell you can plainly tell There's poitin boys nearby. For it fills the air\, with a perfume rare\, That betwixt both me and you\, And as on we roll\, we'll drink a bowl\, Or a bucketfull of mountain dew.  Now learned men who use the pen Have wrote the praises high; Of the sweet poitin from Ireland green\, Distilled with wheat and rye. Forget your pills\,it will cure all ills Of the Pagan\, Christian or Jew\, Take off your coat and wet your throat With the rare old mountain dew. COL channel name VAL FourToTheBar	0

COL title VAL True Love Travels on a Gravel Road COL performer VAL Afghan Whigs	COL video title VAL Swinging London: Jack Hylton - A Precious Little Thing Called Love\, 1929 COL description VAL Jack Hylton & His Orchestra with Vocal Refrain - A Precious Little Thing Called Love (Davis /Coots) Fox-trot from the film "The Shopworn Angel"\, HMV (UK)  NOTE: "The Shopworn angel" was in the US a Big Hey of the year 1928/29 - possibly\, because of featured fantastic duo: the most handsome actor of the world\, Gary Cooper (here\, even more handsome in his soldier's suit) and Nancy Carroll  - who was one of  the most charming "it" girls of the Roaring Twenties. This partially sound movie tells an interesting story of the young and naive soldier from Texas (Gary Cooper) who - before his shipping off  to Europe (World War 1) meets a sophisticated music hall star and convinces her to play the role of his girlfriend\, to impress his buddies. Alas\, the good hearted country bumpkin dies on the war and the girl\, who feels almost in love with him\, has to find her way back to the abandoned boyfriend of her (Paul Lukas). The film's leading tune: "A Precious Little Thing Called Love" has quickly became the world evergreens and one of the trade marks of the American Roaring Twenties. Among hundreds of renditions\, dear old Jackie Hylton from London has done an exceptionally good  job to make this song a real gem. COL channel name VAL 240252	0

COL description VAL The Walker Brothers were an American pop group of the 1960s and 1970s\, comprising Scott Engel (eventually known professionally as Scott Walker)\, John Walker (born John Maus\, but using the name Walker since his teens)\, and Gary Leeds (eventually known as Gary Walker). After moving to Britain in 1965\, they had a number of top ten albums and singles there\, including the No. 1 chart hits "Make It Easy on Yourself" and "The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine (Anymore)\," both of which also made the US top 20.  Formed in 1964\, they adopted the 'Walker Brothers' name even though the members are all unrelated as a show business touch—"simply because we liked it." They provided a unique counterpoint to the British Invasion in that they were a group from the United States that achieved much more success in the United Kingdom than in their home country\, during the period when the popularity of British bands such as The Beatles dominated the US.

(don't confuse  with many other compilations\, they has another 1996 re-recorded version)  NO JIVE is ABSOLUTELY THE BEST COMPILATION ABOUT JOSE FELICIANO 2 CD with his hit and many rarities never released before and many intrumentals  The song is also famous in the cover by George Benson in his hit album "Breezin" from 1976 and recently sampled by DJ Nujabes in Counting Stars part of the Samurai Champloo line up as "Shino's Theme" Video isn't of the.... Vinyl Version!!  here the story "How George Benson covered Affirmation by Jose Feliciano" by his producer LiPuma  A review by '70s for Breezin LP  Though Side One of Breezin' had the hits\, Side Two was a creamy\, seamless masterpiece unto itself. It unfolded with "Affirmation\," a song composed by Jose Feliciano\, the international superstar singer/guitarist/composer who had recorded it on his album\, Just Wanna Rock 'N' Roll (RCA)\, from the fall of '75. "Affirmation" was the sole instrumental on that Feliciano LP\, providing the blind Puerto Rican wunderkind a golden opportunity to showcase his skills on acoustic Spanish guitar\, electric rhythm guitar (with a wah-wah effect)\, electric bass\, congas and as a string arranger! LiPuma was enchanted with the melody of Feliciano's relatively brief (3:33) recording. When material was being prepared for Breezin'\, he presented it to Benson\, who liked it immediately. The band worked up an arrangement that loosened and elongated the vibe of the original. Like Feliciano's version\, George begins "Affirmation" alone\, caressing an introduction of choice notes and a smooth rendering of its signature run down the frets. But when the rhythm section eases in\, led by MacDonald's congas\, the groove is more relaxed and funky in a way that is quite different from Feliciano's more insistent arrangement\, which throbbed with forthright Latin pride. Where Feliciano had his rhythm section drop out for the soaring bridge\, Benson's band rides it like the wind\, drummer Mason liberating the rhythm by opening up on his cymbals. Benson tickles the strings with a tasty solo that leads into the killer breakdown section\, with Upchurch dipping into his effects bag. And then\, in what has to be one of the all-time classiest hand-offs in music\, Benson makes way for Dalto's wistful electric piano (complete with soulful little comps) before Benson takes it home\, getting in a few final signature licks. Benson's "Affirmation" is seven minutes of masterful musical heaven. http://www.fantasticfeliciano.too.it/ COL channel name VAL Thevolumex	0

This album is hard to find and commands a decent price tag but it was re-issued a few years ago and should now be available to a larger audience at last.  In my opinion Ellie Pop were treading their own path in 1968\, there's no fuzz\, no psych touches\, no 1968isms of heavy guitars and keyboards. What you get is a collection of beautifully constructed pop songs that suggest a big Anglophile influence\, in particular mid-60s period Beatles. They sound similar to say The Merry-Go-Round or The Left Banke but without the baroque touches. Just pure pop\, or should I say Ellie Pop.  Virtually every review I've read online or in Shindig for instance\, fails to mention that 'Whatcha Gonna Do 'Bout It' is a cover of a Hollies cut they recorded in 1963 for their debut album 'Stay With The Hollies.' Ellie Pop wrote all of their own tunes except this one!  I'm not certain where Ellie Pop hailed from or even the full names of the group members but it has been suggested elsewhere that they were from Detroit. Maybe someone can confirm this?  http://expo67-cavestones.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/ellie-pop-whatcha-gonna-do-bout-it.html COL channel name VAL ACID REVOLVER	0

Lyrics:  Helplessly hoping Her harlequin hovers nearby Awaiting a word Gasping at glimpses Of gentle true spirit He runs\, wishing he could fly Only to trip at the sound of good-bye  Wordlessly watching He waits by the window And wonders  At the empty place inside Heartlessly helping himself to her bad dreams He worries Did he hear a good-bye? Or even hello?  They are one person They are two alone They are three together They are for each other  Stand by the stairway You'll see something Certain to tell you confusion has its cost Love isn't lying It's loose in a lady who lingers Saying she is lost And choking on hello  They are one person They are two alone They are three together They are for each other COL channel name VAL Hoodoo You Love?	0

COL title VAL High Hopes COL performer VAL Fuzzbox	COL video title VAL Betty Johnson -- I Need You Now (VintageMusic.es) COL description VAL Betty Johnson 16 de marzo 1929 (otras fuentes dicen 1931)  es una cantante norteamericana que alcanzó su pico de carrera en la década de 1950. Cuando era adolescente\, fue contratada por Columbia Records e hizo algunas grabaciones\, ninguna de las cuales tuvieron éxito. En 1951\, Percy Faith \, que la había conocido por sus grabaciones de Columbia\, trató de convencer a Mitch Miller ( A & R\, el director de Columbia) para firmar con ella\, pero Miller\, que incluye Doris Day y Rosemary Clooney \, entre los artistas que habían firmado\, no veía la necesidad firmar con ella.  Johnson lanzó el álbum para niños\, con Eddy Arnold producido por Simon and Schuster \, que posteriormente la contrató para su propio sello discográfico\, Bell Records en 1954. En el mismo año firmó un contrato con Csida-Grean\, una sociedad de gestión que había manejado la carrera de Arnold. Charles Grean\, miembro  de esa compañía\,  produjo muchas de sus grabaciones posteriores. En 1955\, firmó un contrato con RCA Victor Records \, que la envió a Chicago\, Illinois .  En Chicago\, Johnson trabajó con Arnold de nuevo en su  serie\, Eddy Arnold Time\, respaldado por un grupo que había trabajado con su familia en el Grand Ole Opry\, The Jordanaires . Este grupo más tarde fue conocido como un grupo de apoyo de Elvis Presley .  En 1957 se casó con Grean\, aunque el matrimonio sólo duraría hasta 1961\, la relación profesional continuó. Luego fue contratada por Jack Paar para su programa de televisión\, Tonight . Esto condujo a un contrato discográfico con Atlantic Records en 1957\, para el que tuvo su próximo gran éxito\, "Little Blue Man".  Johnson continuó en Tonight hasta 1962 cuando Jack Paar fue reemplazado por Johnny Carson.

COL title VAL Robins and Roses COL performer VAL Bing Crosby with Victor Young and His Orchestra	COL video title VAL Bill Withers - Who Is He (And What Is He to You) COL description VAL Bill Withers - Who Is He (And What Is He to You)  William Harrison "Bill" Withers\, Jr. (born July 4\, 1938) is an American singer-songwriter and musician who performed and recorded from 1970 until 1985. Some of his best-known songs are "Lean on Me"\, "Ain't No Sunshine"\, "Use Me"\, "Just the Two of Us"\, "Lovely Day"\, and "Grandma's Hands". His life was recently the subject of the documentary film Still Bill. Withers was born the youngest of thirteen children in the small coal-mining town of Slab Fork\, West Virginia. Raised in nearby Beckley\, West Virginia\, Withers was thirteen years old when his father died. He enlisted with the United States Navy at age eighteen and served for nine years\, during which time he became interested in singing and writing songs. Soon after his discharge from the Navy in 1970\, he relocated to Los Angeles for a musical career. Withers worked as an assembler for several different companies\, including Douglas Aircraft Corporation\, while recording demo tapes with his own money\, shopping them around and performing in clubs at night. When he debuted with the song "Ain't No Sunshine" he refused to resign his job because of his belief that the music business was a fickle industry and that he was still a novice compared to other acts.  Lyrics  A man we passed just tried to stare me down  And when I looked at you\, you looked at the ground  I don't know who he is but I think that you do   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   I have something in my heart and in your eyes  Tell me he's not someone just passin' by  And when you cleared your throat was that your cue   Dag gummit dag  Who is he and what is he to you   Now when I add the sum of you and me  I get confused and I keep coming up with three  You're too much for one man but not enough for two   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Hey you tell me man don't have not much for intuition  That what you really think or are you wishin'  Before you wreck your old home be certain of the new   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you COL channel name VAL Alf	0

COL title VAL Midnight at the Oasis COL performer VAL Sun City Girls	COL video title VAL Affirmation - Jose Feliciano Original 1975 (also by Nujabes Counting Stars cover by George Benson) COL description VAL https://www.facebook.com/Jose-Feliciano-Fan-Area-1387556718159682  Affirmation Instrumental by Jose Feliciano recorded in his 1975 RCA album "Just Wann Rock'n'Roll"  FINALLY in CD !!!  in a new FANTASTIC COMPILATION for Jose Feliciano called "NO JIVE"...  (don't confuse  with many other compilations\, they has another 1996 re-recorded version)  NO JIVE is ABSOLUTELY THE BEST COMPILATION ABOUT JOSE FELICIANO 2 CD with his hit and many rarities never released before and many intrumentals  The song is also famous in the cover by George Benson in his hit album "Breezin" from 1976 and recently sampled by DJ Nujabes in Counting Stars part of the Samurai Champloo line up as "Shino's Theme" Video isn't of the.... Vinyl Version!!  here the story "How George Benson covered Affirmation by Jose Feliciano" by his producer LiPuma  A review by '70s for Breezin LP  Though Side One of Breezin' had the hits\, Side Two was a creamy\, seamless masterpiece unto itself. It unfolded with "Affirmation\," a song composed by Jose Feliciano\, the international superstar singer/guitarist/composer who had recorded it on his album\, Just Wanna Rock 'N' Roll (RCA)\, from the fall of '75. "Affirmation" was the sole instrumental on that Feliciano LP\, providing the blind Puerto Rican wunderkind a golden opportunity to showcase his skills on acoustic Spanish guitar\, electric rhythm guitar (with a wah-wah effect)\, electric bass\, congas and as a string arranger! LiPuma was enchanted with the melody of Feliciano's relatively brief (3:33) recording. When material was being prepared for Breezin'\, he presented it to Benson\, who liked it immediately. The band worked up an arrangement that loosened and elongated the vibe of the original. Like Feliciano's version\, George begins "Affirmation" alone\, caressing an introduction of choice notes and a smooth rendering of its signature run down the frets. But when the rhythm section eases in\, led by MacDonald's congas\, the groove is more relaxed and funky in a way that is quite different from Feliciano's more insistent arrangement\, which throbbed with forthright Latin pride. Where Feliciano had his rhythm section drop out for the soaring bridge\, Benson's band rides it like the wind\, drummer Mason liberating the rhythm by opening up on his cymbals. Benson tickles the strings with a tasty solo that leads into the killer breakdown section\, with Upchurch dipping into his effects bag. And then\, in what has to be one of the all-time classiest hand-offs in music\, Benson makes way for Dalto's wistful electric piano (complete with soulful little comps) before Benson takes it home\, getting in a few final signature licks. Benson's "Affirmation" is seven minutes of masterful musical heaven. http://www.fantasticfeliciano.too.it/ COL channel name VAL Thevolumex	0

COL title VAL A Winter's Tale COL performer VAL Mike Batt	COL video title VAL Gregorian - Brothers in Arms COL description VAL Album: The Masterpieces  Lyrics:   These mist covered mountains  Are a home now for me  But my home is the lowlands  And always will be.  Some day you'll return to  Your valleys and your farms  And you'll no longer burn  To be brothers in arms.    Through these fields of destruction  Baptism of fire  I've witnessed your suffering  As the battle raged higher.  And though they did hurt me so bad  In my fear and alarm  You did not desert me  My brothers in arms.    There's so many different worlds  So many different suns  And we have just one world  But we live in different ones.    Now the sun's gone to hell  And the moon's riding high  Let me bid you farewell  Every man has to die.  But it's written in the starlight  And every line in your palm  We're fools to make war  On our brothers in arms... COL channel name VAL UFCHeadhunter	0
COL title VAL Tenia dieciocho años COL performer VAL Dalida	COL video title VAL Lazlo Bane - Cruel To Be Kind COL description VAL Cruel to Be Kind (with lyrics) covered by Lazlo Bane. Song extracted from Guilty Pleasures. The original version of this song is performed by Nick Lowe.  If you like this\, you can also listen to other tracks here  http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/lazlobane3  Guilty Pleasures is a 2007 album by the band Lazlo Bane\, consisting entirely of cover versions of various hits from the 1970s. The idea to record an album of covers appeared when someone remarked that Lazlo Bane sounded a bit like the 70's band\, Steeler's Wheel. The next day\, the band were asked to record a 70's driving song for a scene in a movie. Lazlo Bane chose "Stuck in the Middle with You" and it became the very first song for the new album.  The titles of several songs were changed. The first song\, listed as "Get Right Back"\, is actually titled "Right Back Where We Started From". The fifth song\, listed as "Lime in the Coconut"\, is actually titled "Coconut". The sixth song\, listed as "Alone Again"\, is actually titled "Alone Again (Naturally)".  TRACKLIST: 1. Get Right Back 2. Stuck in the Middle of You 3.Lonely Boy 4. I'm Not in Love 5. Lime in the Coconut 6. Alone Again 7. Baby Come Back 8. Take the Long Way Home 9. Nothing from Nothing 10.

COL title VAL My Attorney Bernie COL performer VAL Blossom Dearie	COL video title VAL LURLEAN HUNTER  Vocal Jazz Swing. Steppin' Out With My Baby \, I Feel COL description VAL Lurlean Hunter  Singer Lurlean Hunter made five albums on her own during the second half of the '50s\, starting out as a Lonesome Gal on RCA and winding up still feeling Blue & Sentimental for Atlantic. She was discovered in Chicago where she had been singing in many clubs\, including a collaboration with drummer Red Saunders that held forth at the Club DeLisa. Hunter's move to New York City in 1955 was prompted by RCA's interest in recording her. The singer's recording career actually began before she left the Windy City at the behest of indie jazz labels\, some of them quite short-lived -- such as Seymour\, with a catalog topping out at four releases. The press described Hunter as a "blues thrush" in announcing her interpretations of three numbers actually written by the label's owner\, producer and record store owner Seymour Schwartz. The latter promotional blurb inevitably told some truth about Hunter's stylistic traits\, if not her relation to winged fauna. Her recordings were more about rhythm & blues and pop than jazz\, yet were done in an era when such sessions often involved fine mainstream jazz players in the accompaniment. The 1956Night Life\, for example\, featured pianist Hank Jones and tenor saxophonist Al Cohn. Blue & Sentimental -- with arrangements by the progressive Jimmy Giuffre -- was reissued in 2000 as a split CD also including an album by fellow singer Betty Bennett\, a former wife of pianist André Previn.Hunter's final recordings were done in 1964\, at which point she was still well under 40 years old. She is known to have died young\, although details of this tragedy are murky. In one version of the story she was knocked off by a mobster lover\, yet whether anybody was really that mean to Lurlean cannot be completely confirmed.

COL title VAL Clementine COL performer VAL George Hamilton IV	COL video title VAL Les Terribles - Ce n'est pas une vie COL description VAL Ready for an amazing 60's dance party? Well\, don't forget to bring this platter to the DJ! This band from Paris\, France plays an incredible mix of 60's garage-punk & GoGo Beat and now finally returns with their second longplayer 'Ils sont formidables!'. The band that includes members of THE NO TALENTS\, LES SYNAPSES\, DUTRONC\, CECILIA UND DIE SAUERKRAUTS & OPERATION S goes back to the sound of the French Beat & Roll when it was bitten by the Big Bad British Bug back in 1965. Imagine how THEM\, THE SMALL FACES\, THE YARDBIRDS or the early STONES would've sound if they were from France\, never turned professionals and Van Morrison\, Keith Relf or Mike Jagger were chicks. All the songs are in French\, with that glamorous 'mademoiselle' accent! The band could've been described best as the great french sixties rock band that should have existed but never did. Owing to cultural impediments and lame business practices\, there were very few outstanding french rockers from that period. Ronnie Bird\, Larry Greco\, and a dozen others you've never heard of: LES TERRIBLES cover them all\, and every song makes you wanna dance. The band rounds out their set with some originals\, as well as their own french versions of some great foreign songs that never got adapted before\, all done with a perfect ear for the style. Fronted by the charming and talented chanteuse Rudie this hard-working orchestre delivers the groove that gets the dance floor moving to the Swim\, the Jerk\, and the Hully-Gully. Les Terribles are sur scene ! ((Jon Dragueur) A Top 10 forever-must have this one is. What more can we tell you? COL channel name VAL Matthew East	0

COL title VAL Standing on the Corner COL performer VAL Dean Martin	COL video title VAL Cliff Richard - We Don't Talk Anymore (1979) COL description VAL Britain's answer to Elvis Presley\, Richard (born Harry Webb) dominated the pre-Beatles British pop scene in the late '50s and early '60s. An accomplished singer with a genuine feel for the music\, Richard's artistic legacy is nonetheless meager\, as he was quickly steered toward a middle-of-the-road pop direction. Several of his late-'50s recordings\, however\, were genuinely exciting Presley-esque rockers -- especially his first hit\, "Move It" (1958) -- and gave British teenagers their first taste of genuine homegrown rock & roll talent. Backed by the Shadows -- clean-cut instrumental virtuosos who became legends of their own -- Richard embarked on a truly awesome string of hit singles in Britain\, scoring no less than 43 Top 20 hits between 1958 and 1969. One of these\, although it was by no means one of the more successful\, was an actual Mick Jagger/Keith Richards composition (the ballad "Blue Turns to Grey").  In his homeland\, Richard's popularity was diminished only slightly by the rise of the Beatles\, but in his prime\, he had a much rougher time in the U.S.\, hitting the Top 40 only three times (with "Living Doll" in 1959\, "It's All in the Game" in 1963\, and "Devil Woman" in 1976). Richard belatedly cracked the U.S. Top Ten in 1976 with "Devil Woman\," and racked up a few other hits ("We Don't Talk Anymore\," "Dreaming\," "A Little in Love") in a mainstream pop/rock style. He remains an institution in Britain\, where he is one of the nation's most popular all-around entertainers of all time. ~ Richie Unterberger\, All Music Guide _____________________________________ In 2008\, Richard's 50th year in music\, will see the release of the 8CD box set\, And They Said It Wouldn't Last (My 50 Years In Music). In September\, a single celebrating his 50 years in pop music\, titled * Thank you for a Lifetime has been released. On the 14th of September 2008 Thank You For A Lifetime reached No.3 on the UK music charts\, which gives Cliff a Top 3 hit in each of his six decades as a singer. On 2nd November 2008\, British newspaper The Mail on Sunday gave away a free promotional CD entitled '50th Anniversary' containing 12 tracks picked by Sir Cliff himself.

Some day you'll return to  Your valleys and your farms  And you'll no longer burn  To be brothers in arms.    Through these fields of destruction  Baptism of fire  I've witnessed your suffering  As the battle raged higher.  And though they did hurt me so bad  In my fear and alarm  You did not desert me  My brothers in arms.    There's so many different worlds  So many different suns  And we have just one world  But we live in different ones.    Now the sun's gone to hell  And the moon's riding high  Let me bid you farewell  Every man has to die.  But it's written in the starlight  And every line in your palm  We're fools to make war  On our brothers in arms... COL channel name VAL UFCHeadhunter	0

They later teamed in the late 80's to write a successful AIDS musical called "Elegies for Angels\, Punks and Raging Queens." It was good enough that there have been three cast recordings of it released.

'Spirit of '73: Rock For Choice' was put together by the activist group Feminist Majority with proceeds going to support the Becky Bell/Rosie Jimenez Campaign "to lift consent laws and federal funding restrictions that are forcing young women to turn to back-alley abortions". The compilation's title is inspired by the January 22\, 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion in the United States. The songs included are all contemporary artists of 1995 covering songs that were popular in the early 1970s.   Fun Fact: The producer of the original "Midnight At The Oasis" by Maria Muldaur was none other than That Dog singer/guitarist Anna Waronker's father\, Lenny Waronker.

COL title VAL The Wedding of the Painted Doll COL performer VAL Frankie Carle	COL video title VAL Randy California / Kapt. Kopter &  The (Fabulous) Twirly Birds - Mother And Child Reunion COL description VAL Randy California (наст. имя Randy Craig Wolfe; Лос-Анджелес\, 20 февраля 1951 - 2 января 1997) был гитарист\, вокалист и автор песен рок-группы Spirit\, созданной в 1967 году. Входит в список "100 лучших гитаристов мира" по версии журнала Classic Rock. Сценический псевдоним "Рэнди Калифорния" дал ему (в 15 лет) Джими Хендрикс\, чтобы можно было отличить от другого Рэнди в тогдашней группе Хендрикса Jimmy James and the Blue Flames (второго Рэнди Хендрикс называл "Рэнди Техас"). После ухода из группы Spirit (июль 1971) Рэнди начал сольную карьеру\, подписал контракт с Epic и выпустил осенью 1972 года альбом Kapt. Kopter and the (Fabulous) Twirly Birds. Музыка - Хендриксо-подобная\, с импровизациями\, кроме того здесь на некоторых треках играет басист Noel Redding (ex-Jimi Hendrix Experience). Следует отметить\, что на этой пластинке некоторые известные музыканты записаны под псевдонимами. С Эдом Кэссиди (своим отчимом) и басистом Ларри Найтом (Larry «Fuzzy» Knight) он провёл в Европе гастроли в поддержку своей пластинки. Но не совсем удачные\, так как Калифорния оказался неважным промоутером... Трио\, кроме того\, подготовило концептуальный альбом Potatoland\, но лейбл его отверг и Калифорния на некоторое время ушёл из музыкального бизнеса\, поселившись на Гавайях.

COL title VAL Honey COL performer VAL Sonny James	COL video title VAL Average White Band ~ If I Ever Lose This Heaven "1975" Funk COL description VAL Their self-effacing name to the contrary\, Average White Band was anything but -- one of the few white groups to cross the color line and achieve success and credibility playing funk\, with their tight\, fiery sound also belying their Scottish heritage\, evoking American R&B hotbeds like Detroit\, Memphis\, and Philadelphia instead. Singer/bassist Alan Gorrie\, guitarists Hamish Stuart and Onnie McIntyre\, tenor saxophonist Malcolm Duncan\, keyboardist/saxophonist Roger Ball\, and drummer Robbie McIntosh comprised the original Average White Band lineup. Veterans of numerous Scottish soul and jazz groups\, they made their debut in 1973 as the opening act at Eric Clapton's Rainbow Theatre comeback gig\, soon issuing their debut LP\, Show Your Hand\, to little notice. After adopting the abbreviated moniker AWB\, a year later the band issued their self-titled sophomore effort\, topping the American pop charts with the Arif Mardin-produced instrumental "Pick Up the Pieces." The record's mammoth success was nevertheless tempered by the September 23\, 1974 death of McIntosh\, who died at a Hollywood party after overdosing on heroin.  Cut the Cake Ex-Bloodstone drummer Steve Ferrone replaced McIntosh for AWB's third album\, 1975's Cut the Cake\, which scored a Top Ten hit with its title track as well as two other chart entries\, "If I Ever Lose This Heaven" and "School Boy Crush." (Put It Where You Want It\, issued later that same year\, was simply a retitled and repackaged Show Your Hand.) With 1976's Soul Searching\, the group reclaimed the full Average White Band name\, scoring their final Top 40 hit with "Queen of My Soul." Following the live Person to Person\, they issued Benny & Us\, a collaboration with soul legend Ben E. King. However\, after subsequent outings\, including 1978's Warmer Communications\, 1979's Feel No Fret\, and 1980's Shine\, failed to recapture the energy of AWB's peak\, the group dissolved in 1982\, with Ferrone later joining Duran Duran and Stuart recording with Paul McCartney. Gorrie\, Ball\, and McIntyre reformed Average White Band in 1989\, tapping vocalist Alex Ligertwood for their comeback effort Aftershock. Oft-sampled by hip-hop producers throughout the 1990s\, the group continued touring prior to releasing Soul Tattoo in 1996. The live album\, Face to Face\, followed three years later.

It was released as a single and peaked at number 29 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart and number 1 on the Billboard Top Tracks chart. The song was Gabriel's first Top 40 hit in the US. In the UK\, the song charted at number 58. It was included on Gabriel's fourth self-titled album\, issued in the U.S. as Security. As well as its "relentlessly repeated hook" that "sounded nothing like anything else on the radio at the time"\, the track is known for its popular and somewhat disturbing music video featuring Gabriel (in white face paint) and a frightened-looking capuchin monkey.  Interpretation  Due to its title and the content of the video\, the song is frequently assumed to be either an animal rights song or a reference to the famous experiments by Stanley Milgram described in his book Obedience to Authority. It is neither\, although another Gabriel song\, "We Do What We're Told (Milgram's 37)"\, from his 1986 album So\, does deal directly with Milgram. Gabriel himself has described "Shock the Monkey" as "a love song" that examines how jealousy can release one's baser instincts; the monkey is not a literal monkey\, but a metaphor for one's feelings of jealousy.  Releases  "Shock the Monkey" was released as a 7" picture disc in addition to the 7" and 12" black vinyl singles. Club DJ remix service Hot Tracks crafted an 8:12 version that intersperses verses and choruses sung by Gabriel in German with the more familiar English lyrics. A concert version of the song appears on Gabriel's album Plays Live (1983). It is also included on the compilation albums Shaking the Tree (1990) and Hit (2003). The music video appears on the DVD compilation Play (2004).  Remix contest  An online contest was held in September 2006 by Realworld Remixed in which musicians and engineers were invited to submit a remix of the song. The original tracks were made available for download\, offering a rare opportunity to work with the raw material from a hit song. The winner was Multiman's "Simian Surprise".  Coal Chamber feat. Ozzy Osbourne version  The alternative metal band Coal Chamber covered "Shock the Monkey" on their 1999 album Chamber Music. The cover featured guest vocals by Ozzy Osbourne.  Music video  Directed by Dean Karr. It shows the band playing with Ozzy and it has shots of a Monkey.  Other cover versions  Hawaiian recording artist Don Ho covered "Shock the Monkey" on the 2002 compilation album When Pigs Fly: Songs You Never Thought You'd Hear.  Finnish metal band Suburban Tribe covered "Shock the Monkey" on their 2007 album Recollection.  The Vitamin String Quartet featured the song on their Peter Gabriel tribute album  Use in other media  "Shock the Monkey" is included in the opening sequence to the film\, Project X.  The song is used in the South Park episode "Raisins". After Wendy breaks up with Stan\, he asks Wendy's friend Bebe how to win her back. She tells Stan to "stand outside her window\, and play Peter Gabriel" (a reference to Lloyd Dobler's actions in the movie Say Anything)\, so he chooses this song to play on the boombox.

COL title VAL Blues Before Sunrise COL performer VAL John Lee Hooker	COL video title VAL Open the Door\, Richard (#1 hit version) - The Three Flames COL description VAL Another version of "Open the Door Richard" by the Three Flames. A very popular late 1940's vocal group. They hosted their own TV show on NBC in 1949. One of only two #1 versions of "Open the Door Richard" it charted Feb. 1947. I'm adding this to clear up some misinformation about this song....  Clinton "Dusty" Fletcher was an African-American vaudeville performer. He created the "Open The Door Richard" routine. It was Jack McVea who put the routine to music and recorded it. It became a huge hit in the late 1940s and was covered by many different bands. Dusty Fletcher even released his own two sided disc of it. COL channel name VAL geofbrit59	0

Link below COL description VAL https://youtu.be/gVrCs58PNUU This is a much better HD copy of the music\, plus Stay a Little Longer.  Westenr Swing music from the 1940s.  This has Noel Boggs on Steel\, which means after the war probably 1946. Alex Beshear on trumpet plays it without a mute.  That was quite unusual for him.  Also Tommy sings it.  When Bob made the Okey 78\, the vocalist was Danny Alguire\, who also played trumpet.  Tommy had joined the army when that session took play. So here we get to hear the way he would have done it.  Just wish the quality was better.  Notice the accordian?  Bob never used one in his recordings\, and I have to wonder where Noel plugged in his steel guitar.  Behind a tree?  Hot session\, though.

COL title VAL Another Girl\, Another Planet COL performer VAL The Lightning Seeds	COL video title VAL The Coal Porters - Another Girl\, Another Planet (live) COL description VAL The Coal Porters play Another Girl Another Planet live in Wales\, 2014.  Another Girl Another Planet is featured on The Coal Porters new album\, No. 6. No. 6\, is produced by John Wood\, the legendary British folk-rock mastermind who recorded the classic albums of Fairport Convention\, Nick Drake\, Beth Orton and Squeeze. No. 6 is a bit of a departure for the Coal Porters as it pushes their musical boundaries further than ever before.The Coal Porters - No. 6  https://thecoalporters.com / https://thecoalporters.bandcamp.com / https://www.facebook.com/thecoalporters  This new album features Kerenza quadruple tracking herself into a string quartet\, Andrew on a ukulele\, Sid on trusty autoharp and mandolin\, both Neil and Paul on dobro\, a Byrdsy acoustic 12-string guitar\, and very emotional\, long\, sweet trumpet solo by Cuba’s noted “son y mambo” music virtuoso Eikel Venegas. There has never been music like this before. And already\, the album’s opening track\, Sid’s “The Day The Last Ramone Died\,” is being hailed as a classic.  Recorded in two creative bursts in late 2014 and in 2015 this is the Coal Porters album which took three years to incubate. Four new Sid songs\, three new Neil Bob Herd originals\, and Kerenza Peacock contributed her first recorded lead vocal on a very personal song with Play A Tune while also gracing the record with a totally catchy instrumental\, Chopping The Garlic. The album goes out on a high note with the band’s warm-hearted cover of the Only Ones’ classic hit Another Girl\, Another Planet.  No.6 was released in September 2016 and can be ordered via Amazon\, iTunes\, the Sid Griffin website and in all good records stores.  Read more about No. 6 at http://www.sidgriffin.com/2016/09/06/the-coal-porters-no-6/  The Coal Porters are also on facebook at http://www.facebook.com/The-Coal-Porters COL channel name VAL The Coal Porters	1

Sammen skal vi leve hver søster og hver bror\, små barn av regnbuen og en frodig jord.  Noen tror det ikke nytter\, noen kaster tiden bort med prat\, noen tror visst vi kan leve av plast og syntetisk mat\, og noen stjeler fra de unge som blir sendt ut for å slåss\, noen stjeler fra de mange som kommer etter oss.  En himmel full av stjerner\, blått hav så langt du ser\, en jord der blomster gror\, kan du ønske mer?  Sammen skal vi leve hver søster og hver bror\, små barn av regnbuen og en frodig jord.  Men si det til alle barna\, og si det til hver far og mor; Dette er vår siste sjanse til å dele et håp og en jord.  En himmel full av stjerner\, blått hav så langt du ser\, en jord der blomster gror\, kan du ønske mer?  Sammen skal vi leve hver søster og hver bror\, små barn av regnbuen og en frodig jord.  En himmel full av stjerner\, blått hav så langt du ser\, en jord der blomster gror\, kan du ønske mer?  Original av Pete Seeger\, norsk versjon skrevet for albumet "Portrett" fra 1973.

You Got It Coming (Supertonic Remix)  ------------------------  "R.A.M.O.N.E.S." is a song first recorded by the British rock band Motörhead on their 1991 album 1916 as a tribute to their friends and contemporaries\, the Ramones. The bands were long-standing admirers of each other's work. Critic Andy Boot\, reviewing the album in Kerrang (27 February 1991) described the song as "the icing on a very fine\, if somewhat heavy\, cake."  "It was the ultimate honor - like John Lennon writing a song for you". -Joey Ramone  The track was first aired before Phil Taylor and Würzel left the band and has continued as a live staple.  Cover versions  It also appears as a bonus track on the album Fang Bang by Wednesday 13.  The Ramones also performed it on and off until their final show in August 1996 at which C.J. Ramone and Lemmy shared lead vocals. Two different studio versions were recorded. One appears as a bonus track on their album ¡Adios Amigos! with C.J. Ramone singing lead vocals and the other one on the Greatest Hits Live with Joey Ramone singing lead vocals.  The Huntingtons also covered this song on their File Under Ramones album.  "R.A.M.O.N.E.S." was also covered by the Offspring on their performance at Rock in Rio 5 on September 14\, 2013. At that show\, Marky Ramone (who was the drummer of the Ramones from 1978 to 1983\, and again from 1987 to their breakup in 1996) joined them onstage to perform cover versions of "R.A.M.O.N.E.S." and "California Sun".  ------------------------  Lyrics  New York City\, N.Y.C.

COL title VAL Hot Burrito No. 1 COL performer VAL Raul Malo	COL video title VAL ELLIE POP - WHATCHA GONNA DO ABOUT IT.wmv COL description VAL ELLIE POP - 'Watcha Gonna Do 'Bout It' (Mainstream S-6115) 1968  Before I started collecting original 60s garage/psych 45s I spent decades buying (mostly) original and re-issue albums and one of my early purchases was this obscurity by Ellie Pop on Mainstream Records. This album is hard to find and commands a decent price tag but it was re-issued a few years ago and should now be available to a larger audience at last.  In my opinion Ellie Pop were treading their own path in 1968\, there's no fuzz\, no psych touches\, no 1968isms of heavy guitars and keyboards. What you get is a collection of beautifully constructed pop songs that suggest a big Anglophile influence\, in particular mid-60s period Beatles. They sound similar to say The Merry-Go-Round or The Left Banke but without the baroque touches. Just pure pop\, or should I say Ellie Pop.  Virtually every review I've read online or in Shindig for instance\, fails to mention that 'Whatcha Gonna Do 'Bout It' is a cover of a Hollies cut they recorded in 1963 for their debut album 'Stay With The Hollies.' Ellie Pop wrote all of their own tunes except this one!  I'm not certain where Ellie Pop hailed from or even the full names of the group members but it has been suggested elsewhere that they were from Detroit. Maybe someone can confirm this?  http://expo67-cavestones.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/ellie-pop-whatcha-gonna-do-bout-it.html COL channel name VAL ACID REVOLVER	0

COL title VAL That's How Heartaches Are Made COL performer VAL Baby Washington	COL video title VAL Walker Brothers :::: Pretty Girls Everywhere. COL description VAL The Walker Brothers were an American pop group of the 1960s and 1970s\, comprising Scott Engel (eventually known professionally as Scott Walker)\, John Walker (born John Maus\, but using the name Walker since his teens)\, and Gary Leeds (eventually known as Gary Walker). After moving to Britain in 1965\, they had a number of top ten albums and singles there\, including the No. 1 chart hits "Make It Easy on Yourself" and "The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine (Anymore)\," both of which also made the US top 20.  Formed in 1964\, they adopted the 'Walker Brothers' name even though the members are all unrelated as a show business touch—"simply because we liked it." They provided a unique counterpoint to the British Invasion in that they were a group from the United States that achieved much more success in the United Kingdom than in their home country\, during the period when the popularity of British bands such as The Beatles dominated the US.

COL title VAL Halloween COL performer VAL Alkaline Trio	COL video title VAL Bob Thompson - June is bustin' out all over COL description VAL Bob Thompson (b. 1924\, San Jose\, California) was a composer\, arranger\, and orchestra leader from the 1950s through the 1980s. Active in Los Angeles\, Thompson was a recording artist for RCA Victor\, scored film and television soundtracks\, and wrote commercial jingles. Thompson is considered a prime exponent of what has belatedly been termed "Space age pop\," or "Space Age Bachelor Pad Music." This style of breezy\, experimental orchestral music became popular in the 1950s and 1960s following the introduction of the long-playing microgroove record and the advent of high-fidelity and stereo home audio systems\, which allowed enhanced sonic reproduction.

(don't confuse  with many other compilations\, they has another 1996 re-recorded version)  NO JIVE is ABSOLUTELY THE BEST COMPILATION ABOUT JOSE FELICIANO 2 CD with his hit and many rarities never released before and many intrumentals  The song is also famous in the cover by George Benson in his hit album "Breezin" from 1976 and recently sampled by DJ Nujabes in Counting Stars part of the Samurai Champloo line up as "Shino's Theme" Video isn't of the.... Vinyl Version!!  here the story "How George Benson covered Affirmation by Jose Feliciano" by his producer LiPuma  A review by '70s for Breezin LP  Though Side One of Breezin' had the hits\, Side Two was a creamy\, seamless masterpiece unto itself. It unfolded with "Affirmation\," a song composed by Jose Feliciano\, the international superstar singer/guitarist/composer who had recorded it on his album\, Just Wanna Rock 'N' Roll (RCA)\, from the fall of '75. "Affirmation" was the sole instrumental on that Feliciano LP\, providing the blind Puerto Rican wunderkind a golden opportunity to showcase his skills on acoustic Spanish guitar\, electric rhythm guitar (with a wah-wah effect)\, electric bass\, congas and as a string arranger! LiPuma was enchanted with the melody of Feliciano's relatively brief (3:33) recording. When material was being prepared for Breezin'\, he presented it to Benson\, who liked it immediately. The band worked up an arrangement that loosened and elongated the vibe of the original. Like Feliciano's version\, George begins "Affirmation" alone\, caressing an introduction of choice notes and a smooth rendering of its signature run down the frets. But when the rhythm section eases in\, led by MacDonald's congas\, the groove is more relaxed and funky in a way that is quite different from Feliciano's more insistent arrangement\, which throbbed with forthright Latin pride. Where Feliciano had his rhythm section drop out for the soaring bridge\, Benson's band rides it like the wind\, drummer Mason liberating the rhythm by opening up on his cymbals. Benson tickles the strings with a tasty solo that leads into the killer breakdown section\, with Upchurch dipping into his effects bag. And then\, in what has to be one of the all-time classiest hand-offs in music\, Benson makes way for Dalto's wistful electric piano (complete with soulful little comps) before Benson takes it home\, getting in a few final signature licks. Benson's "Affirmation" is seven minutes of masterful musical heaven. http://www.fantasticfeliciano.too.it/ COL channel name VAL Thevolumex	0

Lulu Gainsbourg\, acaba de sacar  el disco (si no me equivoco es el primero) From Gainsbourg to Lulu y fue sobre lo seguro: un disco homenaje a su padre\, es decir desde el principio hasta el final con grandes canciones\, y como si esto no bastara\, con numerosos y conocidísimos  (tanto del cine como de la música) invitados.

COL title VAL Steppin' Out COL performer VAL Claire Martin & Richard Rodney Bennett	COL video title VAL LURLEAN HUNTER  Vocal Jazz Swing. Steppin' Out With My Baby \, I Feel COL description VAL Lurlean Hunter  Singer Lurlean Hunter made five albums on her own during the second half of the '50s\, starting out as a Lonesome Gal on RCA and winding up still feeling Blue & Sentimental for Atlantic. She was discovered in Chicago where she had been singing in many clubs\, including a collaboration with drummer Red Saunders that held forth at the Club DeLisa. Hunter's move to New York City in 1955 was prompted by RCA's interest in recording her. The singer's recording career actually began before she left the Windy City at the behest of indie jazz labels\, some of them quite short-lived -- such as Seymour\, with a catalog topping out at four releases. The press described Hunter as a "blues thrush" in announcing her interpretations of three numbers actually written by the label's owner\, producer and record store owner Seymour Schwartz. The latter promotional blurb inevitably told some truth about Hunter's stylistic traits\, if not her relation to winged fauna. Her recordings were more about rhythm & blues and pop than jazz\, yet were done in an era when such sessions often involved fine mainstream jazz players in the accompaniment. The 1956Night Life\, for example\, featured pianist Hank Jones and tenor saxophonist Al Cohn. Blue & Sentimental -- with arrangements by the progressive Jimmy Giuffre -- was reissued in 2000 as a split CD also including an album by fellow singer Betty Bennett\, a former wife of pianist André Previn.Hunter's final recordings were done in 1964\, at which point she was still well under 40 years old. She is known to have died young\, although details of this tragedy are murky. In one version of the story she was knocked off by a mobster lover\, yet whether anybody was really that mean to Lurlean cannot be completely confirmed.

COL title VAL Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey COL performer VAL Paul & Linda McCartney	COL video title VAL Walker Brothers :::: Pretty Girls Everywhere. COL description VAL The Walker Brothers were an American pop group of the 1960s and 1970s\, comprising Scott Engel (eventually known professionally as Scott Walker)\, John Walker (born John Maus\, but using the name Walker since his teens)\, and Gary Leeds (eventually known as Gary Walker). After moving to Britain in 1965\, they had a number of top ten albums and singles there\, including the No. 1 chart hits "Make It Easy on Yourself" and "The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine (Anymore)\," both of which also made the US top 20.  Formed in 1964\, they adopted the 'Walker Brothers' name even though the members are all unrelated as a show business touch—"simply because we liked it." They provided a unique counterpoint to the British Invasion in that they were a group from the United States that achieved much more success in the United Kingdom than in their home country\, during the period when the popularity of British bands such as The Beatles dominated the US.

It is Holland (and not Kim Weston in 1965) who did the first recording of "Take me in Your Arms (Rock Me a Little While)" in 1964 but it was not released commercially until 2005\, even though Weston's cover was the first commercial release. Listen and compare how Weston's cover is almost similar to Holland's original version here.   http://fr.youtube.com/watch?v=h4SEm44Ee8A&feature=related  The better known version that people most remember is the Doobie Brothers' cover in 1975 which went up to number 11 on the Billboard Charts that year.

COL title VAL Sabbath Bloody Sabbath COL performer VAL Belphegor	COL video title VAL Average White Band ~ If I Ever Lose This Heaven "1975" Funk COL description VAL Their self-effacing name to the contrary\, Average White Band was anything but -- one of the few white groups to cross the color line and achieve success and credibility playing funk\, with their tight\, fiery sound also belying their Scottish heritage\, evoking American R&B hotbeds like Detroit\, Memphis\, and Philadelphia instead. Singer/bassist Alan Gorrie\, guitarists Hamish Stuart and Onnie McIntyre\, tenor saxophonist Malcolm Duncan\, keyboardist/saxophonist Roger Ball\, and drummer Robbie McIntosh comprised the original Average White Band lineup. Veterans of numerous Scottish soul and jazz groups\, they made their debut in 1973 as the opening act at Eric Clapton's Rainbow Theatre comeback gig\, soon issuing their debut LP\, Show Your Hand\, to little notice. After adopting the abbreviated moniker AWB\, a year later the band issued their self-titled sophomore effort\, topping the American pop charts with the Arif Mardin-produced instrumental "Pick Up the Pieces." The record's mammoth success was nevertheless tempered by the September 23\, 1974 death of McIntosh\, who died at a Hollywood party after overdosing on heroin.  Cut the Cake Ex-Bloodstone drummer Steve Ferrone replaced McIntosh for AWB's third album\, 1975's Cut the Cake\, which scored a Top Ten hit with its title track as well as two other chart entries\, "If I Ever Lose This Heaven" and "School Boy Crush." (Put It Where You Want It\, issued later that same year\, was simply a retitled and repackaged Show Your Hand.) With 1976's Soul Searching\, the group reclaimed the full Average White Band name\, scoring their final Top 40 hit with "Queen of My Soul." Following the live Person to Person\, they issued Benny & Us\, a collaboration with soul legend Ben E. King. However\, after subsequent outings\, including 1978's Warmer Communications\, 1979's Feel No Fret\, and 1980's Shine\, failed to recapture the energy of AWB's peak\, the group dissolved in 1982\, with Ferrone later joining Duran Duran and Stuart recording with Paul McCartney. Gorrie\, Ball\, and McIntyre reformed Average White Band in 1989\, tapping vocalist Alex Ligertwood for their comeback effort Aftershock. Oft-sampled by hip-hop producers throughout the 1990s\, the group continued touring prior to releasing Soul Tattoo in 1996. The live album\, Face to Face\, followed three years later.

The record was released in June 1979 on Optional Music with "The Man with the Dogs" as the b-side. The title track was re-recorded for the band's first album\, Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables (1980)\, and the version that appeared on this single\, as well as the single's b-side\, are available on the rarities album Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death (1987).  The lyrics were written by Jello Biafra and John Greenway\, and Biafra composed the music in one of his rare attempts at composing on bass.  This song was featured in the video game Tony Hawk's American Wasteland and as a downloadable song in the Rock Band series. It is also sampled in a song by the dance-punk/big beat trio The Prodigy\, "Dead Ken Beats". The song was also featured in the 2010 film The Social Network.  Meaning  The title is an allusion to the first (and no longer sung) stanza of the national anthem of Germany\, which begins with the words "Deutschland\, Deutschland über alles." (literally\, "Germany\, Germany above all.")  The song focuses on Jerry Brown\, the Governor of California 1975-1983 and 2011--present\, and is sung from his perspective. An imaginary Brown outlines a hippie-fascist vision for America\, in which his "suede denim secret police" kill un-cool people with "organic poison gas" chambers. Lines such as "Serpent's egg already hatched" (a reference to a line from William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar) comment on the corrosive nature of power. The line "now it is 1984" refers to the totalitarian regime of George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four\, describing a future (from 1979) where Jerry Brown has become President Brown presiding over secret police and gas chambers.  Cover versions  Blue Ribbon Glee Club regularly perform their version of the song.  The song was updated by The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy when they released a cover version in 1992 on the album Hypocrisy is the Greatest Legacy. They replaced references to Jerry Brown with references to Pete Wilson.  The song was also widely known in Poland (as "Kalifornia Ponad Wszystko") thanks to the cover by Polish rocker Kazik Staszewski with his band Kazik Na Żywo.  Hasidic New Wave perform a remake of the song on their 1999 album\, Kabalogy. In their version\, titled "Giuliani Über Alles"\, Jerry Brown is replaced by former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani.  The Delgados cover the song in their Peel Sessions CD set.  Six Feet Under do a cover the song on their Graveyard Classics album.  The black metal band Mayhem also covered the song.  Deceased covered the song on their punk covers album Rotten to the Core.  The hardcore band Ceremony has covered the song.  The Who Boys have done a mashup of "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" by Gil Scott-Heron called "Revolution Über Alles".  John Linnell and his band The Statesmen covered it live at least once during his "State Songs" tour\, choosing to perform it because it mentioned the state of California.  Dramarama has recorded a version\, updated in 2003 about California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger... "You will lift weights in school".  A 1986 live recording focused on Ronald Reagan on the album Mutiny On The Bay with live recordings from 1982 and 1986.  Jayne County covered the song with She Wolves about California's Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The green vinyl single was released under artist name Jayne County Meets The She Wolves by the German label Trash 2001.  Mexican death metal band Brujería covers Dead Kennedys with the song "California Uber Aztlan" in 2010. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0
COL title VAL Sixteen Going on Seventeen COL performer VAL Daniel Truhitte and Charmian Carr	COL video title VAL Elly Lapp - Ich weiß es wird einmal ein Wunder gescheh'n COL description VAL Elly Lapp Ganz nah  Genre: Deutsch-Pop\, Chanson\, Schlager   „Eine Stimme die unter die Haut geht.  Eindringlich\, lasziv\, ganz nah."   Elly Lapp liebt die Brückenschläge. Für sie sind UFA-Schlager und Popmusik keine  unarrangierbaren Gegensätze\, sondern interpretatorische Herausforderung. Dabei ist eine sehr moderne CD entstanden\,  die gleichzeitig sehr intensiv und sehr persönlich ist. Viel näher geht`s nicht.   Es waren große Songs -- es sind große Songs. Dazu leistet eine interessante Interpretin ihren Beitrag. Elly Lapp. Die studierte Schauspielerin und Sängerin tourt mit eigenen Programmen durch Deutschland -- und sie war die Stimme des Titelsongs der erfolgreichen ARD-Fernsehserie „Kir Royal".  „Der Wind hat mir ein Lied erzählt" - gleichzeitig erste Single - und „Ich steh` im Regen" sind Versuche einer ungewöhnlichen Verbindung von UFA - HIT und POPSOUND. Zarah Leander machte einst diese Songs zu Welterfolgen. Damals hatten die Autoren wohl nie eine Umsetzung mit rockigen Gitarren oder Saxophon im Auge. Hier geben die modernen Instrumente\, wie das gesamte Pop- Arrangement\, eine ganz neue Farbe -- voller Intensität.  Doch die CD von Elly Lapp zeigt die großen Filmhits nicht nur im Popgewand\, sondern auch sehr sparsam\, kunstvoll arrangiert\, als Chansons mit großer interpretatorischer Tiefe.  z.B." Wenn ich mir was wünschen dürfte" und - vor allem - „Der Nowack lässt mich nicht verkommen" -\, ein wahrer Kultsong\, 1959 geschrieben\, sofort auf Schallplatte aufgenommen\, kurzerhand von einem Münchner Gericht verboten und wieder eingestampft -- eine echte Rarität für jedes Rundfunk- und Privatarchiv!

Stan Kelly  Lyrics: Oh you are a mucky kid\, Dirty as a dustbin lid. When he hears the things you did\, You'll gerra belt from your Dad. Oh you have your father's nose\, So crimson in the dark it glows\, If you're not asleep when the boozers close\, You'll gerra belt from your Dad.   You look so scruffy lying dur Strawberry-jam tats in yer 'air\, Though in the world you haven't a care And I have got so many. It's quite a struggle every day Living on your father's pay\, The bugger drinks it all away And leaves me without any.   Although we have no silver spoon\, Better days are coming soon Now Nelly's working at the Lune And she gets paid on Friday. Perhaps one day we'll have a splash\, When Littlewoods provide the cash\, We'll get a house in Knotty Ash And buy your Dad a brewery.   Oh you are a mucky kid\, Dirty as a dustbin lid. When he hears the things you did You'll gerra belt from your Dad. Oh you have your father's face\, You're growing up a real hard case\, But there's no one can take your place\, .... Go fast asleep for yer Mammy. COL channel name VAL DecemberedCorpInc	0

The album was recorded through the hurricanes Gustav\, Hannah and Ike. Sometimes there wasn't enough power for the lights so they had to record by candle light which certainly added to the atmosphere!

COL title VAL I Call Your Name COL performer VAL The Mama's and The Papa's	COL video title VAL A Love Supreme\, Part 1: Acknowledgement - John Coltrane (1965) COL description VAL "Part 1: Acknowledgement" was the first track on "A Love Supreme"\, a jazz studio album recorded by John Coltrane's classic quartet in December 1964 and released by Impulse! Records in February 1965.  It is generally considered to be among Coltrane's greatest works\, as it melded the hard bop sensibilities of his early career with the free jazz style he adopted later.  The quartet recorded the album in one session on December 9\, 1964\, at the Van Gelder Studio in Englewood Cliffs\, New Jersey.  The album is a four-part suite\, broken up into tracks: "Acknowledgement" (which contains the mantra that gave the suite its name)\, "Resolution"\, "Pursuance"\, and "Psalm".  It is intended to be a spiritual album\, broadly representative of a personal struggle for purity\, and expresses Coltrane's deep gratitude as he admits to his talent and instrument as being owned not by him but by a spiritual higher power.  The track begins the album with the bang of a gong\, or tam-tam\, followed by cymbal washes.  Jimmy Garrison follows on bass with the four-note motif which structures the entire movement\, after which Coltrane's solo follows.  Besides soloing upon variations of the motif\, at one point Coltrane repeats the four notes over and over in different modulations.  After many repetitions\, the motif becomes the vocal chant "A Love Supreme"\, sung by Coltrane\, accompanying himself via overdubs.  "A Love Supreme" is often listed amongst the greatest jazz albums of all time.  It was also quite popular for a jazz album\, selling about 500\,000 copies by 1970\, a number far exceeding Coltrane's typical Impulse! sales of around 30\,000.  As further testimony to the recording's historic significance\, the manuscript for the album is one of the National Museum of American History's 'Treasures of American History'\, part of the collection of the Smithsonian Institution.  The Penguin Guide to Jazz selected this album as part of its suggested 'Core Collection'\, stating "It is without precedent and parallel\, and though it must also be one of the best-loved jazz records of all time it somehow remains remote from critical pigeonholing" calling it "immensely concentrated and rich."  The album's influence has been extensive and diverse.  Musicians ranging from tenor Joshua Redman to the singer Bono of U2 have singled out the influence of the album on their own work.  Guitarists John McLaughlin and Carlos Santana have each credited the album as one of their greatest early influences.  John William Coltrane\, sometimes abbreviated 'Trane' (September 23\, 1926 -- July 17\, 1967)\, was an American jazz saxophonist and composer. He was beatified by the African Orthodox Church as Saint John William Coltrane.  Working in the bebop and hard bop idioms early in his career\, Coltrane helped pioneer the use of modes in jazz and later was at the forefront of free jazz.  He was prolific\, organizing at least fifty recording sessions as a leader during his recording career\, and appeared as a sideman on many other albums\, notably with trumpeter Miles Davis and pianist Thelonious Monk.  As his career progressed\, his music took on an increasingly spiritual dimension.  He influenced innumerable musicians\, and remains one of the most significant tenor saxophonists in jazz history.  Coltrane died from liver cancer at Huntington Hospital on Long Island on July 17\, 1967\, at the age of 40.  This channel is dedicated to the classic jazz music you've loved for years.

COL title VAL A Strange Way to Save the World COL performer VAL Jump5	COL video title VAL Nine Below Zero - Sonny Boy Williamson (Trumpet) COL description VAL Recorded on December 4\, 1951. Williamson's first recording session took place in 1951 for Lillian McMurry of Jackson\, Mississippi's Trumpet Records\, three years after the death of John Lee Williamson\, which for the first time allowed some legitimacy to Miller's carefully worded claim to being "the one and only Sonny Boy Williamson". McMurry later erected Williamson's headstone\, near Tutwiler\, Mississippi\, in 1977. Checker Records When Trumpet went bankrupt in 1955\, Sonny Boy's recording contract was yielded to its creditors\, who sold it to Chess Records in Chicago\, Illinois. Sonny Boy had begun developing a following in Chicago beginning in 1953\, when he appeared there as a member of Elmore James's band. It was during his Chess years that he enjoyed his greatest success and acclaim\, recording about 70 songs for Chess subsidiary Checker Records from 1955 to 1964. Sonny Boy's first LP record was titled Down and Out Blues and was released by Checker Records in 1959. Ace Records One single\, "Boppin' With Sonny" b/w "No Nights By Myself" was released with Ace Records in 1955.

By the way\, the lp was produced by Mike Post\, and most of the songs were written/cowritten by him. Good stuff all around and available pretty cheap on ebay.

COL title VAL Step Inside Love COL performer VAL Cilla Black	COL video title VAL Joanie Sommers – “Step Inside Love” (Happy Tiger) 1968 COL description VAL Written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Arranged by  Capps and produced by Joseph Porter.  Joanie\, who scored a #7 US hit with “Johnny Get Angry” in the summer of 1962\, didn’t return to Hot-100 after “When The Boys Get Together” charted in October of the same year.  Some great records followed on Warners\, however\, including the northern soul favorite\, “Don’t Pity Me” in 1965. By 1967\, Joanie was with Columbia and following year with Capitol but still the hits continued to elude her – notwithstanding the quality of her recordings.  “Step Inside Love” had been a #8 UK hit for Cilla Black during Cilla’s ten year chart run from the early 60s.  The Happy Tiger label was owned by the Flying Tiger Line\, an air freight company. The label ran from 1968-71 and was home to artists such as Donnie Brooks\, Priscilla Paris and Them.

COL title VAL Joga COL performer VAL Scala & Kolacny Brothers	COL video title VAL Jerry Lee Lewis - Let's Talk About Us COL description VAL Jerry Lee Lewis (born September 29\, 1935) is an American singer-songwriter\, musician\, and pianist\, who is often known by his nickname of The Killer and is often viewed as "rock & roll's first great wild man." As an early pioneer of rock and roll music\, in 1956 Lewis made his first recordings at Sun Records in Memphis. "Crazy Arms" sold 300\,000 copies in the South\, but it was his 1957 hit "Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On" that shot Lewis to fame worldwide. Lewis followed this when he recorded songs such as "Great Balls of Fire"\, "Breathless" and "High School Confidential". However\, Lewis's rock and roll career faltered in the wake of his marriage to his 13-year-old cousin when he was 22. He had little success in the charts following the scandal and his popularity quickly faded. His live performance fees plummeted from $10\,000 per night to $250. In the meantime he was determined to gain back some of his popularity. During the early 1960s he didn't have much chart success with few exceptions such as "What'd I Say". His live performances at this time were increasingly wild and energetic. His album Live at the Star Club\, Hamburg from 1964 is often regarded by many music journalists and fans as one of the wildest and greatest rock and roll concert albums ever. After recording songs such as "I'm on Fire" for several years with little success\, in 1968 Lewis made a transition into country music and had hits with songs such as "Another Place\, Another Time". This reignited his career and throughout the late 1960s and 1970s he regularly topped the country-western charts. His No. 1 country hits included "To Make Love Sweeter For You"\, "There Must Be More to Love Than This"\, "Would You Take Another Chance on Me" and "Me and Bobby McGee" COL channel name VAL Music Legends Book	0

COL title VAL I'm on the Outside Looking In / It's Gonna Take a Miracle COL performer VAL Cooper & Ross	COL video title VAL Eugene Maslov-Chan's Song(Never Said)-2000 COL description VAL A pretty quick follow-up to his first CD When I Need to Smile\, Face of Love finds Maslov incorporating guests Toots Thielemans on harmonica and Shirley Horn on vocals\, and interpreting jazz and pop music from '60s icons\, adding an occasional innocuous synth wash here and there. Eddie Gomez is back on bass for eight cuts\, and Willie Jones\, George Schuller\, and Steve Williams split up drum chores. Asserting himself as a pyrotechnist\, Maslov's fine original playing comes to the forefront; he injects hard chords and neat ideas into the up samba of Herbie Hancock and Stevie Wonder's "Chan's Song." The Miles Davis-Victor Feldman evergreen "Seven Steps to Heaven" is wittily arranged\, shifting back and forth from upbeat waltz to regular 4/4 pace. A most interesting version of the Jimmy Rowles number "The Peacocks" sports heavy\, dense textures from Gomez with Maslov's left piano hand and synth\, and slight funk by Jones. The trio dives head first with no intro into "Them There Eyes\," jump starts "The Groove Merchant" including a solo piano break\, and adopts a more contemporary samba mode for Maslov's "Through Russian Eyes." Horn sings two ballads written by Mack Street honcho Gretchen Carhartt\, the tick-tock rhythm on the unrequited love torch song of a title track\, and the regret-filled "Come Back to Me Love." Thielemans' features are the "Days of Wine & Roses"-flavored ballad "More Love" and the classic\, tender waltz "Bluesette." This CD is an improvement and a continuation along the lines of the previous recording. ~ Michael G. Nastos jazz pianist's 2nd release on Mack Avenue offers a superb selection of songs ranging from Herbie Hancock's "Never Said" to Miles Davis/Victor Feldman's "Seven Steps To Heaven\," as well as originals; inc. vocals by Grammy winner Shirley Horn\, feat. specia Recorded at Clinton Studios\, New York\, New York in May & June 1999.

The original line-up consisted of Brian le Gassick – lead vocals\, guitar\, John Leach – lead guitar\, Willie van der Walt – bass and Ian Miller – drums.

In 1969 John Elliot – sax\, joined the group and in 1970 Ivor Black – drums and Peter Vee – lead vocals (Steve Lonsdale left for America).

COL title VAL Little Egypt COL performer VAL Kaleidoscope	COL video title VAL John Fogerty - Have Thine Own Way\, Lord.wmv COL description VAL The Blue Ridge Rangers Is the first solo album by John Fogerty\, the former lead singer and lead guitarist of Creedence Clearwater Revival. Upon its initial release by Fantasy Records in 1973\, the album was credited to "The Blue Ridge Rangers" with no mention of Fogerty on the cover. Fogerty chose to do this in order to distance himself from his Creedence legacy. The LP was later reissued and credited to John Fogerty with a different cover design. The CD reissue restores the original silhouette cover photo and credits the album to Fogerty. The album is made up entirely of traditional and country covers\, and features Fogerty playing all the instruments. The album peaked at #47 on the charts. Two singles from the album became hits: "Jambalaya" which peaked at #16\, and "Hearts of Stone" which peaked at #37. In 2009\, Fogerty released a sequel to this album\, entitled The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again.  Track listing Side one 1. "Blue Ridge Mountain Blues" (Traditional) -- 2:29 2.

I lay there in the sun And felt it caressing my face As I fell asleep And dreamed. I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie And that I was the star of the movie. This really blew my mind\, The fact that me\, An overfed\, long-haired\, leaping gnome\, Should be the star of a Hollywood movie. Hmm\, but there I was. I was taken to a place\, The hall of the mountain king. I stood high upon a mountain top\, Naked to the world\, In front of every kind of girl. There was long ones\, tall ones\, short ones\, brown ones\, Black ones\, round ones\, big ones\, crazy ones. Out of the middle Came a lady. She whispered in my ear Something crazy. She said\, Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl." I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back As she disappeared\, But soon she returned. In her hand was a bottle of wine\, In the other\, a glass. She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass And raised it to her lips And\, just before she drank it\, She said\, Take the wine\, take that girl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl." Take that pearl\, yeah. It's on girl\, all you gotta do is spill that wine\, spill that wine. Let me feel\, let me feel fine\, yeah\, yeah. Spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, take that pearl.

Les Paul had recorded an instrumental version two years earlier. The website carolinacotton.org says\, "The next MGM session took place in New York\, in August 1952. For this recording\, no expense was spared...Carolina recorded 2 songs with the LeRoy Holmes Orchestra. "Nola" was a true showcase of her yodeling talent. It even featured a technological breakthrough\, "sound-on-sound" (this was before the days of common multitracking)\, giving the illusion of her yodels echoing across the mountaintops."  http://www.carolinacotton.org/music.html http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012CIW1O/ http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043367KM/ https://www.facebook.com/pages/Carolina-Cotton/145578387436 COL channel name VAL Phil Pebcak	0

COL description VAL I Sold My Heart To The Junkman - The Silhouettes (Ace Records) 1958\, 45 rpm!  A Direct Recording!  This song was released earlier on the Junior label\, same version & same flip-side. Before the group became The Silhouettes they were known as The Gospel Tornadoes when they sang in churches on Sundays. When they sang in nightclubs during the rest of the week they were known as The Thunderbirds.  Kae Williams a local disc jockey (WDAS) and the owner of Junior records named the group after The Rays 1957 hit single on Cameo 117 "Silhouettes". Kae Williams refused to release The Silhouettes version of "For Your Precious Love" which they cut while on the road after hearing Jerry Butler & The Impressions version\, due to his friendship with Abner records executive Ewart Abner.

Riding through dust clouds and barren wastes Galloping hard on the plains Chasing the redskins back to their holes Fighting them at their own game Murder for freedom a stab in the back Women and children and cowards attack  Run to the hills run for your lives Run to the hills run for your lives  Soldier blue on the barren wastes Hunting and killing their game Raping the women and wasting the men The only good indians are tame Selling them whiskey and taking their gold Enslaving the young and destroying the old  Run to the hills run for your lives COL channel name VAL Milan Japundzic	0

Stan Kelly  Lyrics: Oh you are a mucky kid\, Dirty as a dustbin lid. When he hears the things you did\, You'll gerra belt from your Dad. Oh you have your father's nose\, So crimson in the dark it glows\, If you're not asleep when the boozers close\, You'll gerra belt from your Dad.   You look so scruffy lying dur Strawberry-jam tats in yer 'air\, Though in the world you haven't a care And I have got so many. It's quite a struggle every day Living on your father's pay\, The bugger drinks it all away And leaves me without any.   Although we have no silver spoon\, Better days are coming soon Now Nelly's working at the Lune And she gets paid on Friday. Perhaps one day we'll have a splash\, When Littlewoods provide the cash\, We'll get a house in Knotty Ash And buy your Dad a brewery.   Oh you are a mucky kid\, Dirty as a dustbin lid. When he hears the things you did You'll gerra belt from your Dad. Oh you have your father's face\, You're growing up a real hard case\, But there's no one can take your place\, .... Go fast asleep for yer Mammy. COL channel name VAL DecemberedCorpInc	0

Lulu Gainsbourg\, acaba de sacar  el disco (si no me equivoco es el primero) From Gainsbourg to Lulu y fue sobre lo seguro: un disco homenaje a su padre\, es decir desde el principio hasta el final con grandes canciones\, y como si esto no bastara\, con numerosos y conocidísimos  (tanto del cine como de la música) invitados.

This song is one of my favorites by CSN and the harmonies are particularly good. Just sit back\, listen and enjoy a truly beautiful song with great lyrics.  Lyrics:  Helplessly hoping Her harlequin hovers nearby Awaiting a word Gasping at glimpses Of gentle true spirit He runs\, wishing he could fly Only to trip at the sound of good-bye  Wordlessly watching He waits by the window And wonders  At the empty place inside Heartlessly helping himself to her bad dreams He worries Did he hear a good-bye? Or even hello?  They are one person They are two alone They are three together They are for each other  Stand by the stairway You'll see something Certain to tell you confusion has its cost Love isn't lying It's loose in a lady who lingers Saying she is lost And choking on hello  They are one person They are two alone They are three together They are for each other COL channel name VAL Hoodoo You Love?	1

COL title VAL Reach Out and Touch (Somebody's Hand) COL performer VAL Dana	COL video title VAL Bill Withers - Who Is He (And What Is He to You) COL description VAL Bill Withers - Who Is He (And What Is He to You)  William Harrison "Bill" Withers\, Jr. (born July 4\, 1938) is an American singer-songwriter and musician who performed and recorded from 1970 until 1985. Some of his best-known songs are "Lean on Me"\, "Ain't No Sunshine"\, "Use Me"\, "Just the Two of Us"\, "Lovely Day"\, and "Grandma's Hands". His life was recently the subject of the documentary film Still Bill. Withers was born the youngest of thirteen children in the small coal-mining town of Slab Fork\, West Virginia. Raised in nearby Beckley\, West Virginia\, Withers was thirteen years old when his father died. He enlisted with the United States Navy at age eighteen and served for nine years\, during which time he became interested in singing and writing songs. Soon after his discharge from the Navy in 1970\, he relocated to Los Angeles for a musical career. Withers worked as an assembler for several different companies\, including Douglas Aircraft Corporation\, while recording demo tapes with his own money\, shopping them around and performing in clubs at night. When he debuted with the song "Ain't No Sunshine" he refused to resign his job because of his belief that the music business was a fickle industry and that he was still a novice compared to other acts.  Lyrics  A man we passed just tried to stare me down  And when I looked at you\, you looked at the ground  I don't know who he is but I think that you do   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   I have something in my heart and in your eyes  Tell me he's not someone just passin' by  And when you cleared your throat was that your cue   Dag gummit dag  Who is he and what is he to you   Now when I add the sum of you and me  I get confused and I keep coming up with three  You're too much for one man but not enough for two   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Hey you tell me man don't have not much for intuition  That what you really think or are you wishin'  Before you wreck your old home be certain of the new   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you COL channel name VAL Alf	0

On this freewheeling and jubilant 13-track tribute\, MTO is propelled by a dynamic cast of special guests\, including Antony Hegarty\, Bernie Worrell\, Bill Laswell\, Dean Bowman\, Martha Wainwright\, Sandra St. Victor\, Shilpa Ray and Vernon Reid\, treating Sly & The Family Stone with the same (ir)reverence it would Duke Ellington or Count Basie. By illuminating the melodic and harmonic sophistication of the iconoclast's body of work\, MTO re-imagine Sly Stone through the filter of their own "downtown NYC" aesthetic\, while still upholding the Day-Glo soul and psychedelic funk that is the backbone for classics like "M'Lady\," "Everyday People" and "Family Affair." Both the CD and LP versions of the release include extensive liner notes by Steven Bernstein and music historian Greg Tate along with never before seen photos from the recording sessions.  MTO is Steven Bernstein\, Peter Apfelbaum\, Doug Wieselman\, Erik Lawrence\, Curtis Fowlkes\, Charlie Burnham\, Matt Munisteri\, Ben Allison and Ben Perowsky COL channel name VAL The Royal Potato Family	0

The record is over 50 years old and has a high amount of surface noise. The extreme detail of the music can be heard\, despite the surface noise.  I've been working to reduce surface noise pickup and have exhausted all the techniques I know of to reduce that noise. That AT92ECD cartridge I use has a .3 X .7 mil stylus and my pre amp system makes no compromises in high frequency response or low noise performance\, so I would especially appreciate suggestions from anyone who may be able to hear and point me to it's cause. Thank you.  UPDATE: 1/14/2012 I've worked up a satisfactory deep-groove cleaning system. I'll be posting very clean records soon and plan to produce a video about my wacky method.

COL title VAL Black Sabbath Medley COL performer VAL Candlemass	COL video title VAL Henry Mancini -   Tiny Bubbles COL description VAL "I think there is a song out there to describe just about any situation."― Criss Jami ▼▼▼  HENRY MANCINI Enrico Nicola "Henry" Mancini was an American composer\, arranger and conductor\, who is best remembered for his film and television scores.  He won a record number of Grammy Awards\, plus a posthumous Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995. His best-known works include the jazz-idiom theme to The Pink Panther film series ("The Pink Panther Theme") and the theme to the Peter Gunn television series.  Mancini had a long collaboration with the film director Blake Edwards and won numerous Academy Awards for the songs in Edwards films\, including "Moon River" from Breakfast at Tiffany's\, "Days of Wine and Roses" and for the score to "Victor Victoria". Entering 1946\, Mancini became a pianist and arranger for the newly re-formed Glenn Miller Orchestra\, led by 'Everyman' Tex Beneke. After World War II\, Mancini broadened his skills in composition\, counterpoint\, harmony and orchestration during studies opening with the composers Ernst Krenek and Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco.  In 1952\, Mancini joined the Universal Pictures music department. During the next six years\, he contributed music to over 100 movies\, most notably The Creature from the Black Lagoon\, It Came from Outer Space\, Tarantula\, This Island Earth\, The Glenn Miller Story (for which he received his first Academy Award nomination)\, The Benny Goodman Story and Orson Welles' Touch of Evil. During this time\, he also wrote some popular songs. His first hit was a single by Guy Lombardo and His Royal Canadians titled I Won't Let You Out of My Heart. Mancini left Universal to work as an independent composer/arranger in 1958. Soon after\, he scored the television series Peter Gunn for writer/producer Blake Edwards. This was the genesis of a relationship in which Edwards and Mancini collaborated on 30 films over 35 years.  Along with Alex North\, Elmer Bernstein\, Leith Stevens and Johnny Mandel\, Henry Mancini was a pioneer of the inclusion of jazz elements in the late romantic orchestral film and TV scoring prevalent at the time. Mancini scored many TV movies\, including The Thorn Birds and The Shadow Box. He wrote many television themes\, including Mr. Lucky (starring John Vivyan and Ross Martin)\, NBC Mystery Movie\, What's Happening\, Tic Tac Dough (1990 version) and Once Is Not Enough. In the 1984--85 television season\, four series featured original Mancini themes: Newhart\, Hotel\, Remington Steele\, and Ripley's Believe It or Not. Mancini also composed the "Viewer Mail" theme for Late Night with David Letterman. Mancini composed the theme for NBC Nightly News used beginning in 1975\, and a different theme by him\, titled Salute to the President was used by NBC News for its election coverage (including primaries and conventions) from 1976 to 1992. Salute to the President was only published in a school-band arrangement\, although Mancini performed it frequently with symphony orchestras on his concert tours. Songs with music by Mancini were staples of the easy listening genre from the 1960s to the 1980s. Some of the artists who have recorded Mancini songs include Andy Williams\, Paul Anka\, Pat Boone\, Anita Bryant\, Jack Jones\, Frank Sinatra\, Perry Como\, Connie Francis\, Eydie Gorme\, Steve Lawrence\, Trini Lopez\, George Maharis\, Johnny Mathis\, Jerry Vale and Ray Conniff\, to name just a few.... Mancini recorded over 90 albums\, in styles ranging from big band to light classical to pop. Eight of these albums were certified gold by The Recording Industry Association of America. He had a 20-year contract with RCA Records\, resulting in 60 commercial record albums that made him a household name among artists of easy-listening music.  TINY BUBBLES "Tiny Bubbles" is a song written by Martin Denny and Leon Pober. It was released in 1966 by Don Ho.  It is widely considered to be Denny's most famous song.  MHO "Tiny Bubbles" is -\, with all due respect for Mr Denny\, a rather "simple" song but... hand the notes to a top arranger like Henry Mancini and .... what you get is a fabulous orchestral arrangement that\, in a way\, transforms the song into an easy floating ballad.  A particularly rich instrumentation with strings\, brass\, and all the other "standard" instruments of a large orchestra\, completed with the sound of the ukelele and harp\, so typical for the Hawaiian style music.  The Mancini chorus adds some warmth and "body" to the recording\, so\, in the end\, we get to hear a splendid version of this well known theme.   Have a great (musical) trip to "Aloha country" :) !  Enjoy. COL channel name VAL Socratess2007	0

COL title VAL Days COL performer VAL Colin Meloy	COL video title VAL Average White Band ~ If I Ever Lose This Heaven "1975" Funk COL description VAL Their self-effacing name to the contrary\, Average White Band was anything but -- one of the few white groups to cross the color line and achieve success and credibility playing funk\, with their tight\, fiery sound also belying their Scottish heritage\, evoking American R&B hotbeds like Detroit\, Memphis\, and Philadelphia instead. Singer/bassist Alan Gorrie\, guitarists Hamish Stuart and Onnie McIntyre\, tenor saxophonist Malcolm Duncan\, keyboardist/saxophonist Roger Ball\, and drummer Robbie McIntosh comprised the original Average White Band lineup. Veterans of numerous Scottish soul and jazz groups\, they made their debut in 1973 as the opening act at Eric Clapton's Rainbow Theatre comeback gig\, soon issuing their debut LP\, Show Your Hand\, to little notice. After adopting the abbreviated moniker AWB\, a year later the band issued their self-titled sophomore effort\, topping the American pop charts with the Arif Mardin-produced instrumental "Pick Up the Pieces." The record's mammoth success was nevertheless tempered by the September 23\, 1974 death of McIntosh\, who died at a Hollywood party after overdosing on heroin.  Cut the Cake Ex-Bloodstone drummer Steve Ferrone replaced McIntosh for AWB's third album\, 1975's Cut the Cake\, which scored a Top Ten hit with its title track as well as two other chart entries\, "If I Ever Lose This Heaven" and "School Boy Crush." (Put It Where You Want It\, issued later that same year\, was simply a retitled and repackaged Show Your Hand.) With 1976's Soul Searching\, the group reclaimed the full Average White Band name\, scoring their final Top 40 hit with "Queen of My Soul." Following the live Person to Person\, they issued Benny & Us\, a collaboration with soul legend Ben E. King. However\, after subsequent outings\, including 1978's Warmer Communications\, 1979's Feel No Fret\, and 1980's Shine\, failed to recapture the energy of AWB's peak\, the group dissolved in 1982\, with Ferrone later joining Duran Duran and Stuart recording with Paul McCartney. Gorrie\, Ball\, and McIntyre reformed Average White Band in 1989\, tapping vocalist Alex Ligertwood for their comeback effort Aftershock. Oft-sampled by hip-hop producers throughout the 1990s\, the group continued touring prior to releasing Soul Tattoo in 1996. The live album\, Face to Face\, followed three years later.

COL title VAL Checkin' up on My Baby COL performer VAL Cuby + Blizzards	COL video title VAL Jerry Lee Lewis - Let's Talk About Us COL description VAL Jerry Lee Lewis (born September 29\, 1935) is an American singer-songwriter\, musician\, and pianist\, who is often known by his nickname of The Killer and is often viewed as "rock & roll's first great wild man." As an early pioneer of rock and roll music\, in 1956 Lewis made his first recordings at Sun Records in Memphis. "Crazy Arms" sold 300\,000 copies in the South\, but it was his 1957 hit "Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On" that shot Lewis to fame worldwide. Lewis followed this when he recorded songs such as "Great Balls of Fire"\, "Breathless" and "High School Confidential". However\, Lewis's rock and roll career faltered in the wake of his marriage to his 13-year-old cousin when he was 22. He had little success in the charts following the scandal and his popularity quickly faded. His live performance fees plummeted from $10\,000 per night to $250. In the meantime he was determined to gain back some of his popularity. During the early 1960s he didn't have much chart success with few exceptions such as "What'd I Say". His live performances at this time were increasingly wild and energetic. His album Live at the Star Club\, Hamburg from 1964 is often regarded by many music journalists and fans as one of the wildest and greatest rock and roll concert albums ever. After recording songs such as "I'm on Fire" for several years with little success\, in 1968 Lewis made a transition into country music and had hits with songs such as "Another Place\, Another Time". This reignited his career and throughout the late 1960s and 1970s he regularly topped the country-western charts. His No. 1 country hits included "To Make Love Sweeter For You"\, "There Must Be More to Love Than This"\, "Would You Take Another Chance on Me" and "Me and Bobby McGee" COL channel name VAL Music Legends Book	0

Juliet the dice were loaded from the start and I bet and you exploded in my heart and I forget\, I forget the movie song when you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong juliet?  Come up on different streets they both were streets of shame both dirty both mean yes and the dream was just the same and I dream your dream for you and now your dream is real how can you look at me as I was just another one of your deals?  Well you can fall for chains of silver you can fall for chains of gold you can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold you promised me everything you promised me thick and thin now you just say oh romeo yeah you know I used to have a scene with him  Juliet when we made love you used to cry you said I love you like the stars above you said I'll love you till I die there's a place for us you know the movie song when you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong Juliet?  I can't do the talk like the talk on the tv and I can't do a love song like the way its meant to be I can't do everything but I'd do anything for you can't do anything except be in love with you  And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be all I do is keep the beat the bad company all I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme julie I'd do the stars with you any time  Juliet when we made love you used to cry you said I love you like the stars above you said Ill love you till I die there's a place for us you know the movie song when you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong Juliet?

COL title VAL You Ain't Woman Enough (To Take My Man) COL performer VAL Eilen Jewell	COL video title VAL Bill Withers - Who Is He (And What Is He to You) COL description VAL Bill Withers - Who Is He (And What Is He to You)  William Harrison "Bill" Withers\, Jr. (born July 4\, 1938) is an American singer-songwriter and musician who performed and recorded from 1970 until 1985. Some of his best-known songs are "Lean on Me"\, "Ain't No Sunshine"\, "Use Me"\, "Just the Two of Us"\, "Lovely Day"\, and "Grandma's Hands". His life was recently the subject of the documentary film Still Bill. Withers was born the youngest of thirteen children in the small coal-mining town of Slab Fork\, West Virginia. Raised in nearby Beckley\, West Virginia\, Withers was thirteen years old when his father died. He enlisted with the United States Navy at age eighteen and served for nine years\, during which time he became interested in singing and writing songs. Soon after his discharge from the Navy in 1970\, he relocated to Los Angeles for a musical career. Withers worked as an assembler for several different companies\, including Douglas Aircraft Corporation\, while recording demo tapes with his own money\, shopping them around and performing in clubs at night. When he debuted with the song "Ain't No Sunshine" he refused to resign his job because of his belief that the music business was a fickle industry and that he was still a novice compared to other acts.  Lyrics  A man we passed just tried to stare me down  And when I looked at you\, you looked at the ground  I don't know who he is but I think that you do   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   I have something in my heart and in your eyes  Tell me he's not someone just passin' by  And when you cleared your throat was that your cue   Dag gummit dag  Who is he and what is he to you   Now when I add the sum of you and me  I get confused and I keep coming up with three  You're too much for one man but not enough for two   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Hey you tell me man don't have not much for intuition  That what you really think or are you wishin'  Before you wreck your old home be certain of the new   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you COL channel name VAL Alf	0

COL title VAL Steppin' Out with My Baby COL performer VAL Cherry Poppin' Daddies	COL video title VAL LURLEAN HUNTER  Vocal Jazz Swing. Steppin' Out With My Baby \, I Feel COL description VAL Lurlean Hunter  Singer Lurlean Hunter made five albums on her own during the second half of the '50s\, starting out as a Lonesome Gal on RCA and winding up still feeling Blue & Sentimental for Atlantic. She was discovered in Chicago where she had been singing in many clubs\, including a collaboration with drummer Red Saunders that held forth at the Club DeLisa. Hunter's move to New York City in 1955 was prompted by RCA's interest in recording her. The singer's recording career actually began before she left the Windy City at the behest of indie jazz labels\, some of them quite short-lived -- such as Seymour\, with a catalog topping out at four releases. The press described Hunter as a "blues thrush" in announcing her interpretations of three numbers actually written by the label's owner\, producer and record store owner Seymour Schwartz. The latter promotional blurb inevitably told some truth about Hunter's stylistic traits\, if not her relation to winged fauna. Her recordings were more about rhythm & blues and pop than jazz\, yet were done in an era when such sessions often involved fine mainstream jazz players in the accompaniment. The 1956Night Life\, for example\, featured pianist Hank Jones and tenor saxophonist Al Cohn. Blue & Sentimental -- with arrangements by the progressive Jimmy Giuffre -- was reissued in 2000 as a split CD also including an album by fellow singer Betty Bennett\, a former wife of pianist André Previn.Hunter's final recordings were done in 1964\, at which point she was still well under 40 years old. She is known to have died young\, although details of this tragedy are murky. In one version of the story she was knocked off by a mobster lover\, yet whether anybody was really that mean to Lurlean cannot be completely confirmed.

COL title VAL Les passantes COL performer VAL Debout sur le Zinc	COL video title VAL 'With my eyes wide open I'm dreaming'--Patti Page 'Quartet' (1949) COL description VAL Recorded in November 1949\, this is a classic example of 'multiple' recording\, as opposed to multitrack recording.  At the time this record was made there were no multitrack tape recorders.  In fact\, the studio this was recorded at (most likely Reeves in New York City) had yet to acquire tape equipment; hence\, this recording was made by first recording part of the music on one lacquer disc\, then playing this disc back through a mixer while another part was played or sung live along with the playback\, the mix of these parts being then recorded onto a second lacquer disc.  This was done four times (original recording plus three overdubs) to produce the four vocal parts heard on this record.   Les Paul was the first to produce successful 'multiples' (as he called them)\, both technically and artistically\, and what his label Capitol nicknamed 'The New Sound' spawned a brief fad where other performers tried to mimic his recording technique on their records\, with varying degrees of success.  This record was one of the better ones\, and Patti Page had several hits with this type of sound. COL channel name VAL PerisphereRec	0

COL title VAL Ša-la-la-la-li COL performer VAL Václav Neckář	COL video title VAL Les Terribles - Ce n'est pas une vie COL description VAL Ready for an amazing 60's dance party? Well\, don't forget to bring this platter to the DJ! This band from Paris\, France plays an incredible mix of 60's garage-punk & GoGo Beat and now finally returns with their second longplayer 'Ils sont formidables!'. The band that includes members of THE NO TALENTS\, LES SYNAPSES\, DUTRONC\, CECILIA UND DIE SAUERKRAUTS & OPERATION S goes back to the sound of the French Beat & Roll when it was bitten by the Big Bad British Bug back in 1965. Imagine how THEM\, THE SMALL FACES\, THE YARDBIRDS or the early STONES would've sound if they were from France\, never turned professionals and Van Morrison\, Keith Relf or Mike Jagger were chicks. All the songs are in French\, with that glamorous 'mademoiselle' accent! The band could've been described best as the great french sixties rock band that should have existed but never did. Owing to cultural impediments and lame business practices\, there were very few outstanding french rockers from that period. Ronnie Bird\, Larry Greco\, and a dozen others you've never heard of: LES TERRIBLES cover them all\, and every song makes you wanna dance. The band rounds out their set with some originals\, as well as their own french versions of some great foreign songs that never got adapted before\, all done with a perfect ear for the style. Fronted by the charming and talented chanteuse Rudie this hard-working orchestre delivers the groove that gets the dance floor moving to the Swim\, the Jerk\, and the Hully-Gully. Les Terribles are sur scene ! ((Jon Dragueur) A Top 10 forever-must have this one is. What more can we tell you? COL channel name VAL Matthew East	1
COL title VAL Buzz - Buzz - Buzz COL performer VAL Hollywood Flames	COL video title VAL Doug Sahm - Buzz buzz buzz COL description VAL "Buzz buzz buzz" - many a great single was little more than a few nonsense words cobbled together. This single from the Hollywood Flames in '57 is a great example. And Doug and the boys give it a suitably rip-snorting treatment.  Doug Sahm was an artist who displayed a remarkable capacity for soaking up a wide variety of genres of popular music and demonstrating expertise in such genres\, often within one album.  Outside of a core set of enthusiastic admirers it is just this ability not to be typecast that may well have hampered his acceptance within the wider public domain. Relatively late in his career he recorded a small number of albums which concentrated on one genre or era of music. "Juke Box Music" is one of those albums. It focuses on music that was popular in the Southern US in the fifties. Much of this comes under the broad headings of R&B or doo-wop. The concept of the album is of a jukebox in that timeframe stacked to the gills with great music to dance or smooch to. Doug assembled an ace big band to interpret this music containing many musicians who'd been part of his various ventures in the past.  The main musicians appearing on the album are:  Doug Sahm - Vocals\, Piano & Guitar Rocky Morales - Tenor Sax Charlie McBurney - Trumpet Jack Barber - Bass George Rains - Drums  Addition musicians include:  Wayne Bennett - Guitar Derek O'Brien - Rhythm Guitar Mel Brown - Keyboards Reese Wynans - Keyboards Randy Garibay - Vocal duet Angela Strehli - Background vocals  Produced by George Rains Arrangements by Doug Sahm COL channel name VAL DangerousDaveRR	1

Visa ble presentert under turneen «Vers og viiiiiiser. Lyriske utskeielser ved Harald Sverdrup og Alf Cranner» i 1966\, og utgitt på LP året samme høst.   Sjømannsvise har blitt en av Cranners mest folkekjære viser\, og den har kommet på flere plateinnspillinger siden.   Den svenske trubaduren Cornelis Vreeswijk lagde en egen tekstversjon av Sjømannsvise som han kalt Ågren.   Han oppgav opprinnelig melodien som «norsk folketone»\, men førte opp Cranner som komponist da han gav ut visa på plata Poem\, ballader och lite blues i 1970.  En sjømannsvise er en vise om sjømenn og livet ombord\, eller en vise som er populær blant sjømenn.   Sjømannsviser kan deles i to grupper. Sjantier som var arbeidssangen ombord på seilskutene og frivaktsviser som var populære sanger blant sjømenn. COL channel name VAL Cauldron20	0

COL title VAL About a Quarter to Nine COL performer VAL Al Jolson	COL video title VAL Cliff Richard - We Don't Talk Anymore (1979) COL description VAL Britain's answer to Elvis Presley\, Richard (born Harry Webb) dominated the pre-Beatles British pop scene in the late '50s and early '60s. An accomplished singer with a genuine feel for the music\, Richard's artistic legacy is nonetheless meager\, as he was quickly steered toward a middle-of-the-road pop direction. Several of his late-'50s recordings\, however\, were genuinely exciting Presley-esque rockers -- especially his first hit\, "Move It" (1958) -- and gave British teenagers their first taste of genuine homegrown rock & roll talent. Backed by the Shadows -- clean-cut instrumental virtuosos who became legends of their own -- Richard embarked on a truly awesome string of hit singles in Britain\, scoring no less than 43 Top 20 hits between 1958 and 1969. One of these\, although it was by no means one of the more successful\, was an actual Mick Jagger/Keith Richards composition (the ballad "Blue Turns to Grey").  In his homeland\, Richard's popularity was diminished only slightly by the rise of the Beatles\, but in his prime\, he had a much rougher time in the U.S.\, hitting the Top 40 only three times (with "Living Doll" in 1959\, "It's All in the Game" in 1963\, and "Devil Woman" in 1976). Richard belatedly cracked the U.S. Top Ten in 1976 with "Devil Woman\," and racked up a few other hits ("We Don't Talk Anymore\," "Dreaming\," "A Little in Love") in a mainstream pop/rock style. He remains an institution in Britain\, where he is one of the nation's most popular all-around entertainers of all time. ~ Richie Unterberger\, All Music Guide _____________________________________ In 2008\, Richard's 50th year in music\, will see the release of the 8CD box set\, And They Said It Wouldn't Last (My 50 Years In Music). In September\, a single celebrating his 50 years in pop music\, titled * Thank you for a Lifetime has been released. On the 14th of September 2008 Thank You For A Lifetime reached No.3 on the UK music charts\, which gives Cliff a Top 3 hit in each of his six decades as a singer. On 2nd November 2008\, British newspaper The Mail on Sunday gave away a free promotional CD entitled '50th Anniversary' containing 12 tracks picked by Sir Cliff himself.

Both songs were originally sung by Ben E. King and made the R&B top 20\, and "I'll Be There" also reached number 12 on the pop chart. In 1962 she recorded "Dance With a Dolly (With a Hole in her Stocking)"\, previously made famous by The Andrews Sisters and Bill Haley\, for Mercury Records. In 1966 she had a minor hit with a cover of the Jacques Brel song "If You Go Away."  She worked with Ray Charles\, Count Basie\, and Lionel Hampton. And\, in 1963\, she released a recording for Mercury Records with Billy Eckstine and Bobby Tucker Orchestra.  Damita Jo was later involved in comedy and toured with Redd Foxx.

In June 1987 Gerald Arthur Friend picked up a 14-year-old female friend after leaving a concert at the Tacoma Dome. Upon trying to exit the car the girl was handcuffed and held hostage at knife point. The girl was taken to a mobile home where she was tortured and raped with various objects for two days. She was also threatened with a blowtorch."  we recorded our cover of "polly" for SPIN magazine's "Newermind" tribute/compilation to mark the 20th anniversary of "Nevermind" in september. michael (who a lot of you have seen as the new drummer of my touring band\, the grand theft orchestra) produced/engineered and played bass on the recording.  this is a video me (glockenspiel\, vocals\, Taurus bass pedal)\, chad raines (banjo\, percussion)\, and michael (bass\, percussion) shot in new haven\, CT on a super-tight budget with the help of some actors and filmmakers from around new york and yale.   we filmed it in one day in november...i wrote the script and michael directed the video. blake\, who plays the angel\, is also on the cover of the first dolls' album "a is for accident"...looking very different in a long red dress.  so many people loaned us stuff and worked for free on this video to keep us under budget - THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH.  x afp ________________  FULL CREDITS & THANK YOUS...  song by NIRVANA  starring CHRISTOPHER M.

Along with Buck Owens\, Haggard and his band The Strangers helped create the Bakersfield sound\, which is characterized by the unique twang of Fender Telecaster and the unique mix with the traditional country steel guitar sound\, new vocal harmony styles in which the words are minimal\, and a rough edge not heard on the more polished Nashville sound recordings of the same era.  By the 1970s\, Haggard was aligned with the growing outlaw country movement\, and has continued to release successful albums through the 1990s and into the 2000s. In 1994\, he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.  In 1997\, he was inducted into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame. COL channel name VAL Marcus Brazil	1

He began writing the lyrics at home\, but never quite finished them\, because he had to fly to Nashville\, Tennessee for a recording session with veteran Columbia producer\, Don Law. Jimmy simply brought along the unfinished song. By the time he got off the plane\, he was virtually jumping with excitement. The song was completed and Don Law liked it so much\, that Big Bad John was recorded immediately" - (Side note: There's a little touch of "Sixteen Tons" by Tennessee Ernie Ford here as well) -  Note: What many today call\, "rapping" was originally\, in a cleaner form\, referred to as\,  "calling". Talking in rhyming sentences or speaking the lyrics instead of singing them\, which was very common in Country & Western music. It began with the square dance "caller" who gave direction to the dancers\, through rhyming sentences set to the cadence or beat of the music being played by a live band. He never sang\, he just spoke the words in rhyme. Much the same as a auction house auctioneer\, who speaks the bids in a fast rhythm\, choosing words which often rhyme.  The "caller" and the dance can be:  "traced back through England  to the old French cotillions" (17th century) (per Lloyd Shaw-1939). Also\, a form of "calling" or "auction house crying" can be found in the 1947 recording of\, "Smoke\, Smoke\, Smoke (That Cigarette) (Tex Williams & Phil Harris) or "The Darktown Poker Club" (1946) (Phil Harris) for example\, and many other older recordings. Therefore\, "rap" isn't new\, it's just a continuation of something which started many years earlier. (* No one has ever said this\,  but I believe\, "Cajun Doll"\, by Lattie Moore\,  may have inspired the writing of both "Big Bad John" and "The Cajun Queen". ) COL channel name VAL MrRJDB1969	0

COL title VAL Radioactivity COL performer VAL Kruger	COL video title VAL Henry Mancini -   Tiny Bubbles COL description VAL "I think there is a song out there to describe just about any situation."― Criss Jami ▼▼▼  HENRY MANCINI Enrico Nicola "Henry" Mancini was an American composer\, arranger and conductor\, who is best remembered for his film and television scores.  He won a record number of Grammy Awards\, plus a posthumous Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995. His best-known works include the jazz-idiom theme to The Pink Panther film series ("The Pink Panther Theme") and the theme to the Peter Gunn television series.  Mancini had a long collaboration with the film director Blake Edwards and won numerous Academy Awards for the songs in Edwards films\, including "Moon River" from Breakfast at Tiffany's\, "Days of Wine and Roses" and for the score to "Victor Victoria". Entering 1946\, Mancini became a pianist and arranger for the newly re-formed Glenn Miller Orchestra\, led by 'Everyman' Tex Beneke. After World War II\, Mancini broadened his skills in composition\, counterpoint\, harmony and orchestration during studies opening with the composers Ernst Krenek and Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco.  In 1952\, Mancini joined the Universal Pictures music department. During the next six years\, he contributed music to over 100 movies\, most notably The Creature from the Black Lagoon\, It Came from Outer Space\, Tarantula\, This Island Earth\, The Glenn Miller Story (for which he received his first Academy Award nomination)\, The Benny Goodman Story and Orson Welles' Touch of Evil. During this time\, he also wrote some popular songs. His first hit was a single by Guy Lombardo and His Royal Canadians titled I Won't Let You Out of My Heart. Mancini left Universal to work as an independent composer/arranger in 1958. Soon after\, he scored the television series Peter Gunn for writer/producer Blake Edwards. This was the genesis of a relationship in which Edwards and Mancini collaborated on 30 films over 35 years.  Along with Alex North\, Elmer Bernstein\, Leith Stevens and Johnny Mandel\, Henry Mancini was a pioneer of the inclusion of jazz elements in the late romantic orchestral film and TV scoring prevalent at the time. Mancini scored many TV movies\, including The Thorn Birds and The Shadow Box. He wrote many television themes\, including Mr. Lucky (starring John Vivyan and Ross Martin)\, NBC Mystery Movie\, What's Happening\, Tic Tac Dough (1990 version) and Once Is Not Enough. In the 1984--85 television season\, four series featured original Mancini themes: Newhart\, Hotel\, Remington Steele\, and Ripley's Believe It or Not. Mancini also composed the "Viewer Mail" theme for Late Night with David Letterman. Mancini composed the theme for NBC Nightly News used beginning in 1975\, and a different theme by him\, titled Salute to the President was used by NBC News for its election coverage (including primaries and conventions) from 1976 to 1992. Salute to the President was only published in a school-band arrangement\, although Mancini performed it frequently with symphony orchestras on his concert tours. Songs with music by Mancini were staples of the easy listening genre from the 1960s to the 1980s. Some of the artists who have recorded Mancini songs include Andy Williams\, Paul Anka\, Pat Boone\, Anita Bryant\, Jack Jones\, Frank Sinatra\, Perry Como\, Connie Francis\, Eydie Gorme\, Steve Lawrence\, Trini Lopez\, George Maharis\, Johnny Mathis\, Jerry Vale and Ray Conniff\, to name just a few.... Mancini recorded over 90 albums\, in styles ranging from big band to light classical to pop. Eight of these albums were certified gold by The Recording Industry Association of America. He had a 20-year contract with RCA Records\, resulting in 60 commercial record albums that made him a household name among artists of easy-listening music.  TINY BUBBLES "Tiny Bubbles" is a song written by Martin Denny and Leon Pober. It was released in 1966 by Don Ho.  It is widely considered to be Denny's most famous song.  MHO "Tiny Bubbles" is -\, with all due respect for Mr Denny\, a rather "simple" song but... hand the notes to a top arranger like Henry Mancini and .... what you get is a fabulous orchestral arrangement that\, in a way\, transforms the song into an easy floating ballad.  A particularly rich instrumentation with strings\, brass\, and all the other "standard" instruments of a large orchestra\, completed with the sound of the ukelele and harp\, so typical for the Hawaiian style music.  The Mancini chorus adds some warmth and "body" to the recording\, so\, in the end\, we get to hear a splendid version of this well known theme.   Have a great (musical) trip to "Aloha country" :) !

Time to make her laughter ring. Time to give her everything.   For my Angelica\, my Angelica. There`s so much you never knew. So much I always meant to say\, and do\, for you\, for you. Angelica-a-a...   And then the cold winds came. And when I spoke her name. And held her near me. She couldn`t hear me...   The shadow had been cast. Too many springs had passed. For Angelica\, sweet Angelica. Now in my silent room\, I tend the flowers that I`d buy. As they slowly fade and die. Watered by the tears I cry.   For my Angelica\, my Angelica.

COL title VAL Watcha Gonna Do About It COL performer VAL Dan McCafferty	COL video title VAL ELLIE POP - WHATCHA GONNA DO ABOUT IT.wmv COL description VAL ELLIE POP - 'Watcha Gonna Do 'Bout It' (Mainstream S-6115) 1968  Before I started collecting original 60s garage/psych 45s I spent decades buying (mostly) original and re-issue albums and one of my early purchases was this obscurity by Ellie Pop on Mainstream Records. This album is hard to find and commands a decent price tag but it was re-issued a few years ago and should now be available to a larger audience at last.  In my opinion Ellie Pop were treading their own path in 1968\, there's no fuzz\, no psych touches\, no 1968isms of heavy guitars and keyboards. What you get is a collection of beautifully constructed pop songs that suggest a big Anglophile influence\, in particular mid-60s period Beatles. They sound similar to say The Merry-Go-Round or The Left Banke but without the baroque touches. Just pure pop\, or should I say Ellie Pop.  Virtually every review I've read online or in Shindig for instance\, fails to mention that 'Whatcha Gonna Do 'Bout It' is a cover of a Hollies cut they recorded in 1963 for their debut album 'Stay With The Hollies.' Ellie Pop wrote all of their own tunes except this one!  I'm not certain where Ellie Pop hailed from or even the full names of the group members but it has been suggested elsewhere that they were from Detroit. Maybe someone can confirm this?  http://expo67-cavestones.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/ellie-pop-whatcha-gonna-do-bout-it.html COL channel name VAL ACID REVOLVER	1

COL title VAL Sha La La La Lee COL performer VAL Plastic Bertrand	COL video title VAL Les Terribles - Ce n'est pas une vie COL description VAL Ready for an amazing 60's dance party? Well\, don't forget to bring this platter to the DJ! This band from Paris\, France plays an incredible mix of 60's garage-punk & GoGo Beat and now finally returns with their second longplayer 'Ils sont formidables!'. The band that includes members of THE NO TALENTS\, LES SYNAPSES\, DUTRONC\, CECILIA UND DIE SAUERKRAUTS & OPERATION S goes back to the sound of the French Beat & Roll when it was bitten by the Big Bad British Bug back in 1965. Imagine how THEM\, THE SMALL FACES\, THE YARDBIRDS or the early STONES would've sound if they were from France\, never turned professionals and Van Morrison\, Keith Relf or Mike Jagger were chicks. All the songs are in French\, with that glamorous 'mademoiselle' accent! The band could've been described best as the great french sixties rock band that should have existed but never did. Owing to cultural impediments and lame business practices\, there were very few outstanding french rockers from that period. Ronnie Bird\, Larry Greco\, and a dozen others you've never heard of: LES TERRIBLES cover them all\, and every song makes you wanna dance. The band rounds out their set with some originals\, as well as their own french versions of some great foreign songs that never got adapted before\, all done with a perfect ear for the style. Fronted by the charming and talented chanteuse Rudie this hard-working orchestre delivers the groove that gets the dance floor moving to the Swim\, the Jerk\, and the Hully-Gully. Les Terribles are sur scene ! ((Jon Dragueur) A Top 10 forever-must have this one is. What more can we tell you? COL channel name VAL Matthew East	1

A real "Jazz Oddity" - Federica Zammarchi "Jazz Oddity"\, consists in eleven re-arrangements of songs of David Bowie. Its concept came up a few years ago\, when she needed to mix together her two main musical loves\, namely jazz and 70's rock\, both so important during her forming years. It was recorded with an Italian all- star band and it showcases a uniquely innovative sound\, slightly influenced by european bands like the Esbjörn Svensson Trio\, coining a new genre definition called "PowerJazz".

COL title VAL I Want to Be with You COL performer VAL Nancy Wilson	COL video title VAL Bill Withers - Who Is He (And What Is He to You) COL description VAL Bill Withers - Who Is He (And What Is He to You)  William Harrison "Bill" Withers\, Jr. (born July 4\, 1938) is an American singer-songwriter and musician who performed and recorded from 1970 until 1985. Some of his best-known songs are "Lean on Me"\, "Ain't No Sunshine"\, "Use Me"\, "Just the Two of Us"\, "Lovely Day"\, and "Grandma's Hands". His life was recently the subject of the documentary film Still Bill. Withers was born the youngest of thirteen children in the small coal-mining town of Slab Fork\, West Virginia. Raised in nearby Beckley\, West Virginia\, Withers was thirteen years old when his father died. He enlisted with the United States Navy at age eighteen and served for nine years\, during which time he became interested in singing and writing songs. Soon after his discharge from the Navy in 1970\, he relocated to Los Angeles for a musical career. Withers worked as an assembler for several different companies\, including Douglas Aircraft Corporation\, while recording demo tapes with his own money\, shopping them around and performing in clubs at night. When he debuted with the song "Ain't No Sunshine" he refused to resign his job because of his belief that the music business was a fickle industry and that he was still a novice compared to other acts.  Lyrics  A man we passed just tried to stare me down  And when I looked at you\, you looked at the ground  I don't know who he is but I think that you do   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   I have something in my heart and in your eyes  Tell me he's not someone just passin' by  And when you cleared your throat was that your cue   Dag gummit dag  Who is he and what is he to you   Now when I add the sum of you and me  I get confused and I keep coming up with three  You're too much for one man but not enough for two   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Hey you tell me man don't have not much for intuition  That what you really think or are you wishin'  Before you wreck your old home be certain of the new   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you COL channel name VAL Alf	0

COL title VAL Barbie Girl COL performer VAL Ely Bruna	COL video title VAL VinyLiberator-Percy Faith Orchestra-Mountain High\, Valley Low.mp4 COL description VAL This piece\, Mountain High\, Valley Low\, from The Percy Faith Orchestra's Shangri La album is an awesome\, really dynamic performance by a full orchestra. The record is over 50 years old and has a high amount of surface noise. The extreme detail of the music can be heard\, despite the surface noise.  I've been working to reduce surface noise pickup and have exhausted all the techniques I know of to reduce that noise. That AT92ECD cartridge I use has a .3 X .7 mil stylus and my pre amp system makes no compromises in high frequency response or low noise performance\, so I would especially appreciate suggestions from anyone who may be able to hear and point me to it's cause. Thank you.  UPDATE: 1/14/2012 I've worked up a satisfactory deep-groove cleaning system. I'll be posting very clean records soon and plan to produce a video about my wacky method.

COL title VAL I Guess That's Why They Call It the Blues COL performer VAL Elton John with Mary J. Blige	COL video title VAL Elly Lapp - Ich weiß es wird einmal ein Wunder gescheh'n COL description VAL Elly Lapp Ganz nah  Genre: Deutsch-Pop\, Chanson\, Schlager   „Eine Stimme die unter die Haut geht.  Eindringlich\, lasziv\, ganz nah."   Elly Lapp liebt die Brückenschläge. Für sie sind UFA-Schlager und Popmusik keine  unarrangierbaren Gegensätze\, sondern interpretatorische Herausforderung. Dabei ist eine sehr moderne CD entstanden\,  die gleichzeitig sehr intensiv und sehr persönlich ist. Viel näher geht`s nicht.   Es waren große Songs -- es sind große Songs. Dazu leistet eine interessante Interpretin ihren Beitrag. Elly Lapp. Die studierte Schauspielerin und Sängerin tourt mit eigenen Programmen durch Deutschland -- und sie war die Stimme des Titelsongs der erfolgreichen ARD-Fernsehserie „Kir Royal".  „Der Wind hat mir ein Lied erzählt" - gleichzeitig erste Single - und „Ich steh` im Regen" sind Versuche einer ungewöhnlichen Verbindung von UFA - HIT und POPSOUND. Zarah Leander machte einst diese Songs zu Welterfolgen. Damals hatten die Autoren wohl nie eine Umsetzung mit rockigen Gitarren oder Saxophon im Auge. Hier geben die modernen Instrumente\, wie das gesamte Pop- Arrangement\, eine ganz neue Farbe -- voller Intensität.  Doch die CD von Elly Lapp zeigt die großen Filmhits nicht nur im Popgewand\, sondern auch sehr sparsam\, kunstvoll arrangiert\, als Chansons mit großer interpretatorischer Tiefe.  z.B." Wenn ich mir was wünschen dürfte" und - vor allem - „Der Nowack lässt mich nicht verkommen" -\, ein wahrer Kultsong\, 1959 geschrieben\, sofort auf Schallplatte aufgenommen\, kurzerhand von einem Münchner Gericht verboten und wieder eingestampft -- eine echte Rarität für jedes Rundfunk- und Privatarchiv!

COL title VAL The Big Hurt COL performer VAL Scott Walker	COL video title VAL Ruth Brown - Never Let Me Go COL description VAL A Good Day For The Blues ....Ruth Brown (1928-2006) was a rhythm & blues singer-songwriter\, record producer\, composer and actress noted for bringing a pop music style to rhythm & blues music. Backed by a bevy of New Orleans jazz and soul vets\, Brown delivers a series of horn-inflected\, indigo ballads like "Never Let Me Go\," "True\," and "The Richest One" that unearth the blues with an unruffled dignity reminiscent of Nina Simone or a less fragile Billie Holiday. On most of the rest of the material\, Brown invokes her Broadway experience to become the archetypal blues mama who "don't take no mess." In that vein\, "H.B.'s Funky Fable" is a humorous talk-sung tale for kids of all ages\, and "Cabbage Head" resurrects the minstrel-vaudeville days of Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith with hilarious aplomb\, as Brown nails the bawdy vernacular and trumpeter Abram Wilson spools out brassy asides that evoke the period perfectly.

COL title VAL I Want to Tell You COL performer VAL Jeff Lynne	COL video title VAL Alf Cranner - Sjømannsvise - 1966 COL description VAL Sjømannsvise av Harald Sverdrup ble tonesatt av visekunstneren Alf Cranner.   Visa ble presentert under turneen «Vers og viiiiiiser. Lyriske utskeielser ved Harald Sverdrup og Alf Cranner» i 1966\, og utgitt på LP året samme høst.   Sjømannsvise har blitt en av Cranners mest folkekjære viser\, og den har kommet på flere plateinnspillinger siden.   Den svenske trubaduren Cornelis Vreeswijk lagde en egen tekstversjon av Sjømannsvise som han kalt Ågren.   Han oppgav opprinnelig melodien som «norsk folketone»\, men førte opp Cranner som komponist da han gav ut visa på plata Poem\, ballader och lite blues i 1970.  En sjømannsvise er en vise om sjømenn og livet ombord\, eller en vise som er populær blant sjømenn.   Sjømannsviser kan deles i to grupper. Sjantier som var arbeidssangen ombord på seilskutene og frivaktsviser som var populære sanger blant sjømenn. COL channel name VAL Cauldron20	0

The record was released in June 1979 on Optional Music with "The Man with the Dogs" as the b-side. The title track was re-recorded for the band's first album\, Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables (1980)\, and the version that appeared on this single\, as well as the single's b-side\, are available on the rarities album Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death (1987).  The lyrics were written by Jello Biafra and John Greenway\, and Biafra composed the music in one of his rare attempts at composing on bass.  This song was featured in the video game Tony Hawk's American Wasteland and as a downloadable song in the Rock Band series. It is also sampled in a song by the dance-punk/big beat trio The Prodigy\, "Dead Ken Beats". The song was also featured in the 2010 film The Social Network.  Meaning  The title is an allusion to the first (and no longer sung) stanza of the national anthem of Germany\, which begins with the words "Deutschland\, Deutschland über alles." (literally\, "Germany\, Germany above all.")  The song focuses on Jerry Brown\, the Governor of California 1975-1983 and 2011--present\, and is sung from his perspective. An imaginary Brown outlines a hippie-fascist vision for America\, in which his "suede denim secret police" kill un-cool people with "organic poison gas" chambers. Lines such as "Serpent's egg already hatched" (a reference to a line from William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar) comment on the corrosive nature of power. The line "now it is 1984" refers to the totalitarian regime of George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four\, describing a future (from 1979) where Jerry Brown has become President Brown presiding over secret police and gas chambers.  Cover versions  Blue Ribbon Glee Club regularly perform their version of the song.  The song was updated by The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy when they released a cover version in 1992 on the album Hypocrisy is the Greatest Legacy. They replaced references to Jerry Brown with references to Pete Wilson.  The song was also widely known in Poland (as "Kalifornia Ponad Wszystko") thanks to the cover by Polish rocker Kazik Staszewski with his band Kazik Na Żywo.  Hasidic New Wave perform a remake of the song on their 1999 album\, Kabalogy. In their version\, titled "Giuliani Über Alles"\, Jerry Brown is replaced by former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani.  The Delgados cover the song in their Peel Sessions CD set.  Six Feet Under do a cover the song on their Graveyard Classics album.  The black metal band Mayhem also covered the song.  Deceased covered the song on their punk covers album Rotten to the Core.  The hardcore band Ceremony has covered the song.  The Who Boys have done a mashup of "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" by Gil Scott-Heron called "Revolution Über Alles".  John Linnell and his band The Statesmen covered it live at least once during his "State Songs" tour\, choosing to perform it because it mentioned the state of California.  Dramarama has recorded a version\, updated in 2003 about California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger... "You will lift weights in school".  A 1986 live recording focused on Ronald Reagan on the album Mutiny On The Bay with live recordings from 1982 and 1986.  Jayne County covered the song with She Wolves about California's Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The green vinyl single was released under artist name Jayne County Meets The She Wolves by the German label Trash 2001.  Mexican death metal band Brujería covers Dead Kennedys with the song "California Uber Aztlan" in 2010. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

COL title VAL Just a Little Lovin' (Will Go a Long Way) COL performer VAL Chris Scruggs	COL video title VAL Cliff Richard - We Don't Talk Anymore (1979) COL description VAL Britain's answer to Elvis Presley\, Richard (born Harry Webb) dominated the pre-Beatles British pop scene in the late '50s and early '60s. An accomplished singer with a genuine feel for the music\, Richard's artistic legacy is nonetheless meager\, as he was quickly steered toward a middle-of-the-road pop direction. Several of his late-'50s recordings\, however\, were genuinely exciting Presley-esque rockers -- especially his first hit\, "Move It" (1958) -- and gave British teenagers their first taste of genuine homegrown rock & roll talent. Backed by the Shadows -- clean-cut instrumental virtuosos who became legends of their own -- Richard embarked on a truly awesome string of hit singles in Britain\, scoring no less than 43 Top 20 hits between 1958 and 1969. One of these\, although it was by no means one of the more successful\, was an actual Mick Jagger/Keith Richards composition (the ballad "Blue Turns to Grey").  In his homeland\, Richard's popularity was diminished only slightly by the rise of the Beatles\, but in his prime\, he had a much rougher time in the U.S.\, hitting the Top 40 only three times (with "Living Doll" in 1959\, "It's All in the Game" in 1963\, and "Devil Woman" in 1976). Richard belatedly cracked the U.S. Top Ten in 1976 with "Devil Woman\," and racked up a few other hits ("We Don't Talk Anymore\," "Dreaming\," "A Little in Love") in a mainstream pop/rock style. He remains an institution in Britain\, where he is one of the nation's most popular all-around entertainers of all time. ~ Richie Unterberger\, All Music Guide _____________________________________ In 2008\, Richard's 50th year in music\, will see the release of the 8CD box set\, And They Said It Wouldn't Last (My 50 Years In Music). In September\, a single celebrating his 50 years in pop music\, titled * Thank you for a Lifetime has been released. On the 14th of September 2008 Thank You For A Lifetime reached No.3 on the UK music charts\, which gives Cliff a Top 3 hit in each of his six decades as a singer. On 2nd November 2008\, British newspaper The Mail on Sunday gave away a free promotional CD entitled '50th Anniversary' containing 12 tracks picked by Sir Cliff himself.

COL title VAL C'era un ragazzo che come me amava i Beatles e i Rolling Stones COL performer VAL Lucio Dalla	COL video title VAL Les Terribles - Ce n'est pas une vie COL description VAL Ready for an amazing 60's dance party? Well\, don't forget to bring this platter to the DJ! This band from Paris\, France plays an incredible mix of 60's garage-punk & GoGo Beat and now finally returns with their second longplayer 'Ils sont formidables!'. The band that includes members of THE NO TALENTS\, LES SYNAPSES\, DUTRONC\, CECILIA UND DIE SAUERKRAUTS & OPERATION S goes back to the sound of the French Beat & Roll when it was bitten by the Big Bad British Bug back in 1965. Imagine how THEM\, THE SMALL FACES\, THE YARDBIRDS or the early STONES would've sound if they were from France\, never turned professionals and Van Morrison\, Keith Relf or Mike Jagger were chicks. All the songs are in French\, with that glamorous 'mademoiselle' accent! The band could've been described best as the great french sixties rock band that should have existed but never did. Owing to cultural impediments and lame business practices\, there were very few outstanding french rockers from that period. Ronnie Bird\, Larry Greco\, and a dozen others you've never heard of: LES TERRIBLES cover them all\, and every song makes you wanna dance. The band rounds out their set with some originals\, as well as their own french versions of some great foreign songs that never got adapted before\, all done with a perfect ear for the style. Fronted by the charming and talented chanteuse Rudie this hard-working orchestre delivers the groove that gets the dance floor moving to the Swim\, the Jerk\, and the Hully-Gully. Les Terribles are sur scene ! ((Jon Dragueur) A Top 10 forever-must have this one is. What more can we tell you? COL channel name VAL Matthew East	0

Man gave names to all the animals\, In the beginning\, a long time ago.  He saw an animal that liked to growl\, Big furry paws and he liked to howl. Great big furry back and furry hair\, I think I'll call it a bear.  Man gave names to all the animals\, In the beginning\, in the beginning. Man gave names to all the animals\, In the beginning\, a long time ago.  He saw an animal up on the hill\, Chewing up so much grass until she was filled. He saw milk coming out but didn't know how\, He said I think I'll call it a cow.  Man gave names to all the animals\, In the beginning\, in the beginning. Man gave names to all the animals\, In the beginning\, a long time ago.  He saw an animal that liked to snort\, Horns on his head and they weren't too short. And it looked like there was nothing he couldn't pull\, He said I think I'll call it a bull.  Man gave names to all the animals\, In the beginning\, in the beginning. Man gave names to all the animals\, In the beginning\, a long time ago.  He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail\, Real dirty face and a curly tail. He wasn't too small\, he wasn't too big\, He said I think I'll call it a pig.  Man gave names to all the animals\, In the beginning\, in the beginning. Man gave names to all the animals\, In the beginning\, a long time ago.  Next animal that he did meet\, Had wool on his back and hooves on his feet. Eating grass on a mountain side so steep\, He said I'm gonna call that one a sheep.  Man gave names to all the animals\, In the beginning\, in the beginning. Man gave names to all the animals\, In the beginning\, a long time ago.  He saw an animal as smooth as glass\, Slithering his way through the grass. He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake\, Ahhh.

COL title VAL Wonderful Land COL performer VAL Hank Marvin	COL video title VAL The Animals It's My Life COL description VAL NO COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT INTENDED. COPYRIGHTS RESERVED BY COPYRIGHT OWNER.This video is used only for non-profit usage and publishing. The Animals were an English music group of the 1960s formed in Newcastle upon Tyne during the early part of the decade\, and later relocated to London. Known for their gritty\, bluesy  sound and deep-voiced frontman Eric Burdon -- as exemplified by their number one signature song "The House of the Rising Sun" as well as by hits such as "We Gotta Get Out of This Place" and "It's My Life" -- the band balanced tough\, rock-edged pop singles against rhythm and blues-oriented album material. They became known in the U.S. as part of the British Invasion.  The Animals underwent numerous personnel changes in the mid-1960s and suffered from poor business management. Under the name Eric Burdon and the Animals\, they moved to California and achieved commercial success as a psychedelic rock band\, before disbanding at the end of the decade. Altogether\, the group had ten Top Twenty hits in both the UK and U.S.  The original lineup had a brief comeback in 1977 and 1983. There have been several partial regroupings of the original era members since then under various names. The Animals were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.

COL title VAL Dear God COL performer VAL Thierry Amiel	COL video title VAL "Warren Smith ~ Rock 'n' Roll Ruby" - Sun 239 1956 COL description VAL Warren Smith - Rock n Roll Ruby on Sun 239. Hope You ENJOY!!! Warren Smith (February 7\, 1932 -- January 30\, 1980) was an American rockabilly and country music singer and guitarist. Smith was born in Humphreys County\, Mississippi to Iola and Willie Warren Smith\, who divorced when he was young. He was raised by his maternal grandparents in Louise\, Mississippi where they had a small farm and dry goods store. Smith took up the guitar to while away his evenings while in the United States Air Force stationed in San Antonio\, Texas. By the time of his discharge from the service\, he had decided to make a career of music. He moved to West Memphis\, Arkansas and auditioned\, successfully\, to play the Cotton Club\, a local hot spot. Steel guitarist Stan Kessler\, who was playing at that nightclub with the Snearly Ranch Boys\, immediately spotted Smith's potential and took him to Sun Records to audition for Sam Phillips\, with the Snearly Ranch Boys providing backup. Phillips liked what he heard\, and decided that "Rock & Roll Ruby"\, a song credited to Johnny Cash\, would be Smith's first record. (Smith later claimed that "Rock & Roll Ruby" was actually written by George Jones and sold to Cash for $40.) Smith recorded it on February 5\, 1956. Phillips\, who was hedging his bets over whether rock and roll would maintain its popularity\, released that record with a country crooner\, aptly named "I'd Rather Be Safe Than Sorry"\, on the flip side. By May 26\, "Rock & Roll Ruby" had hit No. 1 on the local pop charts. Smith's first record for Sun went on to outsell the first Sun releases by Elvis Presley\, Johnny Cash and Carl Perkins. In August 1956\, Smith went back to the Sun Records studio to record his second release\, "Ubangi Stomp". This infectious rocker had an incorrect lyric including an African chief with the syntax of a movie Indian. For the B side\, Smith recorded the classic ballad "Black Jack David". This song\, which originated in early 18th-century Britain and survived in various forms in the mountains of the American south\, may be the oldest song ever recorded by a rock and roll performer. Although a resounding artistic success\, it did not sell as well as Smith's debut. In 1957\, Smith recorded "So Long\, I'm Gone"\, a song written by Roy Orbison\, and it did become Smith's biggest hit at Sun\, peaking at No. 74 nationally (Billboard). But Sun had no cash to promote it at the same time as Sam Phillips put every dollar Sun had behind Jerry Lee Lewis' "Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin On". Although Smith continued to make rockabilly records for Sun\, including a cover version of Slim Harpo's "Got Love If Your Want It" (recorded in October 1957)\, these records did not do well commercially. Toward the end of 1958\, Smith\, seeing his future in country music\, cut a final record for Sun\, a cover version of Don Gibson's "Sweet Sweet Girl". In spite of a review in Billboard calling it "ultra commercial"\, this record also failed to sell. Like other artists such as Sonny Burgess\, Hayden Thompson\, Billy Lee Riley and Ray Harris\, chart success largely eluded him. Smith then decided to leave Sun Records.

COL title VAL Dixie Fried COL performer VAL Carl Perkins	COL video title VAL Lena Horne -- Take Love Easy COL description VAL Lena Horne\, Lena Mary Calhoun Horne (Brooklyn\, 30 de junio de 1917 - 9 de mayo de 20101 )\, más conocida como Lena Horne\, fue una legendaria actriz y cantante afroestadounidense de jazz y música popular. Su carrera\, tanto como artista de nightclub como de intérprete de discos para diversas compañías\, abarca más de sesenta años\, desde los años treinta a los noventa del siglo XX.  Sus padres se separaron cuando tenía dos años y fue criada por sus abuelos. Mitad afroestadounidense y mitad indígena estadounidense\, su madre fue la hija del inventor Samuel R. Scottron y es descendiente de John Caldwell Calhoun\, y su tío Frank Horne fue asesor del presidente Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Debutó como corista a los 14 años\, pasando a integrar las filas del célebre Cotton Club de Harlem donde actuaban Duke Ellington\, Billie Holiday\, Louis Armstrong y Ethel Waters que la impactó con la canción Stormy Weather. Se dio a conocer en el mundo del jazz en la segunda mitad de la década de 1930\, cantando en diversas big bands\, especialmente en la de Noble Sissle (1938)\, época en la que iniciaria su carrera cinematográfica. En 1941 se incorpora a la banda de Charlie Barnet\, consiguiendo un éxito discográfico con el tema "Good for a nothing Joe"\, y después actuaría asiduamente con la banda del pianista Teddy Wilson.  Trabajó en 16 películas y varios cortos entre 1938 y 1978. Su más famosa aparición y canción distintiva fue\, casualmente\, en Stormy Weather de 19433 y en la película Cabin in the Sky de Vincente Minnelli junto a la ya veterana Ethel Waters y Cab Calloway. Debió haber encarnado a Julie en Show Boat pero debido a su color el papel fue cedido a su amiga Ava Gardner\, quien fue doblada en las canciones. Su última aparición fue The Wiz como Glenda The Good Witch junto a Michael Jackson y Diana Ross.  Actuó también en Broadway\, conquistando una nominación al Tony en 1957 por Jamaica. En 1980 regresó triunfalmente (a los 63 años) en su propio espectáculo Lena Horne: The Lady and Her Music en 1981-1982 producido por Quincy Jones por el que obtuvo un Premio Tony. Trabajó asiduamente en radio y televisión\, en el show de Judy Garland\, Bing Crosby\, Frank Sinatra y The Muppet Show.

COL title VAL Mother & Child Reunion COL performer VAL Wailing Souls	COL video title VAL Randy California / Kapt. Kopter &  The (Fabulous) Twirly Birds - Mother And Child Reunion COL description VAL Randy California (наст. имя Randy Craig Wolfe; Лос-Анджелес\, 20 февраля 1951 - 2 января 1997) был гитарист\, вокалист и автор песен рок-группы Spirit\, созданной в 1967 году. Входит в список "100 лучших гитаристов мира" по версии журнала Classic Rock. Сценический псевдоним "Рэнди Калифорния" дал ему (в 15 лет) Джими Хендрикс\, чтобы можно было отличить от другого Рэнди в тогдашней группе Хендрикса Jimmy James and the Blue Flames (второго Рэнди Хендрикс называл "Рэнди Техас"). После ухода из группы Spirit (июль 1971) Рэнди начал сольную карьеру\, подписал контракт с Epic и выпустил осенью 1972 года альбом Kapt. Kopter and the (Fabulous) Twirly Birds. Музыка - Хендриксо-подобная\, с импровизациями\, кроме того здесь на некоторых треках играет басист Noel Redding (ex-Jimi Hendrix Experience). Следует отметить\, что на этой пластинке некоторые известные музыканты записаны под псевдонимами. С Эдом Кэссиди (своим отчимом) и басистом Ларри Найтом (Larry «Fuzzy» Knight) он провёл в Европе гастроли в поддержку своей пластинки. Но не совсем удачные\, так как Калифорния оказался неважным промоутером... Трио\, кроме того\, подготовило концептуальный альбом Potatoland\, но лейбл его отверг и Калифорния на некоторое время ушёл из музыкального бизнеса\, поселившись на Гавайях.

In retrospect\, it would have appeared that the Souls  may have been a decade ahead of time\, b'cos head today\, Live On sounds amazingly current with it's mix of roots\, funk\, soul\, jazz and pop \, and while it is true that it might be the least Jamaicans sounding of their albums\, with pedigree of crack island session players like Sly & Robbie\, Dwight Pinkney\, Sticky Thompson and Earl Lindo all over the tracks..."

A real "Jazz Oddity" - Federica Zammarchi "Jazz Oddity"\, consists in eleven re-arrangements of songs of David Bowie. Its concept came up a few years ago\, when she needed to mix together her two main musical loves\, namely jazz and 70's rock\, both so important during her forming years. It was recorded with an Italian all- star band and it showcases a uniquely innovative sound\, slightly influenced by european bands like the Esbjörn Svensson Trio\, coining a new genre definition called "PowerJazz".

COL title VAL The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance COL performer VAL Elliott Sharp	COL video title VAL Les Terribles - Ce n'est pas une vie COL description VAL Ready for an amazing 60's dance party? Well\, don't forget to bring this platter to the DJ! This band from Paris\, France plays an incredible mix of 60's garage-punk & GoGo Beat and now finally returns with their second longplayer 'Ils sont formidables!'. The band that includes members of THE NO TALENTS\, LES SYNAPSES\, DUTRONC\, CECILIA UND DIE SAUERKRAUTS & OPERATION S goes back to the sound of the French Beat & Roll when it was bitten by the Big Bad British Bug back in 1965. Imagine how THEM\, THE SMALL FACES\, THE YARDBIRDS or the early STONES would've sound if they were from France\, never turned professionals and Van Morrison\, Keith Relf or Mike Jagger were chicks. All the songs are in French\, with that glamorous 'mademoiselle' accent! The band could've been described best as the great french sixties rock band that should have existed but never did. Owing to cultural impediments and lame business practices\, there were very few outstanding french rockers from that period. Ronnie Bird\, Larry Greco\, and a dozen others you've never heard of: LES TERRIBLES cover them all\, and every song makes you wanna dance. The band rounds out their set with some originals\, as well as their own french versions of some great foreign songs that never got adapted before\, all done with a perfect ear for the style. Fronted by the charming and talented chanteuse Rudie this hard-working orchestre delivers the groove that gets the dance floor moving to the Swim\, the Jerk\, and the Hully-Gully. Les Terribles are sur scene ! ((Jon Dragueur) A Top 10 forever-must have this one is. What more can we tell you? COL channel name VAL Matthew East	0

I lay there in the sun And felt it caressing my face As I fell asleep And dreamed. I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie And that I was the star of the movie. This really blew my mind\, The fact that me\, An overfed\, long-haired\, leaping gnome\, Should be the star of a Hollywood movie. Hmm\, but there I was. I was taken to a place\, The hall of the mountain king. I stood high upon a mountain top\, Naked to the world\, In front of every kind of girl. There was long ones\, tall ones\, short ones\, brown ones\, Black ones\, round ones\, big ones\, crazy ones. Out of the middle Came a lady. She whispered in my ear Something crazy. She said\, Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl." I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back As she disappeared\, But soon she returned. In her hand was a bottle of wine\, In the other\, a glass. She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass And raised it to her lips And\, just before she drank it\, She said\, Take the wine\, take that girl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl." Take that pearl\, yeah. It's on girl\, all you gotta do is spill that wine\, spill that wine. Let me feel\, let me feel fine\, yeah\, yeah. Spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, take that pearl.

The record was released in June 1979 on Optional Music with "The Man with the Dogs" as the b-side. The title track was re-recorded for the band's first album\, Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables (1980)\, and the version that appeared on this single\, as well as the single's b-side\, are available on the rarities album Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death (1987).  The lyrics were written by Jello Biafra and John Greenway\, and Biafra composed the music in one of his rare attempts at composing on bass.  This song was featured in the video game Tony Hawk's American Wasteland and as a downloadable song in the Rock Band series. It is also sampled in a song by the dance-punk/big beat trio The Prodigy\, "Dead Ken Beats". The song was also featured in the 2010 film The Social Network.  Meaning  The title is an allusion to the first (and no longer sung) stanza of the national anthem of Germany\, which begins with the words "Deutschland\, Deutschland über alles." (literally\, "Germany\, Germany above all.")  The song focuses on Jerry Brown\, the Governor of California 1975-1983 and 2011--present\, and is sung from his perspective. An imaginary Brown outlines a hippie-fascist vision for America\, in which his "suede denim secret police" kill un-cool people with "organic poison gas" chambers. Lines such as "Serpent's egg already hatched" (a reference to a line from William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar) comment on the corrosive nature of power. The line "now it is 1984" refers to the totalitarian regime of George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four\, describing a future (from 1979) where Jerry Brown has become President Brown presiding over secret police and gas chambers.  Cover versions  Blue Ribbon Glee Club regularly perform their version of the song.  The song was updated by The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy when they released a cover version in 1992 on the album Hypocrisy is the Greatest Legacy. They replaced references to Jerry Brown with references to Pete Wilson.  The song was also widely known in Poland (as "Kalifornia Ponad Wszystko") thanks to the cover by Polish rocker Kazik Staszewski with his band Kazik Na Żywo.  Hasidic New Wave perform a remake of the song on their 1999 album\, Kabalogy. In their version\, titled "Giuliani Über Alles"\, Jerry Brown is replaced by former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani.  The Delgados cover the song in their Peel Sessions CD set.  Six Feet Under do a cover the song on their Graveyard Classics album.  The black metal band Mayhem also covered the song.  Deceased covered the song on their punk covers album Rotten to the Core.  The hardcore band Ceremony has covered the song.  The Who Boys have done a mashup of "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" by Gil Scott-Heron called "Revolution Über Alles".  John Linnell and his band The Statesmen covered it live at least once during his "State Songs" tour\, choosing to perform it because it mentioned the state of California.  Dramarama has recorded a version\, updated in 2003 about California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger... "You will lift weights in school".  A 1986 live recording focused on Ronald Reagan on the album Mutiny On The Bay with live recordings from 1982 and 1986.  Jayne County covered the song with She Wolves about California's Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The green vinyl single was released under artist name Jayne County Meets The She Wolves by the German label Trash 2001.  Mexican death metal band Brujería covers Dead Kennedys with the song "California Uber Aztlan" in 2010. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

COL title VAL Some Girls Have All the Luck COL performer VAL Bette Bright and The Illuminations	COL video title VAL Jerry Lee Lewis - Let's Talk About Us COL description VAL Jerry Lee Lewis (born September 29\, 1935) is an American singer-songwriter\, musician\, and pianist\, who is often known by his nickname of The Killer and is often viewed as "rock & roll's first great wild man." As an early pioneer of rock and roll music\, in 1956 Lewis made his first recordings at Sun Records in Memphis. "Crazy Arms" sold 300\,000 copies in the South\, but it was his 1957 hit "Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On" that shot Lewis to fame worldwide. Lewis followed this when he recorded songs such as "Great Balls of Fire"\, "Breathless" and "High School Confidential". However\, Lewis's rock and roll career faltered in the wake of his marriage to his 13-year-old cousin when he was 22. He had little success in the charts following the scandal and his popularity quickly faded. His live performance fees plummeted from $10\,000 per night to $250. In the meantime he was determined to gain back some of his popularity. During the early 1960s he didn't have much chart success with few exceptions such as "What'd I Say". His live performances at this time were increasingly wild and energetic. His album Live at the Star Club\, Hamburg from 1964 is often regarded by many music journalists and fans as one of the wildest and greatest rock and roll concert albums ever. After recording songs such as "I'm on Fire" for several years with little success\, in 1968 Lewis made a transition into country music and had hits with songs such as "Another Place\, Another Time". This reignited his career and throughout the late 1960s and 1970s he regularly topped the country-western charts. His No. 1 country hits included "To Make Love Sweeter For You"\, "There Must Be More to Love Than This"\, "Would You Take Another Chance on Me" and "Me and Bobby McGee" COL channel name VAL Music Legends Book	0

Performed by The Crazy World of Arthur Brown\, it was released as a single and on the band's debut album\, also called The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. The single made #1 in the UK (in August 1968) and Canada. In October\, it made #2 in the US Billboard charts and #19 in Australia. It also made #6 in the Netherlands. "Fire" sold over one million copies\, and was awarded a gold disc.  The song is an example of the psychedelic rock of the period\, though its lack of guitars or bass guitar distinguished it from many of its contemporaries. The lead instrument in this case was Vincent Crane's Hammond electronic organ\, augmented by an orchestral section featuring prominent brass. The singer's opening proclamation of himself as "the god of hellfire" became a lasting epithet. The song's other memorable line is "You're Gonna Burn!!". The song ends with the sound of a wind from hell.  During live performances and in the black and white promotional television clip\, Brown performed the song wearing a burning helmet. The helmet was improvised with a leather skull cap onto which was bolted a metal dish that held lighter fluid or petrol. As the cap was not insulated\, the heat from the burning fuel quickly conducted through the fixing bolt to the top of Brown's head\, causing him considerable pain.  Two studio mixes of "Fire" have been officially released\, one in stereo and one in mono. The mono mix features no brass. Both versions are included on the CD reissue of The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. The single B-side\, "Rest Cure"\, was another track from the album.  Credit for the composition of "Fire" on the original vinyl single was to Arthur Brown and Vincent Crane only; however\, Mike Finesilver and Peter Ker successfully sued for co-credit and royalties based on melodic similarities to their song "Baby\, You're a Long Way Behind".  The song is briefly featured in the films Hot Fuzz (2007) and The Boat That Rocked (2009). It is also referenced in Julie Hearn's debut novel Follow Me Down\, and was used in the episode "Burn Victim" of My Name Is Earl.  Cover versions  The Ventures covered the song on their 1969 album Underground Fire. Lizzy Mercier Descloux covered "Fire" on her album Press Color (1979)\, drastically changing the mood and style of the track. Pete Townshend\, the single's associate producer\, covered "Fire" as a member of The Who on his 1989 album The Iron Man: A Musical. Cirith Ungol covered the song on their 1991 album Paradise Lost. The Prodigy sampled the track for "Fire/Jericho"\, which was otherwise a completely different song\, on their 1992 album Experience. Emerson\, Lake & Palmer covered the song on their 1993 4-disc compilation album The Return of the Manticore. German dark electro act AmGod covered the song several times. The most well-known version is "Fire v.2" featured on the 1994 album Half Rotten and Decayed. Though it was not a true 'cover'\, Marilyn Manson's "Lunchbox" (1995) heavily samples "Fire". UK doom metal band Cathedral covered the song on their 1996 EP Hopkins (The Witchfinder General). Die Krupps covered the song on their 1997 album Paradise Now. Dutch death metal band God Dethroned covered the song on their 1997 album The Grand Grimoire. Ozzy Osbourne included a version on his 2005 album Under Cover. The song is used in one episode of Series 3 of Monkey Dust (2005) as the Paedofinder General burns the wrongly accused paedophiles with this music in the background\, complete with bastardised lyrics. US Hip hop duo Cunninlynguists sampled the song for "Hellfire" on their 2006 album A Piece of Strange. Leningrad Cowboys covered the song in a metal style and included it on their 2006 album Zombie's Paradise. Appears in the musical Disco Inferno\, when the character Duke reveals himself to be Satan in disguise.[citation needed] Death Grips\, an experimental hip hop group backed by drummer Zach Hill\, sampled "Fire" in their song "Lord of the Game".

In June 1987 Gerald Arthur Friend picked up a 14-year-old female friend after leaving a concert at the Tacoma Dome. Upon trying to exit the car the girl was handcuffed and held hostage at knife point. The girl was taken to a mobile home where she was tortured and raped with various objects for two days. She was also threatened with a blowtorch."  we recorded our cover of "polly" for SPIN magazine's "Newermind" tribute/compilation to mark the 20th anniversary of "Nevermind" in september. michael (who a lot of you have seen as the new drummer of my touring band\, the grand theft orchestra) produced/engineered and played bass on the recording.  this is a video me (glockenspiel\, vocals\, Taurus bass pedal)\, chad raines (banjo\, percussion)\, and michael (bass\, percussion) shot in new haven\, CT on a super-tight budget with the help of some actors and filmmakers from around new york and yale.   we filmed it in one day in november...i wrote the script and michael directed the video. blake\, who plays the angel\, is also on the cover of the first dolls' album "a is for accident"...looking very different in a long red dress.  so many people loaned us stuff and worked for free on this video to keep us under budget - THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH.  x afp ________________  FULL CREDITS & THANK YOUS...  song by NIRVANA  starring CHRISTOPHER M.

COL title VAL Moonlight Bay COL performer VAL Claude Thornhill and His Orchestra	COL video title VAL Staccatos - Police on my back COL description VAL The Staccatos are a South African band formed in November 1961 by Brian Le Gassick. The original line-up consisted of Brian le Gassick – lead vocals\, guitar\, John Leach – lead guitar\, Willie van der Walt – bass and Ian Miller – drums. In 1962 Leach and van der Walt were replaced by Richard Crouse – guitar\, Jimmy Routledge – bass and Billy Andrews – vocals\, harmonica (Billy later became one half of the duo the “Dream Merchants” with Billy Forrest). In 1964 the Staccatos won the Transvaal Merseyside Contest\, which included a recording contract with EMI. They supported Peter and Gordon on their tour of South Africa in 1965.  In 1966 Steve Lonsdale took over the lead vocals\, and Richard Crouse married Wanda Arletti who joined the group for a tour of Zambia. In 1967 Eddie Boyle – bass\, and Ronnie Cline – organ\, joined the group. In 1968 Billy Forrest approached the group to record “Cry to me” for the film “Katrina”. This song became their biggest hit\, reaching number 1 on the South African Top 20 in 1969 and charting for a massive 38 weeks\, earning them a double gold disc.  In 1969 John Elliot – sax\, joined the group and in 1970 Ivor Black – drums and Peter Vee – lead vocals (Steve Lonsdale left for America).  This song is off the album “He Was A Friend Of Mine” released in 1970. COL channel name VAL keurspel (Leon Rossouw)	0

COL title VAL These Hands COL performer VAL Jimmy Dean	COL video title VAL Cliff Richard - We Don't Talk Anymore (1979) COL description VAL Britain's answer to Elvis Presley\, Richard (born Harry Webb) dominated the pre-Beatles British pop scene in the late '50s and early '60s. An accomplished singer with a genuine feel for the music\, Richard's artistic legacy is nonetheless meager\, as he was quickly steered toward a middle-of-the-road pop direction. Several of his late-'50s recordings\, however\, were genuinely exciting Presley-esque rockers -- especially his first hit\, "Move It" (1958) -- and gave British teenagers their first taste of genuine homegrown rock & roll talent. Backed by the Shadows -- clean-cut instrumental virtuosos who became legends of their own -- Richard embarked on a truly awesome string of hit singles in Britain\, scoring no less than 43 Top 20 hits between 1958 and 1969. One of these\, although it was by no means one of the more successful\, was an actual Mick Jagger/Keith Richards composition (the ballad "Blue Turns to Grey").  In his homeland\, Richard's popularity was diminished only slightly by the rise of the Beatles\, but in his prime\, he had a much rougher time in the U.S.\, hitting the Top 40 only three times (with "Living Doll" in 1959\, "It's All in the Game" in 1963\, and "Devil Woman" in 1976). Richard belatedly cracked the U.S. Top Ten in 1976 with "Devil Woman\," and racked up a few other hits ("We Don't Talk Anymore\," "Dreaming\," "A Little in Love") in a mainstream pop/rock style. He remains an institution in Britain\, where he is one of the nation's most popular all-around entertainers of all time. ~ Richie Unterberger\, All Music Guide _____________________________________ In 2008\, Richard's 50th year in music\, will see the release of the 8CD box set\, And They Said It Wouldn't Last (My 50 Years In Music). In September\, a single celebrating his 50 years in pop music\, titled * Thank you for a Lifetime has been released. On the 14th of September 2008 Thank You For A Lifetime reached No.3 on the UK music charts\, which gives Cliff a Top 3 hit in each of his six decades as a singer. On 2nd November 2008\, British newspaper The Mail on Sunday gave away a free promotional CD entitled '50th Anniversary' containing 12 tracks picked by Sir Cliff himself.

Lyrics:  Seven lonely days  And a dozen towns ago I reached out one night  And you were gone Don't know why you'd run\,  What you're running to or from All I know is I want to bring you home  So I'm walking in the rain\,  Thumbing for a ride On this lonely Kentucky backroad I've loved you much too long And my love's too strong To let you go\, never knowing What went wrong  Kentucky rain keeps pouring down And up ahead's another town That I'll go walking thru With the rain in my shoes\, Searchin for you In the cold Kentucky rain\, In the cold Kentucky rain  Showed your photograph To some old gray bearded man Sitting on a bench Outside a gen'ral store They said 'Yes\, she's been here' But their memory wasn't clear Was it yesterday\, No\, wait the day before  So I fin'ly got a ride With a preacher man who asked 'Where you bound on such a dark afternoon?' As we drove on thru the rain As he listened I explained And he left me with a prayer That I'd find you    Disclaimer:  NO COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT INTENDED!

COL title VAL Who Is He and What Is He to You COL performer VAL Shaun Escoffery	COL video title VAL Bill Withers - Who Is He (And What Is He to You) COL description VAL Bill Withers - Who Is He (And What Is He to You)  William Harrison "Bill" Withers\, Jr. (born July 4\, 1938) is an American singer-songwriter and musician who performed and recorded from 1970 until 1985. Some of his best-known songs are "Lean on Me"\, "Ain't No Sunshine"\, "Use Me"\, "Just the Two of Us"\, "Lovely Day"\, and "Grandma's Hands". His life was recently the subject of the documentary film Still Bill. Withers was born the youngest of thirteen children in the small coal-mining town of Slab Fork\, West Virginia. Raised in nearby Beckley\, West Virginia\, Withers was thirteen years old when his father died. He enlisted with the United States Navy at age eighteen and served for nine years\, during which time he became interested in singing and writing songs. Soon after his discharge from the Navy in 1970\, he relocated to Los Angeles for a musical career. Withers worked as an assembler for several different companies\, including Douglas Aircraft Corporation\, while recording demo tapes with his own money\, shopping them around and performing in clubs at night. When he debuted with the song "Ain't No Sunshine" he refused to resign his job because of his belief that the music business was a fickle industry and that he was still a novice compared to other acts.  Lyrics  A man we passed just tried to stare me down  And when I looked at you\, you looked at the ground  I don't know who he is but I think that you do   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   I have something in my heart and in your eyes  Tell me he's not someone just passin' by  And when you cleared your throat was that your cue   Dag gummit dag  Who is he and what is he to you   Now when I add the sum of you and me  I get confused and I keep coming up with three  You're too much for one man but not enough for two   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Hey you tell me man don't have not much for intuition  That what you really think or are you wishin'  Before you wreck your old home be certain of the new   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you COL channel name VAL Alf	1

COL title VAL From the Morning COL performer VAL Andrea Corr	COL video title VAL Average White Band ~ If I Ever Lose This Heaven "1975" Funk COL description VAL Their self-effacing name to the contrary\, Average White Band was anything but -- one of the few white groups to cross the color line and achieve success and credibility playing funk\, with their tight\, fiery sound also belying their Scottish heritage\, evoking American R&B hotbeds like Detroit\, Memphis\, and Philadelphia instead. Singer/bassist Alan Gorrie\, guitarists Hamish Stuart and Onnie McIntyre\, tenor saxophonist Malcolm Duncan\, keyboardist/saxophonist Roger Ball\, and drummer Robbie McIntosh comprised the original Average White Band lineup. Veterans of numerous Scottish soul and jazz groups\, they made their debut in 1973 as the opening act at Eric Clapton's Rainbow Theatre comeback gig\, soon issuing their debut LP\, Show Your Hand\, to little notice. After adopting the abbreviated moniker AWB\, a year later the band issued their self-titled sophomore effort\, topping the American pop charts with the Arif Mardin-produced instrumental "Pick Up the Pieces." The record's mammoth success was nevertheless tempered by the September 23\, 1974 death of McIntosh\, who died at a Hollywood party after overdosing on heroin.  Cut the Cake Ex-Bloodstone drummer Steve Ferrone replaced McIntosh for AWB's third album\, 1975's Cut the Cake\, which scored a Top Ten hit with its title track as well as two other chart entries\, "If I Ever Lose This Heaven" and "School Boy Crush." (Put It Where You Want It\, issued later that same year\, was simply a retitled and repackaged Show Your Hand.) With 1976's Soul Searching\, the group reclaimed the full Average White Band name\, scoring their final Top 40 hit with "Queen of My Soul." Following the live Person to Person\, they issued Benny & Us\, a collaboration with soul legend Ben E. King. However\, after subsequent outings\, including 1978's Warmer Communications\, 1979's Feel No Fret\, and 1980's Shine\, failed to recapture the energy of AWB's peak\, the group dissolved in 1982\, with Ferrone later joining Duran Duran and Stuart recording with Paul McCartney. Gorrie\, Ball\, and McIntyre reformed Average White Band in 1989\, tapping vocalist Alex Ligertwood for their comeback effort Aftershock. Oft-sampled by hip-hop producers throughout the 1990s\, the group continued touring prior to releasing Soul Tattoo in 1996. The live album\, Face to Face\, followed three years later.

A real "Jazz Oddity" - Federica Zammarchi "Jazz Oddity"\, consists in eleven re-arrangements of songs of David Bowie. Its concept came up a few years ago\, when she needed to mix together her two main musical loves\, namely jazz and 70's rock\, both so important during her forming years. It was recorded with an Italian all- star band and it showcases a uniquely innovative sound\, slightly influenced by european bands like the Esbjörn Svensson Trio\, coining a new genre definition called "PowerJazz".

COL title VAL The Shape I'm In COL performer VAL Bo Diddley	COL video title VAL Henry Mancini -   Tiny Bubbles COL description VAL "I think there is a song out there to describe just about any situation."― Criss Jami ▼▼▼  HENRY MANCINI Enrico Nicola "Henry" Mancini was an American composer\, arranger and conductor\, who is best remembered for his film and television scores.  He won a record number of Grammy Awards\, plus a posthumous Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995. His best-known works include the jazz-idiom theme to The Pink Panther film series ("The Pink Panther Theme") and the theme to the Peter Gunn television series.  Mancini had a long collaboration with the film director Blake Edwards and won numerous Academy Awards for the songs in Edwards films\, including "Moon River" from Breakfast at Tiffany's\, "Days of Wine and Roses" and for the score to "Victor Victoria". Entering 1946\, Mancini became a pianist and arranger for the newly re-formed Glenn Miller Orchestra\, led by 'Everyman' Tex Beneke. After World War II\, Mancini broadened his skills in composition\, counterpoint\, harmony and orchestration during studies opening with the composers Ernst Krenek and Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco.  In 1952\, Mancini joined the Universal Pictures music department. During the next six years\, he contributed music to over 100 movies\, most notably The Creature from the Black Lagoon\, It Came from Outer Space\, Tarantula\, This Island Earth\, The Glenn Miller Story (for which he received his first Academy Award nomination)\, The Benny Goodman Story and Orson Welles' Touch of Evil. During this time\, he also wrote some popular songs. His first hit was a single by Guy Lombardo and His Royal Canadians titled I Won't Let You Out of My Heart. Mancini left Universal to work as an independent composer/arranger in 1958. Soon after\, he scored the television series Peter Gunn for writer/producer Blake Edwards. This was the genesis of a relationship in which Edwards and Mancini collaborated on 30 films over 35 years.  Along with Alex North\, Elmer Bernstein\, Leith Stevens and Johnny Mandel\, Henry Mancini was a pioneer of the inclusion of jazz elements in the late romantic orchestral film and TV scoring prevalent at the time. Mancini scored many TV movies\, including The Thorn Birds and The Shadow Box. He wrote many television themes\, including Mr. Lucky (starring John Vivyan and Ross Martin)\, NBC Mystery Movie\, What's Happening\, Tic Tac Dough (1990 version) and Once Is Not Enough. In the 1984--85 television season\, four series featured original Mancini themes: Newhart\, Hotel\, Remington Steele\, and Ripley's Believe It or Not. Mancini also composed the "Viewer Mail" theme for Late Night with David Letterman. Mancini composed the theme for NBC Nightly News used beginning in 1975\, and a different theme by him\, titled Salute to the President was used by NBC News for its election coverage (including primaries and conventions) from 1976 to 1992. Salute to the President was only published in a school-band arrangement\, although Mancini performed it frequently with symphony orchestras on his concert tours. Songs with music by Mancini were staples of the easy listening genre from the 1960s to the 1980s. Some of the artists who have recorded Mancini songs include Andy Williams\, Paul Anka\, Pat Boone\, Anita Bryant\, Jack Jones\, Frank Sinatra\, Perry Como\, Connie Francis\, Eydie Gorme\, Steve Lawrence\, Trini Lopez\, George Maharis\, Johnny Mathis\, Jerry Vale and Ray Conniff\, to name just a few.... Mancini recorded over 90 albums\, in styles ranging from big band to light classical to pop. Eight of these albums were certified gold by The Recording Industry Association of America. He had a 20-year contract with RCA Records\, resulting in 60 commercial record albums that made him a household name among artists of easy-listening music.  TINY BUBBLES "Tiny Bubbles" is a song written by Martin Denny and Leon Pober. It was released in 1966 by Don Ho.  It is widely considered to be Denny's most famous song.  MHO "Tiny Bubbles" is -\, with all due respect for Mr Denny\, a rather "simple" song but... hand the notes to a top arranger like Henry Mancini and .... what you get is a fabulous orchestral arrangement that\, in a way\, transforms the song into an easy floating ballad.  A particularly rich instrumentation with strings\, brass\, and all the other "standard" instruments of a large orchestra\, completed with the sound of the ukelele and harp\, so typical for the Hawaiian style music.  The Mancini chorus adds some warmth and "body" to the recording\, so\, in the end\, we get to hear a splendid version of this well known theme.   Have a great (musical) trip to "Aloha country" :) !  Enjoy. COL channel name VAL Socratess2007	0

The musical is the fifth adaptation of the play Parfumerie by Hungarian playwright Miklos Laszlo\, following the 1940 James Stewart-Margaret Sullavan film The Shop around the Corner and the 1949 Judy Garland-Van Johnson musical version In the Good Old Summertime.   The 1978 BBC version starring Robin Ellis and Gemma Craven is worth watching too.  It would surface yet again in 1998 as the Tom Hanks-Meg Ryan feature You've Got Mail. The plot revolves around Budapest shop employees Georg Nowack and Amalia Balash who\, despite being consistently at odds with each other at work\, are unaware that each is the other's secret pen pal met through lonely-hearts ads. The musical premiered on Broadway in 1963\, and subsequently had productions in the West End in 1964 and award-winning revivals on each side of the Atlantic in the 1990s\, as well as regional productions. *** COL channel name VAL 65Seasons	0

Upon its initial release by Fantasy Records in 1973\, the album was credited to "The Blue Ridge Rangers" with no mention of Fogerty on the cover. Fogerty chose to do this in order to distance himself from his Creedence legacy. The LP was later reissued and credited to John Fogerty with a different cover design. The CD reissue restores the original silhouette cover photo and credits the album to Fogerty. The album is made up entirely of traditional and country covers\, and features Fogerty playing all the instruments. The album peaked at #47 on the charts. Two singles from the album became hits: "Jambalaya" which peaked at #16\, and "Hearts of Stone" which peaked at #37. In 2009\, Fogerty released a sequel to this album\, entitled The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again.  Track listing Side one 1. "Blue Ridge Mountain Blues" (Traditional) -- 2:29 2.

'Tender Is the Night'  is a 1962 film directed by Henry King\, based on the novel of the same name by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The soundtrack featured a song\, also called "Tender Is the Night"\, by Sammy Fain (music) and Paul Francis Webster (lyrics)\, which was nominated for the 1962 Academy Award for Best Song.   Tender is the night So tender is the night There's no one in the world Except the two of us. Should tomorrow  Find us disenchanted We have shared a love That few have known. Summers by the sea A sailboat in Capri These memories shall be  These very own. Even though our dreams may vanish With the morning light We loved once in splendor How tender how tender is the night COL channel name VAL trooper7h	0

Heerink werd voornamelijk bekend als zanger van de Nederlandse hardrockband Vandenberg\, die ook internationaal succes had.Met Vandenberg had Heerink in de jaren 80 twee wereldhits: Burning Heart en Different Worlds. Nadat Vandenberg de samenwerking met Heerink beëindigde trad Bert toe tot de heavy metal band Picture en nam een aantal Nederlandstalige albums op. Bekend werd hij verder door in 1995 voor een aantal reclames voor Heineken Nederlandstalige teksten te zingen op melodieën van oude rocknummers. De nummers Zon in de Winter\, Doe wat je wil en Julie July werden hits. Voor het album Storm na de Stilte kreeg hij een gouden plaat.Bij de reünie van Kayak  in 2000 werd Heerink zanger van deze band en bleef dit tot 2006. In 2002 toert Bert met het orkest van de Koninklijke Luchtmacht door Nederland in de hoofdrol van "Tommy".Met Peter Groot Kormelink en Erik Mesie vormt Heerink het muzikale feestprogramma "De Heeren van Oranje" waarin alle grote hits van de 3 Heeren voorbij komen.Bert neemt in 2005/2006 ook vocalen voor zijn rekening tijdens de succesvolle tour van het orkest van Koninklijke Luchtmacht door de Nederlandse theaters: Queen in concert\, waarbij diverse Queen klassiekers worden vertolkt. Sommige nummers worden ook in een nieuw jasje gestoken\, zoals 'Crazy little thing called love'\, welke een big band sausje krijgt.In 2006 heeft Bert Heerink samen met zijn zus Saskia onder de naam Heerink een album uitgebracht met de naam Purify. Het album wordt gekenmerkt door een persoonlijke inslag.In 2007 en ook in 2008 maakte Heerink met het Noord Nederlands Orkest (NNO) onder leiding van de Belgische dirigent Dirk Brossé met het cross-overprogramma Symphonic echoes of Pink Floyd een tournee\, waarin de grote hits van de Engelse rockformatie centraal staan. Naast Heerink nemen Antonie Kamerling en Erik Mesie de zangpartijen voor hun rekening\, bijgestaan door onder meer gitarist Joost Vergoossen.Het wordt het tot dan toe best bezochte concertjaar met ruim 98.000 bezoekers. In 2008 vervangt Chris Zeegers Antonie Kamerling bij deze productie.Tegenwoordig (2006) woont Heerink in Hoogeveen. Recentelijk bracht Heerink de single "When I close my eyes"\, uit. De single is uitsluitend via de website www.bertheerink.nl te downloaden en de opbrengst gaat naar de stichting KidsRights die zich wereldwijd inzet voor de rechten van kinderen. Op 6 december 2008 ontving Bert Heerink het Lidmaatschap in de Orde van Oranje Nassau als waardering voor zijn inzet en prestaties in de popmuziek en zijn inzet voor de kinderrechtenorganisatie KidsRights. Eerder ontving Bert Heerink in Hoogeveen om dezelfde reden een eigen ster in de "Walk of Veen".In april 2009 brengt Heerink samen met collega's Erik Mesie en Peter Groot Kormelink onder de naam "Heeren van Oranje" hun eerste eigen single uit; "Made in Holland" waarmee ze landelijk debuteerden op het Tros Muziekfeest in Middelburg. In samenwerking met OAR Heaven Records werkt Bert vanaf mei 2009 in Duitsland in de studio van Michael Voss aan een volledig eigen Engelstalig rockalbum. De uitnodiging een dergelijk album te maken kwam na het meewerken aan het tweede "Voices of Rock" album waar Bert met "Shame on you" op vertegenwoordigd is. Het album komt op 25 september wereldwijd uit en bevat nummers van grote songwriters als Jeff Silbard (Wind beneath my Wings) en Russ Ballard.In februari 2010 komt de eerste single van dit album "Panic Attack" binnen in de single top 100 waarna deze doorstijgt en hoog in de charts komt. Een tweede stuk "All fired Up" wordt tegelijkertijd door het TT Circuit Assen gekozen tot de seizoenstune. Op 3 april trad Heerink tijdens de 5e uitreiking van de Eddie Christiani Award\, die hijzelf opnieuw presenteerde\,op met Steve Lukather\, (gitarist/zanger van Toto) de winnaar van deze editie.

COL title VAL Baby You're a Rich Man COL performer VAL Brian Sands	COL video title VAL You're Just In Love - Perry Como COL description VAL "You're Just in Love" is a popular song by Irving Berlin. It was published in 1950 and was first performed by Ethel Merman and Russell Nype in Call Me Madam\, a musical comedy that debuted at the Imperial Theatre in New York City on October 12 that year. The show ran for 644 performances. Ethel Merman also later starred in the 1953 film version. Theatre lore has it that Berlin wrote the song one night after Call Me Madam was not doing well in tryouts. The second act of the show was lacking. "What I'd like to do is a song with the kid (Russell Nype)\," Merman said. So\, Berlin went to his room and later produced the counterpoint song. When Berlin played the song for Merman\, she said "We'll never get off the stage." According to Berlin's biographer though\, Berlin played the song for Russell Nype first\, but admonished him not to admit he did so because it would infuriate Merman.  Several recorded versions made the charts in 1950-51: by Perry Como and The Fontane Sisters\, by Rosemary Clooney and Guy Mitchell\, and by Ethel Merman and Dick Haymes.  The Perry Como/Fontane Sisters version was recorded on September 26\, 1950 and released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number 20-3945. The record first reached the Billboard magazine charts on December 22\, 1950 and lasted 17 weeks on the chart\, peaking at #5.  The Rosemary Clooney/Guy Mitchell version was recorded on October 21\, 1950 and released by Columbia Records as catalog number 39052. The record first reached the Billboard magazine charts on February 23\, 1951 and lasted 2 weeks on the chart\, peaking at #29.  The Ethel Merman/Dick Haymes version was recorded on October 17\, 1950 and released by Decca Records as catalog number 27317. The record first reached the Billboard magazine charts on March 30\, 1951 and lasted 1 week on the chart\, at #30. Although the lowest charting of the three\, it got a considerable amount of airplay in subsequent years.  Musically\, the song is one of Irving Berlin's three well-known songs that use true counterpoint—a main melody with a secondary melody running at the same time\, both with independent lyrics - his two other best-known counterpoint songs are Play a Simple Melody and "An Old-Fashioned Wedding" (see the 1966 revival of "Annie Get Your Gun").

But I`d forget it\, I never said it. I`d pass the flower shop. Lord knows I meant to stop. But I`d say tomorrow\, perhaps tomorrow.   Tomorrow there`d be time. There`d always be another spring. Time to make her laughter ring. Time to give her everything.   For my Angelica\, my Angelica. There`s so much you never knew. So much I always meant to say\, and do\, for you\, for you. Angelica-a-a...   And then the cold winds came. And when I spoke her name. And held her near me. She couldn`t hear me...   The shadow had been cast. Too many springs had passed. For Angelica\, sweet Angelica. Now in my silent room\, I tend the flowers that I`d buy. As they slowly fade and die. Watered by the tears I cry.   For my Angelica\, my Angelica. There`s so much you never knew. So much I always meant\, to say and do for you\, for you. Angelica..... Angelica..... Angelica... COL channel name VAL Brent441	0

COL title VAL Chrome Optimism - Oxygen Part 4 Dub COL performer VAL Dubblestandart feat. David Lynch	COL video title VAL Johnny Mathis ~ Southern Nights COL description VAL This upload is in honor of Johnny's recent Grammy nomination for his latest CD: "Let It Be Me: Mathis in Nashville". I love many songs on this CD - this is one of my favorites. Love Johnny's wonderful\, contagious energy  (catch that sweet 'yeehaw' moment - s'cuze me - that's what comes when I hear it! -  at about 2:35 - and that's him in those cool\, cute sneaks movin' in Cohasset this summer)\,  and the beautiful symphonic blend of his interpretation with the incredible musicians accompanying him. In researching the song I watched several videos of Jerry Douglas (Dobro)\, Bryan Sutton (Acoustic Guitar\, Banjo\, Mandolin)\, Stuart Duncan (Fiddle\, Mandolin) and others\, all like Johnny\, gifted\, and according to executive producer Jay Lander's liner notes\,  'handpicked group of Nashville's finest" by producer Fred Molin.  If you don't own it- well worth it- and the notes\, so descriptive of each song's history. And one can't improve on Lander's further notes: "Johnny Mathis draws the listener into his world like a master storyteller.....the emotions\, in Johnny's hands\, nothing less than profound." You are not listening to a set of songs put to voice and music here. If you do what country music\, I believe 'invites' you to do\,  slow down\, listen\, take in the sounds\, the meaning\, the simplicity\, the emotions and joy\, you'll hear these stories with every nuance available. Enjoy!  And I defy your feet or body to stay still listening to this rich number! And here's to Johnny\, once again\, the consummate re-inventor of his own style\,and yet always just a step away from the 'magic' core we all love.   The song\, composed by Allen Toussaint\, was released in 1977 by Glenn Campbell and hit #1 as a 'cross over' number that year in Country\, Pop and Adult Contemporary.

He began writing the lyrics at home\, but never quite finished them\, because he had to fly to Nashville\, Tennessee for a recording session with veteran Columbia producer\, Don Law. Jimmy simply brought along the unfinished song. By the time he got off the plane\, he was virtually jumping with excitement. The song was completed and Don Law liked it so much\, that Big Bad John was recorded immediately" - (Side note: There's a little touch of "Sixteen Tons" by Tennessee Ernie Ford here as well) -  Note: What many today call\, "rapping" was originally\, in a cleaner form\, referred to as\,  "calling". Talking in rhyming sentences or speaking the lyrics instead of singing them\, which was very common in Country & Western music. It began with the square dance "caller" who gave direction to the dancers\, through rhyming sentences set to the cadence or beat of the music being played by a live band. He never sang\, he just spoke the words in rhyme. Much the same as a auction house auctioneer\, who speaks the bids in a fast rhythm\, choosing words which often rhyme.  The "caller" and the dance can be:  "traced back through England  to the old French cotillions" (17th century) (per Lloyd Shaw-1939). Also\, a form of "calling" or "auction house crying" can be found in the 1947 recording of\, "Smoke\, Smoke\, Smoke (That Cigarette) (Tex Williams & Phil Harris) or "The Darktown Poker Club" (1946) (Phil Harris) for example\, and many other older recordings. Therefore\, "rap" isn't new\, it's just a continuation of something which started many years earlier. (* No one has ever said this\,  but I believe\, "Cajun Doll"\, by Lattie Moore\,  may have inspired the writing of both "Big Bad John" and "The Cajun Queen". ) COL channel name VAL MrRJDB1969	0

COL title VAL Ich weiß\, es wird einmal ein Wunder geschehen COL performer VAL Elly Lapp	COL video title VAL Eugene Maslov-Chan's Song(Never Said)-2000 COL description VAL A pretty quick follow-up to his first CD When I Need to Smile\, Face of Love finds Maslov incorporating guests Toots Thielemans on harmonica and Shirley Horn on vocals\, and interpreting jazz and pop music from '60s icons\, adding an occasional innocuous synth wash here and there. Eddie Gomez is back on bass for eight cuts\, and Willie Jones\, George Schuller\, and Steve Williams split up drum chores. Asserting himself as a pyrotechnist\, Maslov's fine original playing comes to the forefront; he injects hard chords and neat ideas into the up samba of Herbie Hancock and Stevie Wonder's "Chan's Song." The Miles Davis-Victor Feldman evergreen "Seven Steps to Heaven" is wittily arranged\, shifting back and forth from upbeat waltz to regular 4/4 pace. A most interesting version of the Jimmy Rowles number "The Peacocks" sports heavy\, dense textures from Gomez with Maslov's left piano hand and synth\, and slight funk by Jones. The trio dives head first with no intro into "Them There Eyes\," jump starts "The Groove Merchant" including a solo piano break\, and adopts a more contemporary samba mode for Maslov's "Through Russian Eyes." Horn sings two ballads written by Mack Street honcho Gretchen Carhartt\, the tick-tock rhythm on the unrequited love torch song of a title track\, and the regret-filled "Come Back to Me Love." Thielemans' features are the "Days of Wine & Roses"-flavored ballad "More Love" and the classic\, tender waltz "Bluesette." This CD is an improvement and a continuation along the lines of the previous recording. ~ Michael G. Nastos jazz pianist's 2nd release on Mack Avenue offers a superb selection of songs ranging from Herbie Hancock's "Never Said" to Miles Davis/Victor Feldman's "Seven Steps To Heaven\," as well as originals; inc. vocals by Grammy winner Shirley Horn\, feat. specia Recorded at Clinton Studios\, New York\, New York in May & June 1999. Includes liner notes by Gretchen Carhartt. Personnel: Eugene Maslov (piano\, synthesizer); Shirley Horn (vocals); Willie Jones III (drums\, snare drum); Terrence "Bearwolf" Williams\, George Schuller (snare drum). Liner Note Author: Stix Hooper. Recording information: Clinton Recording Studios\, New York\, NY (05/1999-06/1999). Photographer: Chris Coxwell.

COL title VAL Out of My Dreams COL performer VAL Shirley Jones with Girls' Chorus	COL video title VAL "Warren Smith ~ Rock 'n' Roll Ruby" - Sun 239 1956 COL description VAL Warren Smith - Rock n Roll Ruby on Sun 239. Hope You ENJOY!!! Warren Smith (February 7\, 1932 -- January 30\, 1980) was an American rockabilly and country music singer and guitarist. Smith was born in Humphreys County\, Mississippi to Iola and Willie Warren Smith\, who divorced when he was young. He was raised by his maternal grandparents in Louise\, Mississippi where they had a small farm and dry goods store. Smith took up the guitar to while away his evenings while in the United States Air Force stationed in San Antonio\, Texas. By the time of his discharge from the service\, he had decided to make a career of music. He moved to West Memphis\, Arkansas and auditioned\, successfully\, to play the Cotton Club\, a local hot spot. Steel guitarist Stan Kessler\, who was playing at that nightclub with the Snearly Ranch Boys\, immediately spotted Smith's potential and took him to Sun Records to audition for Sam Phillips\, with the Snearly Ranch Boys providing backup. Phillips liked what he heard\, and decided that "Rock & Roll Ruby"\, a song credited to Johnny Cash\, would be Smith's first record. (Smith later claimed that "Rock & Roll Ruby" was actually written by George Jones and sold to Cash for $40.) Smith recorded it on February 5\, 1956. Phillips\, who was hedging his bets over whether rock and roll would maintain its popularity\, released that record with a country crooner\, aptly named "I'd Rather Be Safe Than Sorry"\, on the flip side. By May 26\, "Rock & Roll Ruby" had hit No. 1 on the local pop charts. Smith's first record for Sun went on to outsell the first Sun releases by Elvis Presley\, Johnny Cash and Carl Perkins. In August 1956\, Smith went back to the Sun Records studio to record his second release\, "Ubangi Stomp". This infectious rocker had an incorrect lyric including an African chief with the syntax of a movie Indian. For the B side\, Smith recorded the classic ballad "Black Jack David". This song\, which originated in early 18th-century Britain and survived in various forms in the mountains of the American south\, may be the oldest song ever recorded by a rock and roll performer. Although a resounding artistic success\, it did not sell as well as Smith's debut. In 1957\, Smith recorded "So Long\, I'm Gone"\, a song written by Roy Orbison\, and it did become Smith's biggest hit at Sun\, peaking at No. 74 nationally (Billboard). But Sun had no cash to promote it at the same time as Sam Phillips put every dollar Sun had behind Jerry Lee Lewis' "Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin On". Although Smith continued to make rockabilly records for Sun\, including a cover version of Slim Harpo's "Got Love If Your Want It" (recorded in October 1957)\, these records did not do well commercially. Toward the end of 1958\, Smith\, seeing his future in country music\, cut a final record for Sun\, a cover version of Don Gibson's "Sweet Sweet Girl". In spite of a review in Billboard calling it "ultra commercial"\, this record also failed to sell. Like other artists such as Sonny Burgess\, Hayden Thompson\, Billy Lee Riley and Ray Harris\, chart success largely eluded him. Smith then decided to leave Sun Records.

Today the mysterious Taggy Matcher and Stix Records are proud to present his first album. After a first single covering two tracks of The Black Keys (2013)\, Taggy recently presented the song “My Man”\, alongside the young talented LMK. On this track\, he digs more into the Digital sound from the early 80s\, showing another side of his production scale.   Coming out late November\, this album called "Singasong" definitely explores even more into the various styles of Jamaican music.  http://www.favoriterec.com/2014/10/taggy-matcher-singasong-lp COL channel name VAL Favorite Recordings	0

COL title VAL Here Comes Summer COL performer VAL Bruce & Terry	COL video title VAL Cornelis Vreeswijk - Epistel 81 COL description VAL Cornelis Vreeswijk - Epistel 81  Mijn favoriete troubadour uit de 70-er jaren: Cornelis Vreeswijk werd in 1937 in IJmuiden geboren als oudste van vier kinderen. In 1948\, Cornelis was toen elf jaar oud\, verhuisde het gezin naar Stockholm in Zweden waar zijn vader\, Jacob Cornelis Vreeswijk\, nadat hij in Nederland een taxi- en garagebedrijf had gehad\, ging werken als automonteur. Het gezin remigreerde in 1961 naar Nederland\, maar Cornelis en zijn zuster Ida bleven in Zweden wonen.  Vreeswijk debuteerde in 1964 met Ballader och oförskämdheter (Ballades en onbeschaamdheden). Zijn grote doorbraak kwam in 1968 met Tio vackra visor och personliga Person (Tien mooie liederen en 'persoonlijke Person'\, een woordspeling op een Zweedse achternaam). Hij nam ook liederen op van Carl Michael Bellman (1740-1795\, een Zweeds dichter) en Evert Taube (1890 - 1976)\, zijn directe voorganger als belangrijkste Zweedse troubadour.  Ook na zijn dood bleef Vreeswijks oeuvre in Zweden ongekend populair\, getuige ook de nationale Cornelis Vreeswijkdag aldaar.  Vreeswijk werd in 1966 door de VARA uitgenodigd naar Nederland te komen. Een single van De nozem en de non flopte. Zes jaar later verscheen zijn elpee Cornelis Vreeswijk (1972) die bekroond werd met platina; er werden honderdduizend exemplaren van verkocht. Zijn volgende Nederlandstalige platen hadden echter maar weinig succes.  In 1973 verscheen zijn LP I stället för vykort (In plaats van ansichtkaarten)\, waarop hij stelling nam tegen de oorlog in Vietnam. Teksten van Victor Jara werden door hem in 1978 op de plaat gezet.  In 1974 reikte Prins Adrianus I van carnavalsvereniging de Pintenwippers uit IJmuiden aan Vreeswijk het grootkruis der Pintenwippers uit.  In 1985 werd bij Vreeswijk leverkanker geconstateerd. Hij stierf twee jaar later op 50-jarige leeftijd COL channel name VAL Tjerk T.	0

Mulligan's pianoless quartet of the early 1950s with trumpeter Chet Baker is still regarded as one of the more important cool jazz groups. Mulligan was also a skilled pianist and played several other reed instruments. "There are some words that have been kind of lost from modern usage that I would like to bring to my music and have striven all my life to do\, BEAUTY\, GRACE\, NOBILITY\, these are the things that music can bring to us\, as human beings. I think it is well that we who make music keep that in our consciousness." -GERRY MULLIGAN COL channel name VAL Music Legends Book	0

The original line-up consisted of Brian le Gassick – lead vocals\, guitar\, John Leach – lead guitar\, Willie van der Walt – bass and Ian Miller – drums. In 1962 Leach and van der Walt were replaced by Richard Crouse – guitar\, Jimmy Routledge – bass and Billy Andrews – vocals\, harmonica (Billy later became one half of the duo the “Dream Merchants” with Billy Forrest). In 1964 the Staccatos won the Transvaal Merseyside Contest\, which included a recording contract with EMI. They supported Peter and Gordon on their tour of South Africa in 1965.  In 1966 Steve Lonsdale took over the lead vocals\, and Richard Crouse married Wanda Arletti who joined the group for a tour of Zambia. In 1967 Eddie Boyle – bass\, and Ronnie Cline – organ\, joined the group. In 1968 Billy Forrest approached the group to record “Cry to me” for the film “Katrina”. This song became their biggest hit\, reaching number 1 on the South African Top 20 in 1969 and charting for a massive 38 weeks\, earning them a double gold disc.  In 1969 John Elliot – sax\, joined the group and in 1970 Ivor Black – drums and Peter Vee – lead vocals (Steve Lonsdale left for America).

Jack Henderson Clement (April 5\, 1931 – August 8\, 2013) was an American singer\, songwriter\, and a record and film producer.

But I`d forget it\, I never said it. I`d pass the flower shop. Lord knows I meant to stop. But I`d say tomorrow\, perhaps tomorrow.   Tomorrow there`d be time. There`d always be another spring. Time to make her laughter ring. Time to give her everything.   For my Angelica\, my Angelica. There`s so much you never knew. So much I always meant to say\, and do\, for you\, for you. Angelica-a-a...   And then the cold winds came. And when I spoke her name. And held her near me. She couldn`t hear me...   The shadow had been cast. Too many springs had passed. For Angelica\, sweet Angelica. Now in my silent room\, I tend the flowers that I`d buy. As they slowly fade and die. Watered by the tears I cry.   For my Angelica\, my Angelica. There`s so much you never knew. So much I always meant\, to say and do for you\, for you. Angelica..... Angelica..... Angelica... COL channel name VAL Brent441	0

COL title VAL I Take What I Want COL performer VAL La De Da's	COL video title VAL A Love Supreme\, Part 1: Acknowledgement - John Coltrane (1965) COL description VAL "Part 1: Acknowledgement" was the first track on "A Love Supreme"\, a jazz studio album recorded by John Coltrane's classic quartet in December 1964 and released by Impulse! Records in February 1965.  It is generally considered to be among Coltrane's greatest works\, as it melded the hard bop sensibilities of his early career with the free jazz style he adopted later.  The quartet recorded the album in one session on December 9\, 1964\, at the Van Gelder Studio in Englewood Cliffs\, New Jersey.  The album is a four-part suite\, broken up into tracks: "Acknowledgement" (which contains the mantra that gave the suite its name)\, "Resolution"\, "Pursuance"\, and "Psalm".  It is intended to be a spiritual album\, broadly representative of a personal struggle for purity\, and expresses Coltrane's deep gratitude as he admits to his talent and instrument as being owned not by him but by a spiritual higher power.  The track begins the album with the bang of a gong\, or tam-tam\, followed by cymbal washes.  Jimmy Garrison follows on bass with the four-note motif which structures the entire movement\, after which Coltrane's solo follows.  Besides soloing upon variations of the motif\, at one point Coltrane repeats the four notes over and over in different modulations.  After many repetitions\, the motif becomes the vocal chant "A Love Supreme"\, sung by Coltrane\, accompanying himself via overdubs.  "A Love Supreme" is often listed amongst the greatest jazz albums of all time.  It was also quite popular for a jazz album\, selling about 500\,000 copies by 1970\, a number far exceeding Coltrane's typical Impulse! sales of around 30\,000.  As further testimony to the recording's historic significance\, the manuscript for the album is one of the National Museum of American History's 'Treasures of American History'\, part of the collection of the Smithsonian Institution.  The Penguin Guide to Jazz selected this album as part of its suggested 'Core Collection'\, stating "It is without precedent and parallel\, and though it must also be one of the best-loved jazz records of all time it somehow remains remote from critical pigeonholing" calling it "immensely concentrated and rich."  The album's influence has been extensive and diverse.  Musicians ranging from tenor Joshua Redman to the singer Bono of U2 have singled out the influence of the album on their own work.  Guitarists John McLaughlin and Carlos Santana have each credited the album as one of their greatest early influences.  John William Coltrane\, sometimes abbreviated 'Trane' (September 23\, 1926 -- July 17\, 1967)\, was an American jazz saxophonist and composer. He was beatified by the African Orthodox Church as Saint John William Coltrane.  Working in the bebop and hard bop idioms early in his career\, Coltrane helped pioneer the use of modes in jazz and later was at the forefront of free jazz.  He was prolific\, organizing at least fifty recording sessions as a leader during his recording career\, and appeared as a sideman on many other albums\, notably with trumpeter Miles Davis and pianist Thelonious Monk.  As his career progressed\, his music took on an increasingly spiritual dimension.  He influenced innumerable musicians\, and remains one of the most significant tenor saxophonists in jazz history.  Coltrane died from liver cancer at Huntington Hospital on Long Island on July 17\, 1967\, at the age of 40.  This channel is dedicated to the classic jazz music you've loved for years.

COL video title VAL Sue Keller plays Wild Women Don't Have The Blues by Ida Cox COL description VAL Sunday\, March 16\, 2008 at the Scott Joplin House in St. Louis\, Missouri. This was recorded as part of the Sue Keller seminar presentation on "Women and the Blues".  The piece is a composition by Ida Cox from the early 20's titled\, "Wild Women Don't Have The Blues".  The presentation covered the following early blues women: Mamie Smith\, Bessie Smith\, Ma Rainey\, Lucille Hegamin\, Ida Cox\, Alberta Hunter and their influences on Ella May Morse\, Billie Holiday\, Etta James\, Patsy Cline\, Marcia Ball\, and Aretha Franklin.  The reference at the end is to how Sue used to play this as a rock tune with the Jeanne French Band in Boston back in the 70's... Jeanne's in Singapore now but her version is track #4 on her Mean Man Blues album available on buy.com.  Lyle Lovett also does a very nice version\, but uses lyrics modified by Francine Reed. The piano is a 7-foot Boston Grand model 218. COL channel name VAL hv60604	0

COL title VAL Who Is He And What Is He to You COL performer VAL Me'Shell Ndegéocello	COL video title VAL Bill Withers - Who Is He (And What Is He to You) COL description VAL Bill Withers - Who Is He (And What Is He to You)  William Harrison "Bill" Withers\, Jr. (born July 4\, 1938) is an American singer-songwriter and musician who performed and recorded from 1970 until 1985. Some of his best-known songs are "Lean on Me"\, "Ain't No Sunshine"\, "Use Me"\, "Just the Two of Us"\, "Lovely Day"\, and "Grandma's Hands". His life was recently the subject of the documentary film Still Bill. Withers was born the youngest of thirteen children in the small coal-mining town of Slab Fork\, West Virginia. Raised in nearby Beckley\, West Virginia\, Withers was thirteen years old when his father died. He enlisted with the United States Navy at age eighteen and served for nine years\, during which time he became interested in singing and writing songs. Soon after his discharge from the Navy in 1970\, he relocated to Los Angeles for a musical career. Withers worked as an assembler for several different companies\, including Douglas Aircraft Corporation\, while recording demo tapes with his own money\, shopping them around and performing in clubs at night. When he debuted with the song "Ain't No Sunshine" he refused to resign his job because of his belief that the music business was a fickle industry and that he was still a novice compared to other acts.  Lyrics  A man we passed just tried to stare me down  And when I looked at you\, you looked at the ground  I don't know who he is but I think that you do   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   I have something in my heart and in your eyes  Tell me he's not someone just passin' by  And when you cleared your throat was that your cue   Dag gummit dag  Who is he and what is he to you   Now when I add the sum of you and me  I get confused and I keep coming up with three  You're too much for one man but not enough for two   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Hey you tell me man don't have not much for intuition  That what you really think or are you wishin'  Before you wreck your old home be certain of the new   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you COL channel name VAL Alf	1

Auf Druck der amerikanischen Band gleichen Namens benannten sie sich 1959 in The Shadows um. Den Vorschlag hierzu machte Jet Harris bei einer Runde „Ale and Lime" in der „2i's Coffee Bar"\, nachdem die vier Musiker stets im „Schatten" von Cliff Richard gestanden hatten[1].       Erinnerungsplakette an die 2i's Coffee Bar in London\, 59 Old Compton Street\, Soho  Bandmitglieder sind Hank B. Marvin (Gitarre)\, Bruce Welch (Gitarre)\, Jet Harris (Bass) und Tony Meehan (Schlagzeug). Anfang der 1960er machten Harris und Meehan (erfolgreiche Titel: „Diamonds" und „Scarlett O'Hara") als Duo weiter. Brian Bennett übernahm bei den Shadows das Schlagzeug\, und am Bass spielten nacheinander Brian „Liquorice" Locking und John Rostill.   In den 1960ern spielten sie sowohl mit Cliff Richard als auch solo. 1960 hatten sie mit Apache einen großen Erfolg\, dem vier weitere Nummer-1-Hits folgten.

Although the musicians cannot be identified with 100% certainty\, I believe them to be Jimmy Dorsey\, alto sax; Benny Goodman\, clarinet; Joe Venuti\, violin; Eddie Lang\,Guitar; Phil Napolean\, trumpet; Jack Teagarden\, trombone; and Rube Bloom\, piano. Annette sang this song in her only film appearance-a short 1.41 clip from a Captain Henry's Showboat 1933 program.  It became her trademark song.

COL title VAL Step Inside Love COL performer VAL Elvis Costello & The Attractions	COL video title VAL Joanie Sommers – “Step Inside Love” (Happy Tiger) 1968 COL description VAL Written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Arranged by  Capps and produced by Joseph Porter.  Joanie\, who scored a #7 US hit with “Johnny Get Angry” in the summer of 1962\, didn’t return to Hot-100 after “When The Boys Get Together” charted in October of the same year.  Some great records followed on Warners\, however\, including the northern soul favorite\, “Don’t Pity Me” in 1965. By 1967\, Joanie was with Columbia and following year with Capitol but still the hits continued to elude her – notwithstanding the quality of her recordings.  “Step Inside Love” had been a #8 UK hit for Cilla Black during Cilla’s ten year chart run from the early 60s.  The Happy Tiger label was owned by the Flying Tiger Line\, an air freight company. The label ran from 1968-71 and was home to artists such as Donnie Brooks\, Priscilla Paris and Them.

COL title VAL Chitlins Con Carne COL performer VAL Melvin Taylor	COL video title VAL Ronnie Aldrich and His Orchestra - What is life COL description VAL Ronnie Aldrich and His Orchestra (in this case\, the "London Festival Orchestra") bring you this fantastic arrangement of George Harrison's second successful single "What is life ?"  Harrison wrote the song in 1969 for Billy Preston\, but decided to include the composition in his own solo album "All things must pass".  The track became a Top 10 hit in many European countries\, and even in the US.  Ronnie Aldrich (who started playing the piano at age 3 ! ) started his musical career in the 1940's when he formed the band "Ronnie Aldrich and the Squadronaires" (with the word "squadron" appearing in the band's name looks like WWII played an important part here...).  The Squadronaires kept performing until 1964 and then Aldrich signed a contract with Decca. Here he issued more than 30 albums during the late 1960's (and up to his death in 1977) as "Ronnie Aldrich and the two pianos".  These two pianos (alternately to be heard on the left and right channel) conquered a large part of the easy listening audience and hence Aldrich became increasingly popular.  Being a talented composer\, arranger\, conductor and pianist\,  he also often appeared on BBC Radio.  Later\, he became musical director of Thames Television (and was appointed music supervisor for the famous "Benny Hill Show"). From the 1971 album "Love story" here is Ronnie Aldrich with a fabulously arranged version of George Harrison's "What is life".  Enjoy ! COL channel name VAL Socratess2007	0

This song was released earlier on the Junior label\, same version & same flip-side. Before the group became The Silhouettes they were known as The Gospel Tornadoes when they sang in churches on Sundays. When they sang in nightclubs during the rest of the week they were known as The Thunderbirds.  Kae Williams a local disc jockey (WDAS) and the owner of Junior records named the group after The Rays 1957 hit single on Cameo 117 "Silhouettes".

COL title VAL My Window Faces the South COL performer VAL Sammi Smith	COL video title VAL Jerry Lee Lewis - Let's Talk About Us COL description VAL Jerry Lee Lewis (born September 29\, 1935) is an American singer-songwriter\, musician\, and pianist\, who is often known by his nickname of The Killer and is often viewed as "rock & roll's first great wild man." As an early pioneer of rock and roll music\, in 1956 Lewis made his first recordings at Sun Records in Memphis. "Crazy Arms" sold 300\,000 copies in the South\, but it was his 1957 hit "Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On" that shot Lewis to fame worldwide. Lewis followed this when he recorded songs such as "Great Balls of Fire"\, "Breathless" and "High School Confidential". However\, Lewis's rock and roll career faltered in the wake of his marriage to his 13-year-old cousin when he was 22. He had little success in the charts following the scandal and his popularity quickly faded. His live performance fees plummeted from $10\,000 per night to $250. In the meantime he was determined to gain back some of his popularity. During the early 1960s he didn't have much chart success with few exceptions such as "What'd I Say". His live performances at this time were increasingly wild and energetic. His album Live at the Star Club\, Hamburg from 1964 is often regarded by many music journalists and fans as one of the wildest and greatest rock and roll concert albums ever. After recording songs such as "I'm on Fire" for several years with little success\, in 1968 Lewis made a transition into country music and had hits with songs such as "Another Place\, Another Time". This reignited his career and throughout the late 1960s and 1970s he regularly topped the country-western charts. His No. 1 country hits included "To Make Love Sweeter For You"\, "There Must Be More to Love Than This"\, "Would You Take Another Chance on Me" and "Me and Bobby McGee" COL channel name VAL Music Legends Book	0

He was born in West Point\, Mississippi in an area now known as White Station. With a booming voice and looming physical presence\, Burnett is commonly ranked among the leading performers in electric blues; musician and critic Cub Koda declared\, "no one could match Howlin' Wolf for the singular ability to rock the house down to the foundation while simultaneously scaring its patrons out of its wits." A number of songs written or popularized by Burnett—such as "Smokestack Lightnin'"\, "Back Door Man"\, "Killing Floor" and "Spoonful"—have become blues and blues rock standards.

COL title VAL He Taught Me to Yodel COL performer VAL Kitten and The Country Gentlemen	COL video title VAL 'With my eyes wide open I'm dreaming'--Patti Page 'Quartet' (1949) COL description VAL Recorded in November 1949\, this is a classic example of 'multiple' recording\, as opposed to multitrack recording.  At the time this record was made there were no multitrack tape recorders.  In fact\, the studio this was recorded at (most likely Reeves in New York City) had yet to acquire tape equipment; hence\, this recording was made by first recording part of the music on one lacquer disc\, then playing this disc back through a mixer while another part was played or sung live along with the playback\, the mix of these parts being then recorded onto a second lacquer disc.  This was done four times (original recording plus three overdubs) to produce the four vocal parts heard on this record.   Les Paul was the first to produce successful 'multiples' (as he called them)\, both technically and artistically\, and what his label Capitol nicknamed 'The New Sound' spawned a brief fad where other performers tried to mimic his recording technique on their records\, with varying degrees of success.  This record was one of the better ones\, and Patti Page had several hits with this type of sound. COL channel name VAL PerisphereRec	0

COL title VAL Question COL performer VAL Fish	COL video title VAL Walker Brothers :::: Pretty Girls Everywhere. COL description VAL The Walker Brothers were an American pop group of the 1960s and 1970s\, comprising Scott Engel (eventually known professionally as Scott Walker)\, John Walker (born John Maus\, but using the name Walker since his teens)\, and Gary Leeds (eventually known as Gary Walker). After moving to Britain in 1965\, they had a number of top ten albums and singles there\, including the No. 1 chart hits "Make It Easy on Yourself" and "The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine (Anymore)\," both of which also made the US top 20.  Formed in 1964\, they adopted the 'Walker Brothers' name even though the members are all unrelated as a show business touch—"simply because we liked it." They provided a unique counterpoint to the British Invasion in that they were a group from the United States that achieved much more success in the United Kingdom than in their home country\, during the period when the popularity of British bands such as The Beatles dominated the US.

Song extracted from Guilty Pleasures. The original version of this song is performed by Nick Lowe.

The idea to record an album of covers appeared when someone remarked that Lazlo Bane sounded a bit like the 70's band\, Steeler's Wheel. The next day\, the band were asked to record a 70's driving song for a scene in a movie. Lazlo Bane chose "Stuck in the Middle with You" and it became the very first song for the new album.  The titles of several songs were changed. The first song\, listed as "Get Right Back"\, is actually titled "Right Back Where We Started From". The fifth song\, listed as "Lime in the Coconut"\, is actually titled "Coconut". The sixth song\, listed as "Alone Again"\, is actually titled "Alone Again (Naturally)".  TRACKLIST: 1. Get Right Back 2. Stuck in the Middle of You 3.Lonely Boy 4. I'm Not in Love 5. Lime in the Coconut 6. Alone Again 7. Baby Come Back 8. Take the Long Way Home 9. Nothing from Nothing 10.

It was also used as the B-side of their 1967 single "All You Need Is Love". New mixes of the song were made available on the compilation albums Magical Mystery Tour and Yellow Submarine Songtrack.  Composition  Two song fragments were combined to create "Baby\, You're a Rich Man". The verses from "One of the Beautiful People" by John Lennon were combined with Paul McCartney's previously unaccompanied "Baby\, you're a rich man ..." chorus. Two songs were combined in a similar fashion to make "A Day in the Life"\, and "I've Got a Feeling".  Recording  The song was recorded and mixed (in mono) on 11 May 1967 at Olympic Sound Studios. The music featured an unusual oboe-like sound which was created with a clavioline (an early forerunner of the synthesiser) and a spin-echo (feed back delay) effect which was used to fill from the end of one line of the verse to the start of the next.  Personnel  Per Lewisohn & MacDonald:  John Lennon -- double-tracked vocal\, clavioline\, piano Paul McCartney -- harmony vocal\, piano\, bass George Harrison -- harmony vocal\, guitar\, handclaps Ringo Starr -- drums\, tambourine\, maracas\, handclaps Brian Jones -- oboe Eddie Kramer -- vibraphone George Martin -- producer Keith Grant -- engineer  Mick Jagger was also present and his name appears on a session tape box\, possibly indicating that he provided backing vocals near the end of the song.

Now that you know who you are What do you want to be? And have you travelled very far? Far as the eye can see. How does it feel to be One of the beautiful people? How often have you been there? Often enough to know. What did you see\, when you were there? Nothing that doesn't show. Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man too. You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo. What a thing to do. Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man too. How does it feel to be One of the beautiful people? Tuned to a natural E Happy to be that way. Now that you've found another key What are you going to play? Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man too. You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo. What a thing to do. Baby you're a rich man...

Stan Kelly  Lyrics: Oh you are a mucky kid\, Dirty as a dustbin lid. When he hears the things you did\, You'll gerra belt from your Dad. Oh you have your father's nose\, So crimson in the dark it glows\, If you're not asleep when the boozers close\, You'll gerra belt from your Dad.   You look so scruffy lying dur Strawberry-jam tats in yer 'air\, Though in the world you haven't a care And I have got so many. It's quite a struggle every day Living on your father's pay\, The bugger drinks it all away And leaves me without any.   Although we have no silver spoon\, Better days are coming soon Now Nelly's working at the Lune And she gets paid on Friday. Perhaps one day we'll have a splash\, When Littlewoods provide the cash\, We'll get a house in Knotty Ash And buy your Dad a brewery.   Oh you are a mucky kid\, Dirty as a dustbin lid. When he hears the things you did You'll gerra belt from your Dad. Oh you have your father's face\, You're growing up a real hard case\, But there's no one can take your place\, .... Go fast asleep for yer Mammy. COL channel name VAL DecemberedCorpInc	1

I lay there in the sun And felt it caressing my face As I fell asleep And dreamed. I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie And that I was the star of the movie. This really blew my mind\, The fact that me\, An overfed\, long-haired\, leaping gnome\, Should be the star of a Hollywood movie. Hmm\, but there I was. I was taken to a place\, The hall of the mountain king. I stood high upon a mountain top\, Naked to the world\, In front of every kind of girl. There was long ones\, tall ones\, short ones\, brown ones\, Black ones\, round ones\, big ones\, crazy ones. Out of the middle Came a lady. She whispered in my ear Something crazy. She said\, Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl." I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back As she disappeared\, But soon she returned. In her hand was a bottle of wine\, In the other\, a glass. She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass And raised it to her lips And\, just before she drank it\, She said\, Take the wine\, take that girl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl. Spill the wine\, take that pearl." Take that pearl\, yeah. It's on girl\, all you gotta do is spill that wine\, spill that wine. Let me feel\, let me feel fine\, yeah\, yeah. Spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, spill the wine\, take that pearl.

COL title VAL Mother and Child Reunion COL performer VAL Johnny Rivers	COL video title VAL Randy California / Kapt. Kopter &  The (Fabulous) Twirly Birds - Mother And Child Reunion COL description VAL Randy California (наст. имя Randy Craig Wolfe; Лос-Анджелес\, 20 февраля 1951 - 2 января 1997) был гитарист\, вокалист и автор песен рок-группы Spirit\, созданной в 1967 году. Входит в список "100 лучших гитаристов мира" по версии журнала Classic Rock. Сценический псевдоним "Рэнди Калифорния" дал ему (в 15 лет) Джими Хендрикс\, чтобы можно было отличить от другого Рэнди в тогдашней группе Хендрикса Jimmy James and the Blue Flames (второго Рэнди Хендрикс называл "Рэнди Техас"). После ухода из группы Spirit (июль 1971) Рэнди начал сольную карьеру\, подписал контракт с Epic и выпустил осенью 1972 года альбом Kapt. Kopter and the (Fabulous) Twirly Birds. Музыка - Хендриксо-подобная\, с импровизациями\, кроме того здесь на некоторых треках играет басист Noel Redding (ex-Jimi Hendrix Experience). Следует отметить\, что на этой пластинке некоторые известные музыканты записаны под псевдонимами. С Эдом Кэссиди (своим отчимом) и басистом Ларри Найтом (Larry «Fuzzy» Knight) он провёл в Европе гастроли в поддержку своей пластинки. Но не совсем удачные\, так как Калифорния оказался неважным промоутером... Трио\, кроме того\, подготовило концептуальный альбом Potatoland\, но лейбл его отверг и Калифорния на некоторое время ушёл из музыкального бизнеса\, поселившись на Гавайях.

Link below COL description VAL https://youtu.be/gVrCs58PNUU This is a much better HD copy of the music\, plus Stay a Little Longer.  Westenr Swing music from the 1940s.  This has Noel Boggs on Steel\, which means after the war probably 1946. Alex Beshear on trumpet plays it without a mute.  That was quite unusual for him.  Also Tommy sings it.  When Bob made the Okey 78\, the vocalist was Danny Alguire\, who also played trumpet.  Tommy had joined the army when that session took play. So here we get to hear the way he would have done it.  Just wish the quality was better.  Notice the accordian?  Bob never used one in his recordings\, and I have to wonder where Noel plugged in his steel guitar.  Behind a tree?  Hot session\, though.

A real "Jazz Oddity" - Federica Zammarchi "Jazz Oddity"\, consists in eleven re-arrangements of songs of David Bowie. Its concept came up a few years ago\, when she needed to mix together her two main musical loves\, namely jazz and 70's rock\, both so important during her forming years. It was recorded with an Italian all- star band and it showcases a uniquely innovative sound\, slightly influenced by european bands like the Esbjörn Svensson Trio\, coining a new genre definition called "PowerJazz".

It is Holland (and not Kim Weston in 1965) who did the first recording of "Take me in Your Arms (Rock Me a Little While)" in 1964 but it was not released commercially until 2005\, even though Weston's cover was the first commercial release. Listen and compare how Weston's cover is almost similar to Holland's original version here.   http://fr.youtube.com/watch?v=h4SEm44Ee8A&feature=related  The better known version that people most remember is the Doobie Brothers' cover in 1975 which went up to number 11 on the Billboard Charts that year.

COL title VAL Bewildered COL performer VAL Ink Spots	COL video title VAL Staccatos - Police on my back COL description VAL The Staccatos are a South African band formed in November 1961 by Brian Le Gassick. The original line-up consisted of Brian le Gassick – lead vocals\, guitar\, John Leach – lead guitar\, Willie van der Walt – bass and Ian Miller – drums. In 1962 Leach and van der Walt were replaced by Richard Crouse – guitar\, Jimmy Routledge – bass and Billy Andrews – vocals\, harmonica (Billy later became one half of the duo the “Dream Merchants” with Billy Forrest). In 1964 the Staccatos won the Transvaal Merseyside Contest\, which included a recording contract with EMI. They supported Peter and Gordon on their tour of South Africa in 1965.  In 1966 Steve Lonsdale took over the lead vocals\, and Richard Crouse married Wanda Arletti who joined the group for a tour of Zambia. In 1967 Eddie Boyle – bass\, and Ronnie Cline – organ\, joined the group. In 1968 Billy Forrest approached the group to record “Cry to me” for the film “Katrina”. This song became their biggest hit\, reaching number 1 on the South African Top 20 in 1969 and charting for a massive 38 weeks\, earning them a double gold disc.  In 1969 John Elliot – sax\, joined the group and in 1970 Ivor Black – drums and Peter Vee – lead vocals (Steve Lonsdale left for America).  This song is off the album “He Was A Friend Of Mine” released in 1970. COL channel name VAL keurspel (Leon Rossouw)	0

COL title VAL Americano COL performer VAL The Brian Setzer Orchestra	COL video title VAL Johnnie Ray - When It's Springtime In The Rockies (Original Mono 45) COL description VAL Here's Johnnie Ray\, with a song that did nothing in the US or UK\, but was a big hit here in Australia....and\, it's a magnificent recording of a classic song.  It was released in Australia in late 1959\, and was actually the flipside of a Coronet 45\, KS-363. The A. side was "Wagon Wheels"\, which I've also uploaded to YouTube. Both tracks were lifted from Johnnie's country flavoured LP\, "On The Trail".  This flipside charted in Brisbane (# 5)\, Sydney (#13)\, Melbourne (# 3) and Adelaide (# 3).  It's interesting that the orchestra was conducted by Boudleaux Bryant\, who is better known for his stellar country & pop songwriting partnership with his wife\, Felice.  This upload is from the original Aussie mono 45.  *** If you like my channel\, why not SUBSCRIBE?

COL title VAL Seven Bridges Road COL performer VAL Eagles	COL video title VAL Swinging London: Jack Hylton - A Precious Little Thing Called Love\, 1929 COL description VAL Jack Hylton & His Orchestra with Vocal Refrain - A Precious Little Thing Called Love (Davis /Coots) Fox-trot from the film "The Shopworn Angel"\, HMV (UK)  NOTE: "The Shopworn angel" was in the US a Big Hey of the year 1928/29 - possibly\, because of featured fantastic duo: the most handsome actor of the world\, Gary Cooper (here\, even more handsome in his soldier's suit) and Nancy Carroll  - who was one of  the most charming "it" girls of the Roaring Twenties. This partially sound movie tells an interesting story of the young and naive soldier from Texas (Gary Cooper) who - before his shipping off  to Europe (World War 1) meets a sophisticated music hall star and convinces her to play the role of his girlfriend\, to impress his buddies. Alas\, the good hearted country bumpkin dies on the war and the girl\, who feels almost in love with him\, has to find her way back to the abandoned boyfriend of her (Paul Lukas). The film's leading tune: "A Precious Little Thing Called Love" has quickly became the world evergreens and one of the trade marks of the American Roaring Twenties. Among hundreds of renditions\, dear old Jackie Hylton from London has done an exceptionally good  job to make this song a real gem. COL channel name VAL 240252	0
COL title VAL Ragazzo di strada COL performer VAL Matia Bazar	COL video title VAL 'With my eyes wide open I'm dreaming'--Patti Page 'Quartet' (1949) COL description VAL Recorded in November 1949\, this is a classic example of 'multiple' recording\, as opposed to multitrack recording.  At the time this record was made there were no multitrack tape recorders.  In fact\, the studio this was recorded at (most likely Reeves in New York City) had yet to acquire tape equipment; hence\, this recording was made by first recording part of the music on one lacquer disc\, then playing this disc back through a mixer while another part was played or sung live along with the playback\, the mix of these parts being then recorded onto a second lacquer disc.  This was done four times (original recording plus three overdubs) to produce the four vocal parts heard on this record.   Les Paul was the first to produce successful 'multiples' (as he called them)\, both technically and artistically\, and what his label Capitol nicknamed 'The New Sound' spawned a brief fad where other performers tried to mimic his recording technique on their records\, with varying degrees of success.  This record was one of the better ones\, and Patti Page had several hits with this type of sound. COL channel name VAL PerisphereRec	0

Song extracted from Guilty Pleasures. The original version of this song is performed by Nick Lowe.  If you like this\, you can also listen to other tracks here  http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/lazlobane3  Guilty Pleasures is a 2007 album by the band Lazlo Bane\, consisting entirely of cover versions of various hits from the 1970s. The idea to record an album of covers appeared when someone remarked that Lazlo Bane sounded a bit like the 70's band\, Steeler's Wheel. The next day\, the band were asked to record a 70's driving song for a scene in a movie. Lazlo Bane chose "Stuck in the Middle with You" and it became the very first song for the new album.  The titles of several songs were changed. The first song\, listed as "Get Right Back"\, is actually titled "Right Back Where We Started From". The fifth song\, listed as "Lime in the Coconut"\, is actually titled "Coconut". The sixth song\, listed as "Alone Again"\, is actually titled "Alone Again (Naturally)".  TRACKLIST: 1. Get Right Back 2. Stuck in the Middle of You 3.Lonely Boy 4. I'm Not in Love 5. Lime in the Coconut 6. Alone Again 7. Baby Come Back 8. Take the Long Way Home 9. Nothing from Nothing 10.

They are well known for collaborating with former Men at Work member Colin Hay\, and providing the song "Superman" as the theme for the television show Scrubs. "Superman" also appeared on the soundtrack for the movie The Tao of Steve in 2000.  Lazlo Bane are: Chad Fischer\, Tim Bright\, Chris Link and Chicken COL channel name VAL redefine4	0

COL title VAL Who Is She (And What Is She to You) COL performer VAL The Three Degrees	COL video title VAL Eugene Maslov-Chan's Song(Never Said)-2000 COL description VAL A pretty quick follow-up to his first CD When I Need to Smile\, Face of Love finds Maslov incorporating guests Toots Thielemans on harmonica and Shirley Horn on vocals\, and interpreting jazz and pop music from '60s icons\, adding an occasional innocuous synth wash here and there. Eddie Gomez is back on bass for eight cuts\, and Willie Jones\, George Schuller\, and Steve Williams split up drum chores. Asserting himself as a pyrotechnist\, Maslov's fine original playing comes to the forefront; he injects hard chords and neat ideas into the up samba of Herbie Hancock and Stevie Wonder's "Chan's Song." The Miles Davis-Victor Feldman evergreen "Seven Steps to Heaven" is wittily arranged\, shifting back and forth from upbeat waltz to regular 4/4 pace. A most interesting version of the Jimmy Rowles number "The Peacocks" sports heavy\, dense textures from Gomez with Maslov's left piano hand and synth\, and slight funk by Jones. The trio dives head first with no intro into "Them There Eyes\," jump starts "The Groove Merchant" including a solo piano break\, and adopts a more contemporary samba mode for Maslov's "Through Russian Eyes." Horn sings two ballads written by Mack Street honcho Gretchen Carhartt\, the tick-tock rhythm on the unrequited love torch song of a title track\, and the regret-filled "Come Back to Me Love." Thielemans' features are the "Days of Wine & Roses"-flavored ballad "More Love" and the classic\, tender waltz "Bluesette." This CD is an improvement and a continuation along the lines of the previous recording. ~ Michael G. Nastos jazz pianist's 2nd release on Mack Avenue offers a superb selection of songs ranging from Herbie Hancock's "Never Said" to Miles Davis/Victor Feldman's "Seven Steps To Heaven\," as well as originals; inc. vocals by Grammy winner Shirley Horn\, feat. specia Recorded at Clinton Studios\, New York\, New York in May & June 1999.

COL title VAL That's How Heartaches Are Made COL performer VAL Paul Young	COL video title VAL Cliff Richard - We Don't Talk Anymore (1979) COL description VAL Britain's answer to Elvis Presley\, Richard (born Harry Webb) dominated the pre-Beatles British pop scene in the late '50s and early '60s. An accomplished singer with a genuine feel for the music\, Richard's artistic legacy is nonetheless meager\, as he was quickly steered toward a middle-of-the-road pop direction. Several of his late-'50s recordings\, however\, were genuinely exciting Presley-esque rockers -- especially his first hit\, "Move It" (1958) -- and gave British teenagers their first taste of genuine homegrown rock & roll talent. Backed by the Shadows -- clean-cut instrumental virtuosos who became legends of their own -- Richard embarked on a truly awesome string of hit singles in Britain\, scoring no less than 43 Top 20 hits between 1958 and 1969. One of these\, although it was by no means one of the more successful\, was an actual Mick Jagger/Keith Richards composition (the ballad "Blue Turns to Grey").  In his homeland\, Richard's popularity was diminished only slightly by the rise of the Beatles\, but in his prime\, he had a much rougher time in the U.S.\, hitting the Top 40 only three times (with "Living Doll" in 1959\, "It's All in the Game" in 1963\, and "Devil Woman" in 1976). Richard belatedly cracked the U.S. Top Ten in 1976 with "Devil Woman\," and racked up a few other hits ("We Don't Talk Anymore\," "Dreaming\," "A Little in Love") in a mainstream pop/rock style. He remains an institution in Britain\, where he is one of the nation's most popular all-around entertainers of all time. ~ Richie Unterberger\, All Music Guide _____________________________________ In 2008\, Richard's 50th year in music\, will see the release of the 8CD box set\, And They Said It Wouldn't Last (My 50 Years In Music). In September\, a single celebrating his 50 years in pop music\, titled * Thank you for a Lifetime has been released. On the 14th of September 2008 Thank You For A Lifetime reached No.3 on the UK music charts\, which gives Cliff a Top 3 hit in each of his six decades as a singer. On 2nd November 2008\, British newspaper The Mail on Sunday gave away a free promotional CD entitled '50th Anniversary' containing 12 tracks picked by Sir Cliff himself.

COL title VAL Hot Burrito N° 1 COL performer VAL Raul Malo - Pat Flynn - Rob Ickes - Dave Pomeroy	COL video title VAL THE RUFFIN BROTHERS -"LO & BEHOLD" (1970) COL description VAL With neither Ruffin brother experiencing significant success in the wake of their non-simultaneous departure from the Temptations\, Jimmy latched upon the idea of recording a duet album with the younger David -- partially as a way to pay tribute to their recently passed parents\, partially as a way to jump-start their stalled careers. In regards to the latter\, 1970's I Am My Brother's Keeper was no great shakes\, barely scraping the pop charts and its lead single "Stand by Me" only reaching 24 on the R&B charts\, but as a testament to the familial talents of the Ruffins\, the LP succeeds\, proving that these two great voices could enliven familiar tunes. It's a knack that's needed here\, for much of I Am My Brother's Keeper consists of splashy\, sequin-studded and polyester-draped covers of pop and R&B hits. Just under half of the album consists of versions of tunes by the Hollies\, Ben E. King\, the Delfonics and Tyrone Davis\, with the rest of the record coming from in-house Motown writers and elsewhere\, including the rousing Gloria Jones co-write "When My Love Hand Comes Down." This is one of five Bobby Taylor productions on the LP\, and he gives the Ruffins soulful\, funky sounds that showcase them at their best\, with Henry Cosby\, Duke Browner\, Frank Wilson and Al Kent responsible for the songs that edge a little closer to the pop charts. Combined\, all the producers provide a sampler of Motown sounds at the dawn of the '70s -- sometimes things are deeply funky\, sometimes things are slick enough for a televised variety revue -- but the Ruffins pull it all together\, sounding comfortable in every setting\, always commanding attention. Perhaps its underwhelming commercial performance is understandable -- there are no true knockouts here\, just a bunch of strong soul -- but I Am My Brother's Keeper is an album that seems stronger in retrospect\, as it was the last time one of the great brother teams in soul sung together so joyfully. [Hip-O Select's 2010 reissue adds the excellent unreleased "You're What I Need (Not What I Want)" -- produced by Bobby Taylor and co-written by Gloria Jones and Pamela Sawyer -- and a mix of "Stand by Me" that removes the fake live overdubs of the original.

COL title VAL Please Don't Tell Me How the Story Ends COL performer VAL Ronnie Milsap	COL video title VAL Henry Mancini -   Tiny Bubbles COL description VAL "I think there is a song out there to describe just about any situation."― Criss Jami ▼▼▼  HENRY MANCINI Enrico Nicola "Henry" Mancini was an American composer\, arranger and conductor\, who is best remembered for his film and television scores.  He won a record number of Grammy Awards\, plus a posthumous Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995. His best-known works include the jazz-idiom theme to The Pink Panther film series ("The Pink Panther Theme") and the theme to the Peter Gunn television series.  Mancini had a long collaboration with the film director Blake Edwards and won numerous Academy Awards for the songs in Edwards films\, including "Moon River" from Breakfast at Tiffany's\, "Days of Wine and Roses" and for the score to "Victor Victoria". Entering 1946\, Mancini became a pianist and arranger for the newly re-formed Glenn Miller Orchestra\, led by 'Everyman' Tex Beneke. After World War II\, Mancini broadened his skills in composition\, counterpoint\, harmony and orchestration during studies opening with the composers Ernst Krenek and Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco.  In 1952\, Mancini joined the Universal Pictures music department. During the next six years\, he contributed music to over 100 movies\, most notably The Creature from the Black Lagoon\, It Came from Outer Space\, Tarantula\, This Island Earth\, The Glenn Miller Story (for which he received his first Academy Award nomination)\, The Benny Goodman Story and Orson Welles' Touch of Evil. During this time\, he also wrote some popular songs. His first hit was a single by Guy Lombardo and His Royal Canadians titled I Won't Let You Out of My Heart. Mancini left Universal to work as an independent composer/arranger in 1958. Soon after\, he scored the television series Peter Gunn for writer/producer Blake Edwards. This was the genesis of a relationship in which Edwards and Mancini collaborated on 30 films over 35 years.  Along with Alex North\, Elmer Bernstein\, Leith Stevens and Johnny Mandel\, Henry Mancini was a pioneer of the inclusion of jazz elements in the late romantic orchestral film and TV scoring prevalent at the time. Mancini scored many TV movies\, including The Thorn Birds and The Shadow Box. He wrote many television themes\, including Mr. Lucky (starring John Vivyan and Ross Martin)\, NBC Mystery Movie\, What's Happening\, Tic Tac Dough (1990 version) and Once Is Not Enough. In the 1984--85 television season\, four series featured original Mancini themes: Newhart\, Hotel\, Remington Steele\, and Ripley's Believe It or Not. Mancini also composed the "Viewer Mail" theme for Late Night with David Letterman. Mancini composed the theme for NBC Nightly News used beginning in 1975\, and a different theme by him\, titled Salute to the President was used by NBC News for its election coverage (including primaries and conventions) from 1976 to 1992. Salute to the President was only published in a school-band arrangement\, although Mancini performed it frequently with symphony orchestras on his concert tours. Songs with music by Mancini were staples of the easy listening genre from the 1960s to the 1980s. Some of the artists who have recorded Mancini songs include Andy Williams\, Paul Anka\, Pat Boone\, Anita Bryant\, Jack Jones\, Frank Sinatra\, Perry Como\, Connie Francis\, Eydie Gorme\, Steve Lawrence\, Trini Lopez\, George Maharis\, Johnny Mathis\, Jerry Vale and Ray Conniff\, to name just a few.... Mancini recorded over 90 albums\, in styles ranging from big band to light classical to pop. Eight of these albums were certified gold by The Recording Industry Association of America. He had a 20-year contract with RCA Records\, resulting in 60 commercial record albums that made him a household name among artists of easy-listening music.  TINY BUBBLES "Tiny Bubbles" is a song written by Martin Denny and Leon Pober. It was released in 1966 by Don Ho.  It is widely considered to be Denny's most famous song.  MHO "Tiny Bubbles" is -\, with all due respect for Mr Denny\, a rather "simple" song but... hand the notes to a top arranger like Henry Mancini and .... what you get is a fabulous orchestral arrangement that\, in a way\, transforms the song into an easy floating ballad.  A particularly rich instrumentation with strings\, brass\, and all the other "standard" instruments of a large orchestra\, completed with the sound of the ukelele and harp\, so typical for the Hawaiian style music.  The Mancini chorus adds some warmth and "body" to the recording\, so\, in the end\, we get to hear a splendid version of this well known theme.   Have a great (musical) trip to "Aloha country" :) !

Banes Drums\, Percussion -- Jimmy Young  ------------------------  "Fire" is a 1968 song by Arthur Brown\, Vincent Crane\, Mike Finesilver and Peter Ker. Performed by The Crazy World of Arthur Brown\, it was released as a single and on the band's debut album\, also called The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. The single made #1 in the UK (in August 1968) and Canada. In October\, it made #2 in the US Billboard charts and #19 in Australia. It also made #6 in the Netherlands. "Fire" sold over one million copies\, and was awarded a gold disc.  The song is an example of the psychedelic rock of the period\, though its lack of guitars or bass guitar distinguished it from many of its contemporaries. The lead instrument in this case was Vincent Crane's Hammond electronic organ\, augmented by an orchestral section featuring prominent brass. The singer's opening proclamation of himself as "the god of hellfire" became a lasting epithet. The song's other memorable line is "You're Gonna Burn!!". The song ends with the sound of a wind from hell.  During live performances and in the black and white promotional television clip\, Brown performed the song wearing a burning helmet. The helmet was improvised with a leather skull cap onto which was bolted a metal dish that held lighter fluid or petrol. As the cap was not insulated\, the heat from the burning fuel quickly conducted through the fixing bolt to the top of Brown's head\, causing him considerable pain.  Two studio mixes of "Fire" have been officially released\, one in stereo and one in mono. The mono mix features no brass. Both versions are included on the CD reissue of The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. The single B-side\, "Rest Cure"\, was another track from the album.  Credit for the composition of "Fire" on the original vinyl single was to Arthur Brown and Vincent Crane only; however\, Mike Finesilver and Peter Ker successfully sued for co-credit and royalties based on melodic similarities to their song "Baby\, You're a Long Way Behind".  The song is briefly featured in the films Hot Fuzz (2007) and The Boat That Rocked (2009). It is also referenced in Julie Hearn's debut novel Follow Me Down\, and was used in the episode "Burn Victim" of My Name Is Earl.  Cover versions  The Ventures covered the song on their 1969 album Underground Fire. Lizzy Mercier Descloux covered "Fire" on her album Press Color (1979)\, drastically changing the mood and style of the track. Pete Townshend\, the single's associate producer\, covered "Fire" as a member of The Who on his 1989 album The Iron Man: A Musical. Cirith Ungol covered the song on their 1991 album Paradise Lost. The Prodigy sampled the track for "Fire/Jericho"\, which was otherwise a completely different song\, on their 1992 album Experience. Emerson\, Lake & Palmer covered the song on their 1993 4-disc compilation album The Return of the Manticore. German dark electro act AmGod covered the song several times. The most well-known version is "Fire v.2" featured on the 1994 album Half Rotten and Decayed. Though it was not a true 'cover'\, Marilyn Manson's "Lunchbox" (1995) heavily samples "Fire". UK doom metal band Cathedral covered the song on their 1996 EP Hopkins (The Witchfinder General). Die Krupps covered the song on their 1997 album Paradise Now. Dutch death metal band God Dethroned covered the song on their 1997 album The Grand Grimoire. Ozzy Osbourne included a version on his 2005 album Under Cover. The song is used in one episode of Series 3 of Monkey Dust (2005) as the Paedofinder General burns the wrongly accused paedophiles with this music in the background\, complete with bastardised lyrics. US Hip hop duo Cunninlynguists sampled the song for "Hellfire" on their 2006 album A Piece of Strange. Leningrad Cowboys covered the song in a metal style and included it on their 2006 album Zombie's Paradise. Appears in the musical Disco Inferno\, when the character Duke reveals himself to be Satan in disguise.[citation needed] Death Grips\, an experimental hip hop group backed by drummer Zach Hill\, sampled "Fire" in their song "Lord of the Game".

COL title VAL Joan of Arc COL performer VAL Leonard Cohen	COL video title VAL Joan of Arc (Leonard Cohen) - Allison Crowe w. lyrics COL description VAL On her debut album "secrets" Allison Crowe covers this Leonard Cohen song. Her voice and piano is accompanied by Jo Lundstrom (Rosehip Jam\, Black Velvet Band) on accordion. Crowe engineered the recording\, with production by Rainer Willeke (of Victoria\, B.C.'s Raindog Studios).  http://music.allisoncrowe.com/track/joan-of-arc  The photo of Allison Crowe is by Billie Woods.  MOJO magazine's December '08 issue paid tribute to "Rock's Greatest Poet" Leonard Cohen with a celebration of his "deep and moving music". Of Allison Crowe's contribution of "Joan of Arc" to its 'All Star Tribute"\, (featuring Judy Collins\, Nick Cave\, Katie Melua\, Martha Wainwright\, Dion and others)\, a cover-mount CD titled "Cohen Covered"\, MOJO says: "Once famously described by the Vancouver Courier as possessing a style akin to 'Elton John meets Edith Piaf'\, the Canadian singer-songwriter Allison Crowe is renowned for her ability to blend control and melodrama. Certainly she does so on this spirited cover of Cohen's 'Songs of Love and Hate' classic\, a track which also powerfully showcases her considerable talent as a fine interpreter of song."  "Any album that features a track from Leonard Cohen is certainly heading in the right direction. But when it is covered so beautifully\, it makes you realise what an amazing lyricist Leonard Cohen is. Joan of Arc is the Cohen song covered on this album and it's certainly in my top 10 of Cohen covers. It's also my favorite track on (Secrets)" ~ Colin Meeks\, indielaunchpad.com (USA)  Joan of Arc  Words & Music by Leonard Cohen As performed by Allison Crowe  Now the flames they followed Joan of Arc as she came riding through the dark; no moon to keep her armour bright\, no man to get her through this dark and smoky night.   She said\, "I'm tired of the war\, I want the kind of work I had before\, A wedding dress or something white to wear upon my swollen appetite."  Well\, I'm glad to hear you talk this way\, I've watched you riding every day and there is something in me that yearns to win such a cold\, such a lonesome heroine.  "And who are you?" she sternly spoke to the one beneath the smoke. "Why\, I'm fire\," he replied\, "And I love your solitude\, I love your pride."  "Well\, then\, fire make your body cold\, I'm going to give you mine to hold." And saying this she climbed inside to be his one\, to be his only bride.  Then deep into his fiery heart he took the dust of Joan of Arc\, and high above all these wedding guests he hung the ashes of her lovely wedding dress.  It was deep into his fiery heart he took the dust of Joan of Arc\, and then she clearly understood if he was fire\, oh\, she must be wood.  I saw her wince\, I saw her cry\, I saw the glory in her eye. Myself I long for love and light\, but must it come so cruel\,  must it be so bright? COL channel name VAL Allison Crowe	1

Join our Youtube: https://goo.gl/8AOGaN Join our Facebook: http://goo.gl/5oL723 Chester Arthur Burnett (June 10\, 1910 -- January 10\, 1976)\, known as Howlin' Wolf\, was an influential American blues singer\, guitarist and harmonica player. He was born in West Point\, Mississippi in an area now known as White Station. With a booming voice and looming physical presence\, Burnett is commonly ranked among the leading performers in electric blues; musician and critic Cub Koda declared\, "no one could match Howlin' Wolf for the singular ability to rock the house down to the foundation while simultaneously scaring its patrons out of its wits." A number of songs written or popularized by Burnett—such as "Smokestack Lightnin'"\, "Back Door Man"\, "Killing Floor" and "Spoonful"—have become blues and blues rock standards.

COL title VAL Sweetheart Like You COL performer VAL World Party	COL video title VAL THE RUFFIN BROTHERS -"LO & BEHOLD" (1970) COL description VAL With neither Ruffin brother experiencing significant success in the wake of their non-simultaneous departure from the Temptations\, Jimmy latched upon the idea of recording a duet album with the younger David -- partially as a way to pay tribute to their recently passed parents\, partially as a way to jump-start their stalled careers. In regards to the latter\, 1970's I Am My Brother's Keeper was no great shakes\, barely scraping the pop charts and its lead single "Stand by Me" only reaching 24 on the R&B charts\, but as a testament to the familial talents of the Ruffins\, the LP succeeds\, proving that these two great voices could enliven familiar tunes. It's a knack that's needed here\, for much of I Am My Brother's Keeper consists of splashy\, sequin-studded and polyester-draped covers of pop and R&B hits. Just under half of the album consists of versions of tunes by the Hollies\, Ben E. King\, the Delfonics and Tyrone Davis\, with the rest of the record coming from in-house Motown writers and elsewhere\, including the rousing Gloria Jones co-write "When My Love Hand Comes Down." This is one of five Bobby Taylor productions on the LP\, and he gives the Ruffins soulful\, funky sounds that showcase them at their best\, with Henry Cosby\, Duke Browner\, Frank Wilson and Al Kent responsible for the songs that edge a little closer to the pop charts. Combined\, all the producers provide a sampler of Motown sounds at the dawn of the '70s -- sometimes things are deeply funky\, sometimes things are slick enough for a televised variety revue -- but the Ruffins pull it all together\, sounding comfortable in every setting\, always commanding attention. Perhaps its underwhelming commercial performance is understandable -- there are no true knockouts here\, just a bunch of strong soul -- but I Am My Brother's Keeper is an album that seems stronger in retrospect\, as it was the last time one of the great brother teams in soul sung together so joyfully. [Hip-O Select's 2010 reissue adds the excellent unreleased "You're What I Need (Not What I Want)" -- produced by Bobby Taylor and co-written by Gloria Jones and Pamela Sawyer -- and a mix of "Stand by Me" that removes the fake live overdubs of the original.

'Spirit of '73: Rock For Choice' was put together by the activist group Feminist Majority with proceeds going to support the Becky Bell/Rosie Jimenez Campaign "to lift consent laws and federal funding restrictions that are forcing young women to turn to back-alley abortions". The compilation's title is inspired by the January 22\, 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion in the United States. The songs included are all contemporary artists of 1995 covering songs that were popular in the early 1970s.   Fun Fact: The producer of the original "Midnight At The Oasis" by Maria Muldaur was none other than That Dog singer/guitarist Anna Waronker's father\, Lenny Waronker.

COL title VAL Disorder COL performer VAL Los Planetas	COL video title VAL Eugene Maslov-Chan's Song(Never Said)-2000 COL description VAL A pretty quick follow-up to his first CD When I Need to Smile\, Face of Love finds Maslov incorporating guests Toots Thielemans on harmonica and Shirley Horn on vocals\, and interpreting jazz and pop music from '60s icons\, adding an occasional innocuous synth wash here and there. Eddie Gomez is back on bass for eight cuts\, and Willie Jones\, George Schuller\, and Steve Williams split up drum chores. Asserting himself as a pyrotechnist\, Maslov's fine original playing comes to the forefront; he injects hard chords and neat ideas into the up samba of Herbie Hancock and Stevie Wonder's "Chan's Song." The Miles Davis-Victor Feldman evergreen "Seven Steps to Heaven" is wittily arranged\, shifting back and forth from upbeat waltz to regular 4/4 pace. A most interesting version of the Jimmy Rowles number "The Peacocks" sports heavy\, dense textures from Gomez with Maslov's left piano hand and synth\, and slight funk by Jones. The trio dives head first with no intro into "Them There Eyes\," jump starts "The Groove Merchant" including a solo piano break\, and adopts a more contemporary samba mode for Maslov's "Through Russian Eyes." Horn sings two ballads written by Mack Street honcho Gretchen Carhartt\, the tick-tock rhythm on the unrequited love torch song of a title track\, and the regret-filled "Come Back to Me Love." Thielemans' features are the "Days of Wine & Roses"-flavored ballad "More Love" and the classic\, tender waltz "Bluesette." This CD is an improvement and a continuation along the lines of the previous recording. ~ Michael G. Nastos jazz pianist's 2nd release on Mack Avenue offers a superb selection of songs ranging from Herbie Hancock's "Never Said" to Miles Davis/Victor Feldman's "Seven Steps To Heaven\," as well as originals; inc. vocals by Grammy winner Shirley Horn\, feat. specia Recorded at Clinton Studios\, New York\, New York in May & June 1999.

COL title VAL Reflections COL performer VAL Michael McDonald	COL video title VAL Joanie Sommers – “Step Inside Love” (Happy Tiger) 1968 COL description VAL Written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Arranged by  Capps and produced by Joseph Porter.  Joanie\, who scored a #7 US hit with “Johnny Get Angry” in the summer of 1962\, didn’t return to Hot-100 after “When The Boys Get Together” charted in October of the same year.  Some great records followed on Warners\, however\, including the northern soul favorite\, “Don’t Pity Me” in 1965. By 1967\, Joanie was with Columbia and following year with Capitol but still the hits continued to elude her – notwithstanding the quality of her recordings.  “Step Inside Love” had been a #8 UK hit for Cilla Black during Cilla’s ten year chart run from the early 60s.  The Happy Tiger label was owned by the Flying Tiger Line\, an air freight company. The label ran from 1968-71 and was home to artists such as Donnie Brooks\, Priscilla Paris and Them.

COL title VAL What is Love COL performer VAL Jose Galisteo	COL video title VAL ♥ "She Loves Me" - by Jack Jones COL description VAL Song: She Loves Me Singer: Jack Jones  "She Loves Me" is a musical with a book by Joe Masteroff\, lyrics by Sheldon Harnick\, and music by Jerry Bock.  The musical is the fifth adaptation of the play Parfumerie by Hungarian playwright Miklos Laszlo\, following the 1940 James Stewart-Margaret Sullavan film The Shop around the Corner and the 1949 Judy Garland-Van Johnson musical version In the Good Old Summertime.   The 1978 BBC version starring Robin Ellis and Gemma Craven is worth watching too.  It would surface yet again in 1998 as the Tom Hanks-Meg Ryan feature You've Got Mail. The plot revolves around Budapest shop employees Georg Nowack and Amalia Balash who\, despite being consistently at odds with each other at work\, are unaware that each is the other's secret pen pal met through lonely-hearts ads. The musical premiered on Broadway in 1963\, and subsequently had productions in the West End in 1964 and award-winning revivals on each side of the Atlantic in the 1990s\, as well as regional productions. *** COL channel name VAL 65Seasons	0

On this freewheeling and jubilant 13-track tribute\, MTO is propelled by a dynamic cast of special guests\, including Antony Hegarty\, Bernie Worrell\, Bill Laswell\, Dean Bowman\, Martha Wainwright\, Sandra St. Victor\, Shilpa Ray and Vernon Reid\, treating Sly & The Family Stone with the same (ir)reverence it would Duke Ellington or Count Basie. By illuminating the melodic and harmonic sophistication of the iconoclast's body of work\, MTO re-imagine Sly Stone through the filter of their own "downtown NYC" aesthetic\, while still upholding the Day-Glo soul and psychedelic funk that is the backbone for classics like "M'Lady\," "Everyday People" and "Family Affair." Both the CD and LP versions of the release include extensive liner notes by Steven Bernstein and music historian Greg Tate along with never before seen photos from the recording sessions.

COL title VAL Free Man in Paris COL performer VAL John Pizzarelli	COL video title VAL Joan of Arc (Leonard Cohen) - Allison Crowe w. lyrics COL description VAL On her debut album "secrets" Allison Crowe covers this Leonard Cohen song. Her voice and piano is accompanied by Jo Lundstrom (Rosehip Jam\, Black Velvet Band) on accordion. Crowe engineered the recording\, with production by Rainer Willeke (of Victoria\, B.C.'s Raindog Studios).  http://music.allisoncrowe.com/track/joan-of-arc  The photo of Allison Crowe is by Billie Woods.  MOJO magazine's December '08 issue paid tribute to "Rock's Greatest Poet" Leonard Cohen with a celebration of his "deep and moving music". Of Allison Crowe's contribution of "Joan of Arc" to its 'All Star Tribute"\, (featuring Judy Collins\, Nick Cave\, Katie Melua\, Martha Wainwright\, Dion and others)\, a cover-mount CD titled "Cohen Covered"\, MOJO says: "Once famously described by the Vancouver Courier as possessing a style akin to 'Elton John meets Edith Piaf'\, the Canadian singer-songwriter Allison Crowe is renowned for her ability to blend control and melodrama. Certainly she does so on this spirited cover of Cohen's 'Songs of Love and Hate' classic\, a track which also powerfully showcases her considerable talent as a fine interpreter of song."  "Any album that features a track from Leonard Cohen is certainly heading in the right direction. But when it is covered so beautifully\, it makes you realise what an amazing lyricist Leonard Cohen is. Joan of Arc is the Cohen song covered on this album and it's certainly in my top 10 of Cohen covers. It's also my favorite track on (Secrets)" ~ Colin Meeks\, indielaunchpad.com (USA)  Joan of Arc  Words & Music by Leonard Cohen As performed by Allison Crowe  Now the flames they followed Joan of Arc as she came riding through the dark; no moon to keep her armour bright\, no man to get her through this dark and smoky night.   She said\, "I'm tired of the war\, I want the kind of work I had before\, A wedding dress or something white to wear upon my swollen appetite."  Well\, I'm glad to hear you talk this way\, I've watched you riding every day and there is something in me that yearns to win such a cold\, such a lonesome heroine.  "And who are you?" she sternly spoke to the one beneath the smoke. "Why\, I'm fire\," he replied\, "And I love your solitude\, I love your pride."  "Well\, then\, fire make your body cold\, I'm going to give you mine to hold." And saying this she climbed inside to be his one\, to be his only bride.  Then deep into his fiery heart he took the dust of Joan of Arc\, and high above all these wedding guests he hung the ashes of her lovely wedding dress.  It was deep into his fiery heart he took the dust of Joan of Arc\, and then she clearly understood if he was fire\, oh\, she must be wood.  I saw her wince\, I saw her cry\, I saw the glory in her eye. Myself I long for love and light\, but must it come so cruel\,  must it be so bright? COL channel name VAL Allison Crowe	0

You Got It Coming (Supertonic Remix)  ------------------------  "R.A.M.O.N.E.S." is a song first recorded by the British rock band Motörhead on their 1991 album 1916 as a tribute to their friends and contemporaries\, the Ramones. The bands were long-standing admirers of each other's work. Critic Andy Boot\, reviewing the album in Kerrang (27 February 1991) described the song as "the icing on a very fine\, if somewhat heavy\, cake."  "It was the ultimate honor - like John Lennon writing a song for you". -Joey Ramone  The track was first aired before Phil Taylor and Würzel left the band and has continued as a live staple.  Cover versions  It also appears as a bonus track on the album Fang Bang by Wednesday 13.  The Ramones also performed it on and off until their final show in August 1996 at which C.J. Ramone and Lemmy shared lead vocals. Two different studio versions were recorded. One appears as a bonus track on their album ¡Adios Amigos! with C.J. Ramone singing lead vocals and the other one on the Greatest Hits Live with Joey Ramone singing lead vocals.  The Huntingtons also covered this song on their File Under Ramones album.  "R.A.M.O.N.E.S." was also covered by the Offspring on their performance at Rock in Rio 5 on September 14\, 2013. At that show\, Marky Ramone (who was the drummer of the Ramones from 1978 to 1983\, and again from 1987 to their breakup in 1996) joined them onstage to perform cover versions of "R.A.M.O.N.E.S." and "California Sun".  ------------------------  Lyrics  New York City\, N.Y.C.

COL title VAL Buzz - Buzz - Buzz COL performer VAL Hollywood Flames	COL video title VAL The Coal Porters - Another Girl\, Another Planet (live) COL description VAL The Coal Porters play Another Girl Another Planet live in Wales\, 2014.  Another Girl Another Planet is featured on The Coal Porters new album\, No. 6. No. 6\, is produced by John Wood\, the legendary British folk-rock mastermind who recorded the classic albums of Fairport Convention\, Nick Drake\, Beth Orton and Squeeze. No. 6 is a bit of a departure for the Coal Porters as it pushes their musical boundaries further than ever before.The Coal Porters - No. 6  https://thecoalporters.com / https://thecoalporters.bandcamp.com / https://www.facebook.com/thecoalporters  This new album features Kerenza quadruple tracking herself into a string quartet\, Andrew on a ukulele\, Sid on trusty autoharp and mandolin\, both Neil and Paul on dobro\, a Byrdsy acoustic 12-string guitar\, and very emotional\, long\, sweet trumpet solo by Cuba’s noted “son y mambo” music virtuoso Eikel Venegas. There has never been music like this before. And already\, the album’s opening track\, Sid’s “The Day The Last Ramone Died\,” is being hailed as a classic.  Recorded in two creative bursts in late 2014 and in 2015 this is the Coal Porters album which took three years to incubate. Four new Sid songs\, three new Neil Bob Herd originals\, and Kerenza Peacock contributed her first recorded lead vocal on a very personal song with Play A Tune while also gracing the record with a totally catchy instrumental\, Chopping The Garlic. The album goes out on a high note with the band’s warm-hearted cover of the Only Ones’ classic hit Another Girl\, Another Planet.  No.6 was released in September 2016 and can be ordered via Amazon\, iTunes\, the Sid Griffin website and in all good records stores.  Read more about No. 6 at http://www.sidgriffin.com/2016/09/06/the-coal-porters-no-6/  The Coal Porters are also on facebook at http://www.facebook.com/The-Coal-Porters COL channel name VAL The Coal Porters	0

COL title VAL How Will I Know COL performer VAL Whitney Houston	COL video title VAL Jimmy Wilson - Please accept my love COL description VAL A very good but relatively unknown swamp pop single from the also unknown\, Jimmy Wilson. It has the surging and relentless support familar from\, say\, Cookie and the Cupcakes records\, and a lead guitarist (Wilson?) who's evidently heard of Guitar Slim. Well worth listening to. Oh and I should add that the author of the song is Clarence Garlow who at least is marginally better known than Wilson.  "The Story of Goldband Records: Eddie's House Of Hits"  is a collection issued by Ace Records (UK) which attempts to give an introduction to  Goldband Records\, owned and run by Eddie Shuler\, out of Lake Charles\, Louisiana. It was opened by Eddie in 1952 and has continued ever since. However its heyday was very much during the fifties and early sixties when Eddie achieved strong regional success with a number of singles plus one or two which went on to wider success. Goldband recorded virtually any music that was popular in the area which was a pretty wide list including blues\, R&B\, country\, rockabilly\, other forms of rock'n'roll\, swamp pop and cajun. Given that we are talking SE Louisiana many of these distinctions often blurred together and some  individual artists would skip between these genres seemingly at will.

As we drove on thru the rain As he listened I explained And he left me with a prayer That I'd find you    Disclaimer:  NO COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT INTENDED!

Clifford\, Kelleher\, O'Neill\, Yeates; (c) 1994 Four to the Bar  LYRICS Says my aul' wan to your aul' wan "Will ye come to the Waxies dargle?" Says your aul' wan to my aul' wan\, "Sure I haven't got a farthing. I've just been down to Monto town To see uncle McArdle But he half a crown For to go to the Waxies dargle."  Cho: What are ye having\, will ye have a pint? Yes\, I'll have a pint with you\, sir\, And if one of us doesn't order soon We'll be thrown out of the boozer.  Says my aul' wan to your aul' wan "Will ye come to the Galway races?" Says your aul' wan to my aul' wan\, "With the price of my aul' lad's braces. I went down to Capel Street To the Jew man moneylenders But they wouldn't give me a couple of bob on My aul' lad's suspenders."  Says my aul' wan to your aul' wan "We have no beef or mutton But if we go down to Monto town We might get a drink for nuttin'" Here's a piece of good advice I got from an aul' fishmonger: "When food is scarce and you see the hearse You'll know you have died of hunger.  Let the grasses grow and the waters flow\, In a free and easy way\, But give me enough of that rare old stuff\, That's made near Galway Bay. Come gougers all\, From Donegal\, Sligo and Leitrim too\, And we'll give you the slip as we take a sip\, Of the rare old mountain dew.  At the foot of the hill there's a neat little still\, Where the smoke curls up to the sky; By the whiff of the smell you can plainly tell There's poitin boys nearby. For it fills the air\, with a perfume rare\, That betwixt both me and you\, And as on we roll\, we'll drink a bowl\, Or a bucketfull of mountain dew.  Now learned men who use the pen Have wrote the praises high; Of the sweet poitin from Ireland green\, Distilled with wheat and rye. Forget your pills\,it will cure all ills Of the Pagan\, Christian or Jew\, Take off your coat and wet your throat With the rare old mountain dew. COL channel name VAL FourToTheBar	0

COL title VAL Bruton Town COL performer VAL Meg Baird - Helena Espvall - Sharron Kraus	COL video title VAL BERT HEERINK STORM NA DE STILTE Rocksterren COL description VAL I DO NOT OWN THIS VIDEO. © (c)Copyright belongs to the rightful owner  Bert Heerink (Utrecht\, 26 januari 1953) is een Nederlandse muzikant. Heerink werd voornamelijk bekend als zanger van de Nederlandse hardrockband Vandenberg\, die ook internationaal succes had.Met Vandenberg had Heerink in de jaren 80 twee wereldhits: Burning Heart en Different Worlds. Nadat Vandenberg de samenwerking met Heerink beëindigde trad Bert toe tot de heavy metal band Picture en nam een aantal Nederlandstalige albums op. Bekend werd hij verder door in 1995 voor een aantal reclames voor Heineken Nederlandstalige teksten te zingen op melodieën van oude rocknummers. De nummers Zon in de Winter\, Doe wat je wil en Julie July werden hits. Voor het album Storm na de Stilte kreeg hij een gouden plaat.Bij de reünie van Kayak  in 2000 werd Heerink zanger van deze band en bleef dit tot 2006. In 2002 toert Bert met het orkest van de Koninklijke Luchtmacht door Nederland in de hoofdrol van "Tommy".Met Peter Groot Kormelink en Erik Mesie vormt Heerink het muzikale feestprogramma "De Heeren van Oranje" waarin alle grote hits van de 3 Heeren voorbij komen.Bert neemt in 2005/2006 ook vocalen voor zijn rekening tijdens de succesvolle tour van het orkest van Koninklijke Luchtmacht door de Nederlandse theaters: Queen in concert\, waarbij diverse Queen klassiekers worden vertolkt. Sommige nummers worden ook in een nieuw jasje gestoken\, zoals 'Crazy little thing called love'\, welke een big band sausje krijgt.In 2006 heeft Bert Heerink samen met zijn zus Saskia onder de naam Heerink een album uitgebracht met de naam Purify. Het album wordt gekenmerkt door een persoonlijke inslag.In 2007 en ook in 2008 maakte Heerink met het Noord Nederlands Orkest (NNO) onder leiding van de Belgische dirigent Dirk Brossé met het cross-overprogramma Symphonic echoes of Pink Floyd een tournee\, waarin de grote hits van de Engelse rockformatie centraal staan. Naast Heerink nemen Antonie Kamerling en Erik Mesie de zangpartijen voor hun rekening\, bijgestaan door onder meer gitarist Joost Vergoossen.Het wordt het tot dan toe best bezochte concertjaar met ruim 98.000 bezoekers. In 2008 vervangt Chris Zeegers Antonie Kamerling bij deze productie.Tegenwoordig (2006) woont Heerink in Hoogeveen. Recentelijk bracht Heerink de single "When I close my eyes"\, uit. De single is uitsluitend via de website www.bertheerink.nl te downloaden en de opbrengst gaat naar de stichting KidsRights die zich wereldwijd inzet voor de rechten van kinderen. Op 6 december 2008 ontving Bert Heerink het Lidmaatschap in de Orde van Oranje Nassau als waardering voor zijn inzet en prestaties in de popmuziek en zijn inzet voor de kinderrechtenorganisatie KidsRights. Eerder ontving Bert Heerink in Hoogeveen om dezelfde reden een eigen ster in de "Walk of Veen".In april 2009 brengt Heerink samen met collega's Erik Mesie en Peter Groot Kormelink onder de naam "Heeren van Oranje" hun eerste eigen single uit; "Made in Holland" waarmee ze landelijk debuteerden op het Tros Muziekfeest in Middelburg. In samenwerking met OAR Heaven Records werkt Bert vanaf mei 2009 in Duitsland in de studio van Michael Voss aan een volledig eigen Engelstalig rockalbum. De uitnodiging een dergelijk album te maken kwam na het meewerken aan het tweede "Voices of Rock" album waar Bert met "Shame on you" op vertegenwoordigd is. Het album komt op 25 september wereldwijd uit en bevat nummers van grote songwriters als Jeff Silbard (Wind beneath my Wings) en Russ Ballard.In februari 2010 komt de eerste single van dit album "Panic Attack" binnen in de single top 100 waarna deze doorstijgt en hoog in de charts komt. Een tweede stuk "All fired Up" wordt tegelijkertijd door het TT Circuit Assen gekozen tot de seizoenstune. Op 3 april trad Heerink tijdens de 5e uitreiking van de Eddie Christiani Award\, die hijzelf opnieuw presenteerde\,op met Steve Lukather\, (gitarist/zanger van Toto) de winnaar van deze editie.

COL title VAL Come Down in Time COL performer VAL Lois Lane [1]	COL video title VAL Johnny Mathis ~ Southern Nights COL description VAL This upload is in honor of Johnny's recent Grammy nomination for his latest CD: "Let It Be Me: Mathis in Nashville". I love many songs on this CD - this is one of my favorites. Love Johnny's wonderful\, contagious energy  (catch that sweet 'yeehaw' moment - s'cuze me - that's what comes when I hear it! -  at about 2:35 - and that's him in those cool\, cute sneaks movin' in Cohasset this summer)\,  and the beautiful symphonic blend of his interpretation with the incredible musicians accompanying him. In researching the song I watched several videos of Jerry Douglas (Dobro)\, Bryan Sutton (Acoustic Guitar\, Banjo\, Mandolin)\, Stuart Duncan (Fiddle\, Mandolin) and others\, all like Johnny\, gifted\, and according to executive producer Jay Lander's liner notes\,  'handpicked group of Nashville's finest" by producer Fred Molin.  If you don't own it- well worth it- and the notes\, so descriptive of each song's history. And one can't improve on Lander's further notes: "Johnny Mathis draws the listener into his world like a master storyteller.....the emotions\, in Johnny's hands\, nothing less than profound." You are not listening to a set of songs put to voice and music here. If you do what country music\, I believe 'invites' you to do\,  slow down\, listen\, take in the sounds\, the meaning\, the simplicity\, the emotions and joy\, you'll hear these stories with every nuance available. Enjoy!  And I defy your feet or body to stay still listening to this rich number! And here's to Johnny\, once again\, the consummate re-inventor of his own style\,and yet always just a step away from the 'magic' core we all love.   The song\, composed by Allen Toussaint\, was released in 1977 by Glenn Campbell and hit #1 as a 'cross over' number that year in Country\, Pop and Adult Contemporary.

But I`d forget it\, I never said it. I`d pass the flower shop. Lord knows I meant to stop. But I`d say tomorrow\, perhaps tomorrow.   Tomorrow there`d be time. There`d always be another spring. Time to make her laughter ring. Time to give her everything.   For my Angelica\, my Angelica. There`s so much you never knew. So much I always meant to say\, and do\, for you\, for you. Angelica-a-a...   And then the cold winds came. And when I spoke her name. And held her near me. She couldn`t hear me...   The shadow had been cast. Too many springs had passed. For Angelica\, sweet Angelica. Now in my silent room\, I tend the flowers that I`d buy. As they slowly fade and die. Watered by the tears I cry.   For my Angelica\, my Angelica.

COL title VAL Bella notte COL performer VAL Ruby Summer	COL video title VAL Randy California / Kapt. Kopter &  The (Fabulous) Twirly Birds - Mother And Child Reunion COL description VAL Randy California (наст. имя Randy Craig Wolfe; Лос-Анджелес\, 20 февраля 1951 - 2 января 1997) был гитарист\, вокалист и автор песен рок-группы Spirit\, созданной в 1967 году. Входит в список "100 лучших гитаристов мира" по версии журнала Classic Rock. Сценический псевдоним "Рэнди Калифорния" дал ему (в 15 лет) Джими Хендрикс\, чтобы можно было отличить от другого Рэнди в тогдашней группе Хендрикса Jimmy James and the Blue Flames (второго Рэнди Хендрикс называл "Рэнди Техас"). После ухода из группы Spirit (июль 1971) Рэнди начал сольную карьеру\, подписал контракт с Epic и выпустил осенью 1972 года альбом Kapt. Kopter and the (Fabulous) Twirly Birds. Музыка - Хендриксо-подобная\, с импровизациями\, кроме того здесь на некоторых треках играет басист Noel Redding (ex-Jimi Hendrix Experience). Следует отметить\, что на этой пластинке некоторые известные музыканты записаны под псевдонимами. С Эдом Кэссиди (своим отчимом) и басистом Ларри Найтом (Larry «Fuzzy» Knight) он провёл в Европе гастроли в поддержку своей пластинки. Но не совсем удачные\, так как Калифорния оказался неважным промоутером... Трио\, кроме того\, подготовило концептуальный альбом Potatoland\, но лейбл его отверг и Калифорния на некоторое время ушёл из музыкального бизнеса\, поселившись на Гавайях.

Now I had a woman Lord\, she lived down by the mine\, She ain't never seen the sun\, Oh Lord\, never stopped crying.  Then one day my woman up and died\, Lord\, she up and died now. Oh Lord\, she up and died now. She wanted to die\, And the only way to fly is die\, die\, die.  There's a high flyin' bird\, flying way up in the sky\, And I wonder if she looks down as she goes on by? Well\, she's flying so freely in the sky.  Lord\, look at me here\, I'm rooted like a tree here\, Got those sit-down\, can't cry\, Oh\, Lord\, gonna die blues." COL channel name VAL hereticdt	0

"El Chispa" Cervantes  (Bass); Rayhner Lasserie (Timbale); Luis Amaurys Leyva Suarez (Tres); Yanko Pizaco & Alexander Valdes Sarduy (Trumpet:);Yamil Rivero Cardenas &  Joel Sago Bell (Trombone) and backing vocals from Danaily Hernandes Del Valle\, Rayhner Lasserie\, Lazaro Antonio Rodriguez\, Tasita D'Mour and Claudio Passavanti himself.

COL title VAL Living on Video COL performer VAL Fidget	COL video title VAL Cliff Richard - We Don't Talk Anymore (1979) COL description VAL Britain's answer to Elvis Presley\, Richard (born Harry Webb) dominated the pre-Beatles British pop scene in the late '50s and early '60s. An accomplished singer with a genuine feel for the music\, Richard's artistic legacy is nonetheless meager\, as he was quickly steered toward a middle-of-the-road pop direction. Several of his late-'50s recordings\, however\, were genuinely exciting Presley-esque rockers -- especially his first hit\, "Move It" (1958) -- and gave British teenagers their first taste of genuine homegrown rock & roll talent. Backed by the Shadows -- clean-cut instrumental virtuosos who became legends of their own -- Richard embarked on a truly awesome string of hit singles in Britain\, scoring no less than 43 Top 20 hits between 1958 and 1969. One of these\, although it was by no means one of the more successful\, was an actual Mick Jagger/Keith Richards composition (the ballad "Blue Turns to Grey").  In his homeland\, Richard's popularity was diminished only slightly by the rise of the Beatles\, but in his prime\, he had a much rougher time in the U.S.\, hitting the Top 40 only three times (with "Living Doll" in 1959\, "It's All in the Game" in 1963\, and "Devil Woman" in 1976). Richard belatedly cracked the U.S. Top Ten in 1976 with "Devil Woman\," and racked up a few other hits ("We Don't Talk Anymore\," "Dreaming\," "A Little in Love") in a mainstream pop/rock style. He remains an institution in Britain\, where he is one of the nation's most popular all-around entertainers of all time. ~ Richie Unterberger\, All Music Guide _____________________________________ In 2008\, Richard's 50th year in music\, will see the release of the 8CD box set\, And They Said It Wouldn't Last (My 50 Years In Music). In September\, a single celebrating his 50 years in pop music\, titled * Thank you for a Lifetime has been released. On the 14th of September 2008 Thank You For A Lifetime reached No.3 on the UK music charts\, which gives Cliff a Top 3 hit in each of his six decades as a singer. On 2nd November 2008\, British newspaper The Mail on Sunday gave away a free promotional CD entitled '50th Anniversary' containing 12 tracks picked by Sir Cliff himself.

Buy your SIGNED copy here: http://stix-shop.dk/ More info: http://www.pasborg.dk/  ''Stefan Pasborg is yet another Nordic artist gradually raising his profile across international borders as he leads his new five-piece outfit around Europe.... Most pieces exploited the players' individual virtuosity\, but in principle the writing for the group emphasized collectivity rather than individuality\, always knitted tightly by Pasborg's strong drumming.... Odessa 5 is certainly a band to be blown away by''  - All About Jazz\, USA.   Stefan Pasborg's band Odessa ''X-tra Large'' features some of the finest musicians on the Nordic jazz scenes. Musicians that aren't afraid to cross new musical land. Together they play some seriously exiting multi-jazz. The bodily and the imagination is the main focus\, and you have to travel all the way back in time to Charles Mingus to find the same kind of energy. There is not so much more to say other than when the musicians are having fun\, as they so obviously have in this case\, then the listener has as well. COL channel name VAL copentube	0

COL title VAL Heaven Is a Place on Earth COL performer VAL Elvenking	COL video title VAL Jimmy Wilson - Please accept my love COL description VAL A very good but relatively unknown swamp pop single from the also unknown\, Jimmy Wilson. It has the surging and relentless support familar from\, say\, Cookie and the Cupcakes records\, and a lead guitarist (Wilson?) who's evidently heard of Guitar Slim. Well worth listening to. Oh and I should add that the author of the song is Clarence Garlow who at least is marginally better known than Wilson.  "The Story of Goldband Records: Eddie's House Of Hits"  is a collection issued by Ace Records (UK) which attempts to give an introduction to  Goldband Records\, owned and run by Eddie Shuler\, out of Lake Charles\, Louisiana. It was opened by Eddie in 1952 and has continued ever since. However its heyday was very much during the fifties and early sixties when Eddie achieved strong regional success with a number of singles plus one or two which went on to wider success. Goldband recorded virtually any music that was popular in the area which was a pretty wide list including blues\, R&B\, country\, rockabilly\, other forms of rock'n'roll\, swamp pop and cajun. Given that we are talking SE Louisiana many of these distinctions often blurred together and some  individual artists would skip between these genres seemingly at will.

COL title VAL Some Broken Hearts COL performer VAL Bellamy Brothers	COL video title VAL Doug Sahm - Buzz buzz buzz COL description VAL "Buzz buzz buzz" - many a great single was little more than a few nonsense words cobbled together. This single from the Hollywood Flames in '57 is a great example. And Doug and the boys give it a suitably rip-snorting treatment.  Doug Sahm was an artist who displayed a remarkable capacity for soaking up a wide variety of genres of popular music and demonstrating expertise in such genres\, often within one album.  Outside of a core set of enthusiastic admirers it is just this ability not to be typecast that may well have hampered his acceptance within the wider public domain. Relatively late in his career he recorded a small number of albums which concentrated on one genre or era of music. "Juke Box Music" is one of those albums. It focuses on music that was popular in the Southern US in the fifties. Much of this comes under the broad headings of R&B or doo-wop. The concept of the album is of a jukebox in that timeframe stacked to the gills with great music to dance or smooch to. Doug assembled an ace big band to interpret this music containing many musicians who'd been part of his various ventures in the past.  The main musicians appearing on the album are:  Doug Sahm - Vocals\, Piano & Guitar Rocky Morales - Tenor Sax Charlie McBurney - Trumpet Jack Barber - Bass George Rains - Drums  Addition musicians include:  Wayne Bennett - Guitar Derek O'Brien - Rhythm Guitar Mel Brown - Keyboards Reese Wynans - Keyboards Randy Garibay - Vocal duet Angela Strehli - Background vocals  Produced by George Rains Arrangements by Doug Sahm COL channel name VAL DangerousDaveRR	0

Les Paul had recorded an instrumental version two years earlier. The website carolinacotton.org says\, "The next MGM session took place in New York\, in August 1952. For this recording\, no expense was spared...Carolina recorded 2 songs with the LeRoy Holmes Orchestra. "Nola" was a true showcase of her yodeling talent. It even featured a technological breakthrough\, "sound-on-sound" (this was before the days of common multitracking)\, giving the illusion of her yodels echoing across the mountaintops."  http://www.carolinacotton.org/music.html http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012CIW1O/ http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043367KM/ https://www.facebook.com/pages/Carolina-Cotton/145578387436 COL channel name VAL Phil Pebcak	0

COL title VAL Can't Get You out of My Head COL performer VAL Scala	COL video title VAL BIG BAD JOHN ~ Jimmy Dean  (1961) COL description VAL BIG BAD JOHN ~ Jimmy Dean  (1961) Columbia # CL 1735   Jimmy Dean - (August 10\, 1928 – June 13\, 2010) Birth name: Jimmy Ray Dean  Birth place: Plainview\, Texas Place of death: Varina\, Virginia (at 81 years old)  Per the notes written on the back of the JIMMY DEAN: BIG BAD JOHN AND OTHER FABULOUS SONGS AND TALES (Columbia LP #CL 1735) record jacket\, it states:  "Jimmy Dean had been thinking for some time of writing a song about a PAUL BUNYAN-like hero.  He began writing the lyrics at home\, but never quite finished them\, because he had to fly to Nashville\, Tennessee for a recording session with veteran Columbia producer\, Don Law. Jimmy simply brought along the unfinished song. By the time he got off the plane\, he was virtually jumping with excitement. The song was completed and Don Law liked it so much\, that Big Bad John was recorded immediately" - (Side note: There's a little touch of "Sixteen Tons" by Tennessee Ernie Ford here as well) -  Note: What many today call\, "rapping" was originally\, in a cleaner form\, referred to as\,  "calling". Talking in rhyming sentences or speaking the lyrics instead of singing them\, which was very common in Country & Western music. It began with the square dance "caller" who gave direction to the dancers\, through rhyming sentences set to the cadence or beat of the music being played by a live band. He never sang\, he just spoke the words in rhyme. Much the same as a auction house auctioneer\, who speaks the bids in a fast rhythm\, choosing words which often rhyme.  The "caller" and the dance can be:  "traced back through England  to the old French cotillions" (17th century) (per Lloyd Shaw-1939). Also\, a form of "calling" or "auction house crying" can be found in the 1947 recording of\, "Smoke\, Smoke\, Smoke (That Cigarette) (Tex Williams & Phil Harris) or "The Darktown Poker Club" (1946) (Phil Harris) for example\, and many other older recordings. Therefore\, "rap" isn't new\, it's just a continuation of something which started many years earlier. (* No one has ever said this\,  but I believe\, "Cajun Doll"\, by Lattie Moore\,  may have inspired the writing of both "Big Bad John" and "The Cajun Queen". ) COL channel name VAL MrRJDB1969	0

It has the surging and relentless support familar from\, say\, Cookie and the Cupcakes records\, and a lead guitarist (Wilson?) who's evidently heard of Guitar Slim. Well worth listening to. Oh and I should add that the author of the song is Clarence Garlow who at least is marginally better known than Wilson.  "The Story of Goldband Records: Eddie's House Of Hits"  is a collection issued by Ace Records (UK) which attempts to give an introduction to  Goldband Records\, owned and run by Eddie Shuler\, out of Lake Charles\, Louisiana. It was opened by Eddie in 1952 and has continued ever since. However its heyday was very much during the fifties and early sixties when Eddie achieved strong regional success with a number of singles plus one or two which went on to wider success. Goldband recorded virtually any music that was popular in the area which was a pretty wide list including blues\, R&B\, country\, rockabilly\, other forms of rock'n'roll\, swamp pop and cajun. Given that we are talking SE Louisiana many of these distinctions often blurred together and some  individual artists would skip between these genres seemingly at will.

COL title VAL Lonesome Traveller COL performer VAL Paperboys	COL video title VAL Henry Mancini -   Tiny Bubbles COL description VAL "I think there is a song out there to describe just about any situation."― Criss Jami ▼▼▼  HENRY MANCINI Enrico Nicola "Henry" Mancini was an American composer\, arranger and conductor\, who is best remembered for his film and television scores.  He won a record number of Grammy Awards\, plus a posthumous Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995. His best-known works include the jazz-idiom theme to The Pink Panther film series ("The Pink Panther Theme") and the theme to the Peter Gunn television series.  Mancini had a long collaboration with the film director Blake Edwards and won numerous Academy Awards for the songs in Edwards films\, including "Moon River" from Breakfast at Tiffany's\, "Days of Wine and Roses" and for the score to "Victor Victoria". Entering 1946\, Mancini became a pianist and arranger for the newly re-formed Glenn Miller Orchestra\, led by 'Everyman' Tex Beneke. After World War II\, Mancini broadened his skills in composition\, counterpoint\, harmony and orchestration during studies opening with the composers Ernst Krenek and Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco.  In 1952\, Mancini joined the Universal Pictures music department. During the next six years\, he contributed music to over 100 movies\, most notably The Creature from the Black Lagoon\, It Came from Outer Space\, Tarantula\, This Island Earth\, The Glenn Miller Story (for which he received his first Academy Award nomination)\, The Benny Goodman Story and Orson Welles' Touch of Evil. During this time\, he also wrote some popular songs. His first hit was a single by Guy Lombardo and His Royal Canadians titled I Won't Let You Out of My Heart. Mancini left Universal to work as an independent composer/arranger in 1958. Soon after\, he scored the television series Peter Gunn for writer/producer Blake Edwards. This was the genesis of a relationship in which Edwards and Mancini collaborated on 30 films over 35 years.  Along with Alex North\, Elmer Bernstein\, Leith Stevens and Johnny Mandel\, Henry Mancini was a pioneer of the inclusion of jazz elements in the late romantic orchestral film and TV scoring prevalent at the time. Mancini scored many TV movies\, including The Thorn Birds and The Shadow Box. He wrote many television themes\, including Mr. Lucky (starring John Vivyan and Ross Martin)\, NBC Mystery Movie\, What's Happening\, Tic Tac Dough (1990 version) and Once Is Not Enough. In the 1984--85 television season\, four series featured original Mancini themes: Newhart\, Hotel\, Remington Steele\, and Ripley's Believe It or Not. Mancini also composed the "Viewer Mail" theme for Late Night with David Letterman. Mancini composed the theme for NBC Nightly News used beginning in 1975\, and a different theme by him\, titled Salute to the President was used by NBC News for its election coverage (including primaries and conventions) from 1976 to 1992. Salute to the President was only published in a school-band arrangement\, although Mancini performed it frequently with symphony orchestras on his concert tours. Songs with music by Mancini were staples of the easy listening genre from the 1960s to the 1980s. Some of the artists who have recorded Mancini songs include Andy Williams\, Paul Anka\, Pat Boone\, Anita Bryant\, Jack Jones\, Frank Sinatra\, Perry Como\, Connie Francis\, Eydie Gorme\, Steve Lawrence\, Trini Lopez\, George Maharis\, Johnny Mathis\, Jerry Vale and Ray Conniff\, to name just a few.... Mancini recorded over 90 albums\, in styles ranging from big band to light classical to pop. Eight of these albums were certified gold by The Recording Industry Association of America. He had a 20-year contract with RCA Records\, resulting in 60 commercial record albums that made him a household name among artists of easy-listening music.  TINY BUBBLES "Tiny Bubbles" is a song written by Martin Denny and Leon Pober. It was released in 1966 by Don Ho.  It is widely considered to be Denny's most famous song.  MHO "Tiny Bubbles" is -\, with all due respect for Mr Denny\, a rather "simple" song but... hand the notes to a top arranger like Henry Mancini and .... what you get is a fabulous orchestral arrangement that\, in a way\, transforms the song into an easy floating ballad.  A particularly rich instrumentation with strings\, brass\, and all the other "standard" instruments of a large orchestra\, completed with the sound of the ukelele and harp\, so typical for the Hawaiian style music.  The Mancini chorus adds some warmth and "body" to the recording\, so\, in the end\, we get to hear a splendid version of this well known theme.   Have a great (musical) trip to "Aloha country" :) !

It was also used as the B-side of their 1967 single "All You Need Is Love". New mixes of the song were made available on the compilation albums Magical Mystery Tour and Yellow Submarine Songtrack.  Composition  Two song fragments were combined to create "Baby\, You're a Rich Man". The verses from "One of the Beautiful People" by John Lennon were combined with Paul McCartney's previously unaccompanied "Baby\, you're a rich man ..." chorus. Two songs were combined in a similar fashion to make "A Day in the Life"\, and "I've Got a Feeling".  Recording  The song was recorded and mixed (in mono) on 11 May 1967 at Olympic Sound Studios. The music featured an unusual oboe-like sound which was created with a clavioline (an early forerunner of the synthesiser) and a spin-echo (feed back delay) effect which was used to fill from the end of one line of the verse to the start of the next.  Personnel  Per Lewisohn & MacDonald:  John Lennon -- double-tracked vocal\, clavioline\, piano Paul McCartney -- harmony vocal\, piano\, bass George Harrison -- harmony vocal\, guitar\, handclaps Ringo Starr -- drums\, tambourine\, maracas\, handclaps Brian Jones -- oboe Eddie Kramer -- vibraphone George Martin -- producer Keith Grant -- engineer  Mick Jagger was also present and his name appears on a session tape box\, possibly indicating that he provided backing vocals near the end of the song.

Now that you know who you are What do you want to be? And have you travelled very far? Far as the eye can see. How does it feel to be One of the beautiful people? How often have you been there? Often enough to know. What did you see\, when you were there? Nothing that doesn't show. Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man too. You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo. What a thing to do. Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man too. How does it feel to be One of the beautiful people? Tuned to a natural E Happy to be that way. Now that you've found another key What are you going to play? Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man\, Baby you're a rich man too. You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo. What a thing to do. Baby you're a rich man...

COL title VAL Buzz Me Blues COL performer VAL Veronica Martell	COL video title VAL Eugene Maslov-Chan's Song(Never Said)-2000 COL description VAL A pretty quick follow-up to his first CD When I Need to Smile\, Face of Love finds Maslov incorporating guests Toots Thielemans on harmonica and Shirley Horn on vocals\, and interpreting jazz and pop music from '60s icons\, adding an occasional innocuous synth wash here and there. Eddie Gomez is back on bass for eight cuts\, and Willie Jones\, George Schuller\, and Steve Williams split up drum chores. Asserting himself as a pyrotechnist\, Maslov's fine original playing comes to the forefront; he injects hard chords and neat ideas into the up samba of Herbie Hancock and Stevie Wonder's "Chan's Song." The Miles Davis-Victor Feldman evergreen "Seven Steps to Heaven" is wittily arranged\, shifting back and forth from upbeat waltz to regular 4/4 pace. A most interesting version of the Jimmy Rowles number "The Peacocks" sports heavy\, dense textures from Gomez with Maslov's left piano hand and synth\, and slight funk by Jones. The trio dives head first with no intro into "Them There Eyes\," jump starts "The Groove Merchant" including a solo piano break\, and adopts a more contemporary samba mode for Maslov's "Through Russian Eyes." Horn sings two ballads written by Mack Street honcho Gretchen Carhartt\, the tick-tock rhythm on the unrequited love torch song of a title track\, and the regret-filled "Come Back to Me Love." Thielemans' features are the "Days of Wine & Roses"-flavored ballad "More Love" and the classic\, tender waltz "Bluesette." This CD is an improvement and a continuation along the lines of the previous recording. ~ Michael G.

COL title VAL Webb City COL performer VAL The Be Bop Boys	COL video title VAL Doug Sahm - Buzz buzz buzz COL description VAL "Buzz buzz buzz" - many a great single was little more than a few nonsense words cobbled together. This single from the Hollywood Flames in '57 is a great example. And Doug and the boys give it a suitably rip-snorting treatment.  Doug Sahm was an artist who displayed a remarkable capacity for soaking up a wide variety of genres of popular music and demonstrating expertise in such genres\, often within one album.  Outside of a core set of enthusiastic admirers it is just this ability not to be typecast that may well have hampered his acceptance within the wider public domain. Relatively late in his career he recorded a small number of albums which concentrated on one genre or era of music. "Juke Box Music" is one of those albums. It focuses on music that was popular in the Southern US in the fifties. Much of this comes under the broad headings of R&B or doo-wop. The concept of the album is of a jukebox in that timeframe stacked to the gills with great music to dance or smooch to. Doug assembled an ace big band to interpret this music containing many musicians who'd been part of his various ventures in the past.  The main musicians appearing on the album are:  Doug Sahm - Vocals\, Piano & Guitar Rocky Morales - Tenor Sax Charlie McBurney - Trumpet Jack Barber - Bass George Rains - Drums  Addition musicians include:  Wayne Bennett - Guitar Derek O'Brien - Rhythm Guitar Mel Brown - Keyboards Reese Wynans - Keyboards Randy Garibay - Vocal duet Angela Strehli - Background vocals  Produced by George Rains Arrangements by Doug Sahm COL channel name VAL DangerousDaveRR	0

COL title VAL If This World Were Mine COL performer VAL Alicia Keys featuring Jermaine Paul	COL video title VAL Ronnie Aldrich and His Orchestra - What is life COL description VAL Ronnie Aldrich and His Orchestra (in this case\, the "London Festival Orchestra") bring you this fantastic arrangement of George Harrison's second successful single "What is life ?"  Harrison wrote the song in 1969 for Billy Preston\, but decided to include the composition in his own solo album "All things must pass".  The track became a Top 10 hit in many European countries\, and even in the US.  Ronnie Aldrich (who started playing the piano at age 3 ! ) started his musical career in the 1940's when he formed the band "Ronnie Aldrich and the Squadronaires" (with the word "squadron" appearing in the band's name looks like WWII played an important part here...).  The Squadronaires kept performing until 1964 and then Aldrich signed a contract with Decca. Here he issued more than 30 albums during the late 1960's (and up to his death in 1977) as "Ronnie Aldrich and the two pianos".  These two pianos (alternately to be heard on the left and right channel) conquered a large part of the easy listening audience and hence Aldrich became increasingly popular.  Being a talented composer\, arranger\, conductor and pianist\,  he also often appeared on BBC Radio.  Later\, he became musical director of Thames Television (and was appointed music supervisor for the famous "Benny Hill Show"). From the 1971 album "Love story" here is Ronnie Aldrich with a fabulously arranged version of George Harrison's "What is life".  Enjoy ! COL channel name VAL Socratess2007	0

COL title VAL Blue Canadian Rockies COL performer VAL The Byrds	COL video title VAL Average White Band ~ If I Ever Lose This Heaven "1975" Funk COL description VAL Their self-effacing name to the contrary\, Average White Band was anything but -- one of the few white groups to cross the color line and achieve success and credibility playing funk\, with their tight\, fiery sound also belying their Scottish heritage\, evoking American R&B hotbeds like Detroit\, Memphis\, and Philadelphia instead. Singer/bassist Alan Gorrie\, guitarists Hamish Stuart and Onnie McIntyre\, tenor saxophonist Malcolm Duncan\, keyboardist/saxophonist Roger Ball\, and drummer Robbie McIntosh comprised the original Average White Band lineup. Veterans of numerous Scottish soul and jazz groups\, they made their debut in 1973 as the opening act at Eric Clapton's Rainbow Theatre comeback gig\, soon issuing their debut LP\, Show Your Hand\, to little notice. After adopting the abbreviated moniker AWB\, a year later the band issued their self-titled sophomore effort\, topping the American pop charts with the Arif Mardin-produced instrumental "Pick Up the Pieces." The record's mammoth success was nevertheless tempered by the September 23\, 1974 death of McIntosh\, who died at a Hollywood party after overdosing on heroin.  Cut the Cake Ex-Bloodstone drummer Steve Ferrone replaced McIntosh for AWB's third album\, 1975's Cut the Cake\, which scored a Top Ten hit with its title track as well as two other chart entries\, "If I Ever Lose This Heaven" and "School Boy Crush." (Put It Where You Want It\, issued later that same year\, was simply a retitled and repackaged Show Your Hand.) With 1976's Soul Searching\, the group reclaimed the full Average White Band name\, scoring their final Top 40 hit with "Queen of My Soul." Following the live Person to Person\, they issued Benny & Us\, a collaboration with soul legend Ben E. King. However\, after subsequent outings\, including 1978's Warmer Communications\, 1979's Feel No Fret\, and 1980's Shine\, failed to recapture the energy of AWB's peak\, the group dissolved in 1982\, with Ferrone later joining Duran Duran and Stuart recording with Paul McCartney. Gorrie\, Ball\, and McIntyre reformed Average White Band in 1989\, tapping vocalist Alex Ligertwood for their comeback effort Aftershock. Oft-sampled by hip-hop producers throughout the 1990s\, the group continued touring prior to releasing Soul Tattoo in 1996. The live album\, Face to Face\, followed three years later.

Man gave names to all the animals\, In the beginning\, a long time ago.  He saw an animal that liked to growl\, Big furry paws and he liked to howl. Great big furry back and furry hair\, I think I'll call it a bear.  Man gave names to all the animals\, In the beginning\, in the beginning. Man gave names to all the animals\, In the beginning\, a long time ago.  He saw an animal up on the hill\, Chewing up so much grass until she was filled. He saw milk coming out but didn't know how\, He said I think I'll call it a cow.  Man gave names to all the animals\, In the beginning\, in the beginning. Man gave names to all the animals\, In the beginning\, a long time ago.  He saw an animal that liked to snort\, Horns on his head and they weren't too short. And it looked like there was nothing he couldn't pull\, He said I think I'll call it a bull.  Man gave names to all the animals\, In the beginning\, in the beginning. Man gave names to all the animals\, In the beginning\, a long time ago.  He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail\, Real dirty face and a curly tail. He wasn't too small\, he wasn't too big\, He said I think I'll call it a pig.  Man gave names to all the animals\, In the beginning\, in the beginning. Man gave names to all the animals\, In the beginning\, a long time ago.  Next animal that he did meet\, Had wool on his back and hooves on his feet. Eating grass on a mountain side so steep\, He said I'm gonna call that one a sheep.  Man gave names to all the animals\, In the beginning\, in the beginning. Man gave names to all the animals\, In the beginning\, a long time ago.  He saw an animal as smooth as glass\, Slithering his way through the grass. He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake\, Ahhh.

It was written By Redd Stewart and Ernest Tubb.  In 1941\, following the attack on Pearl Harbor\, Redd was drafted into the U.S. Army and sent to the South Pacific. While stationed there with the rank of sergeant\, Redd wrote "A Soldier's Last Letter"\, which Ernest Tubb worked on and recorded in 1944\, making it a No.1 hit staying at the top for four weeks out of a seven month stay on the Country charts\, and crossing over to the Pop chart Top 20. The B-side of the Ernest Tubb recording of "Soldiers Last Letter" a song entitled\, "Yesterday's Tears" peaked at number four on the Juke Box Folk chart. Merle Haggard later had a hit single with the song in 1970. COL channel name VAL althazarr's good time oldies	0
COL title VAL Police on My Back COL performer VAL Asian Dub Foundation & Zebda	COL video title VAL Jerry Lee Lewis - Let's Talk About Us COL description VAL Jerry Lee Lewis (born September 29\, 1935) is an American singer-songwriter\, musician\, and pianist\, who is often known by his nickname of The Killer and is often viewed as "rock & roll's first great wild man." As an early pioneer of rock and roll music\, in 1956 Lewis made his first recordings at Sun Records in Memphis. "Crazy Arms" sold 300\,000 copies in the South\, but it was his 1957 hit "Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On" that shot Lewis to fame worldwide. Lewis followed this when he recorded songs such as "Great Balls of Fire"\, "Breathless" and "High School Confidential". However\, Lewis's rock and roll career faltered in the wake of his marriage to his 13-year-old cousin when he was 22. He had little success in the charts following the scandal and his popularity quickly faded. His live performance fees plummeted from $10\,000 per night to $250. In the meantime he was determined to gain back some of his popularity. During the early 1960s he didn't have much chart success with few exceptions such as "What'd I Say". His live performances at this time were increasingly wild and energetic. His album Live at the Star Club\, Hamburg from 1964 is often regarded by many music journalists and fans as one of the wildest and greatest rock and roll concert albums ever. After recording songs such as "I'm on Fire" for several years with little success\, in 1968 Lewis made a transition into country music and had hits with songs such as "Another Place\, Another Time". This reignited his career and throughout the late 1960s and 1970s he regularly topped the country-western charts. His No. 1 country hits included "To Make Love Sweeter For You"\, "There Must Be More to Love Than This"\, "Would You Take Another Chance on Me" and "Me and Bobby McGee" COL channel name VAL Music Legends Book	0

COL title VAL Cent mille chansons COL performer VAL Frida Boccara	COL video title VAL Eugene Maslov-Chan's Song(Never Said)-2000 COL description VAL A pretty quick follow-up to his first CD When I Need to Smile\, Face of Love finds Maslov incorporating guests Toots Thielemans on harmonica and Shirley Horn on vocals\, and interpreting jazz and pop music from '60s icons\, adding an occasional innocuous synth wash here and there. Eddie Gomez is back on bass for eight cuts\, and Willie Jones\, George Schuller\, and Steve Williams split up drum chores. Asserting himself as a pyrotechnist\, Maslov's fine original playing comes to the forefront; he injects hard chords and neat ideas into the up samba of Herbie Hancock and Stevie Wonder's "Chan's Song." The Miles Davis-Victor Feldman evergreen "Seven Steps to Heaven" is wittily arranged\, shifting back and forth from upbeat waltz to regular 4/4 pace. A most interesting version of the Jimmy Rowles number "The Peacocks" sports heavy\, dense textures from Gomez with Maslov's left piano hand and synth\, and slight funk by Jones. The trio dives head first with no intro into "Them There Eyes\," jump starts "The Groove Merchant" including a solo piano break\, and adopts a more contemporary samba mode for Maslov's "Through Russian Eyes." Horn sings two ballads written by Mack Street honcho Gretchen Carhartt\, the tick-tock rhythm on the unrequited love torch song of a title track\, and the regret-filled "Come Back to Me Love." Thielemans' features are the "Days of Wine & Roses"-flavored ballad "More Love" and the classic\, tender waltz "Bluesette." This CD is an improvement and a continuation along the lines of the previous recording. ~ Michael G. Nastos jazz pianist's 2nd release on Mack Avenue offers a superb selection of songs ranging from Herbie Hancock's "Never Said" to Miles Davis/Victor Feldman's "Seven Steps To Heaven\," as well as originals; inc. vocals by Grammy winner Shirley Horn\, feat. specia Recorded at Clinton Studios\, New York\, New York in May & June 1999.

COL title VAL The Shape I'm In COL performer VAL Ryno Rockers	COL video title VAL THE RUFFIN BROTHERS -"LO & BEHOLD" (1970) COL description VAL With neither Ruffin brother experiencing significant success in the wake of their non-simultaneous departure from the Temptations\, Jimmy latched upon the idea of recording a duet album with the younger David -- partially as a way to pay tribute to their recently passed parents\, partially as a way to jump-start their stalled careers. In regards to the latter\, 1970's I Am My Brother's Keeper was no great shakes\, barely scraping the pop charts and its lead single "Stand by Me" only reaching 24 on the R&B charts\, but as a testament to the familial talents of the Ruffins\, the LP succeeds\, proving that these two great voices could enliven familiar tunes. It's a knack that's needed here\, for much of I Am My Brother's Keeper consists of splashy\, sequin-studded and polyester-draped covers of pop and R&B hits. Just under half of the album consists of versions of tunes by the Hollies\, Ben E. King\, the Delfonics and Tyrone Davis\, with the rest of the record coming from in-house Motown writers and elsewhere\, including the rousing Gloria Jones co-write "When My Love Hand Comes Down." This is one of five Bobby Taylor productions on the LP\, and he gives the Ruffins soulful\, funky sounds that showcase them at their best\, with Henry Cosby\, Duke Browner\, Frank Wilson and Al Kent responsible for the songs that edge a little closer to the pop charts. Combined\, all the producers provide a sampler of Motown sounds at the dawn of the '70s -- sometimes things are deeply funky\, sometimes things are slick enough for a televised variety revue -- but the Ruffins pull it all together\, sounding comfortable in every setting\, always commanding attention. Perhaps its underwhelming commercial performance is understandable -- there are no true knockouts here\, just a bunch of strong soul -- but I Am My Brother's Keeper is an album that seems stronger in retrospect\, as it was the last time one of the great brother teams in soul sung together so joyfully. [Hip-O Select's 2010 reissue adds the excellent unreleased "You're What I Need (Not What I Want)" -- produced by Bobby Taylor and co-written by Gloria Jones and Pamela Sawyer -- and a mix of "Stand by Me" that removes the fake live overdubs of the original.
