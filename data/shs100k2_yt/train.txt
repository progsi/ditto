Suicide is painless  It brings on many changes  And I can take or leave it if I please   And you can do the same thing if you please. COL channel name VAL leendot	0

Welle: Erdball -- Ganz In Weiß  ------------------------  "Walk on the Wild Side" is a Lou Reed song from his 1972 second solo album Transformer. It was produced by David Bowie. The song received wide radio coverage\, despite its touching on taboo topics such as transsexuality\, drugs\, male prostitutes and oral sex and the term "colored" to refer to African Americans. In the United States\, RCA released an edited version of song as a single which eliminated the song's reference to oral sex.  It is usually regarded as Reed's best-known solo work. The song reached #16 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100\, and #10 in the UK. In 2003\, the song was ranked #221 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.  Covers  This song was covered by Company B\, on their album "Jam on Me." In February 1990\, two club/hiphop versions charted simultaneously in the UK - Jamie J. Morgan's cover produced by Richard Mazda reached #27\, whilst Beat System got to #63. In 1985\, 79-year old veteran German actress Gerty Molzen recorded her own version of the song\, cleaning up some of the lyrics in the process. She performed it on the David Letterman show in the US and on Gay Byrne's Late Late Show in Ireland. Echo & the Bunnymen usually merge this in concert with Nothing Lasts Forever. A 2005 song by artist RX featured George W. Bush "singing" a mixture of John Lennon's "Imagine" and the chorus from "Walk on the Wild Side". Irish/Australian comedian Jimeoin covered the song in 1993 on his music/comedy CD\, Goin' Off. The song featured the line "You should have seen them go go go\, I said G-O-G-G-O\, take a walk on the wildside" as a reference to the popular Yellow Pages ad on TV at the time. The Strokes and Robbie Williams played the full song or a snippet during their last tours. The band Sponge have been known to break into the song in the middle of playing their hit "Have You Seen Mary?" in live performances. The Rentals also play it live before transitioning into their hit "Friends of P". Train sings this song for the Bay Area's local station KFOG\, on a CD called Live From The Archives: Vol. 11\, as a part of the KFOG Kaboom Medley. A short part of the song was often used by Bono during performances of Bad in the mid eighties. Most notably performed at Live Aid in London. At a charity event\, Lou Reed played this song with comedians Conan O'Brien\, Jimmy Fallon\, Adam Sandler\, and Jack Black. Each person took on one verse of the song. Vanessa Paradis covered the song in her album Variations sur le même t'aime. Jesse Malin covered it on On Your Sleeve\, a cover album released in 2008. Young@Heart\, an entertainment group created by and for the elderly\, composed of people at least 70 years of age\, perform this song in concert. Moby includes the song in his concerts. During Exit Festival 2009\, he referred to it as "his favourite song about New York." Editors covered this song on 2007. Cover can be found on album Rhythms del Mundo Classics. Australian band Yves Klein Blue covered the song on the radio segment 'Like a Version' on Triple J in 2010 Trumpeter Rick Braun covered the song from 2005 album "Yours Truly." The German group Tok Tok Tok covers this song in their album "I wish" in 2005. The French group Pink Turtle gives this song a Jazz Age twist in their album "Reprise! When jazz meets pop #3" (2007).  Media Appearances  In a scene from the film Hedwig and the Angry Inch Hedwig starts singing it while in an oven. This song is usually the opening to Danny Masterson's LA radio show\, "Feel My Heat". Natalie Portman sings the line "And the colored girls go Doo\, doo\, doo\, doo\, doo\, doo\, doo\, doo" in the film Beautiful Girls. In the television show Medium\, the episode "Lady Killer" featured the tune of "Walk on the Wild side" (with no lyrics) during Patricia Arquette's character's dreams about a woman seducing men\, and perhaps gave a clue to who the actual killer was. The bassline of this song is used in the Gatorade G2 commercial. In the movie Guess Who this song is playing on the radio while Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher are driving in the car. In the film The Salton Sea an old man with a tracheotomy sings the song on a karaoke machine in a bar. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

A budge label or drugstore label as they were sometimes called.  This is another 25 cent record I found at the flea market\, that had to be thoroughly cleaned.  At least the album cover didn't fall apart on this one like the other one\, but it had no labels  when I removed it from the album.  I found them in like new condition inside the album\, maybe they were so budgeted you had to affix your own labels\, which I'll do with some 3M adhesive.

Márcio Greyck apresentou um programa chamado "O Mundo é dos Jovens"\, na extinta TV Tupi de São Paulo\, ao lado da cantora Sandra\, em 1967. Nessa época\, Roberto Carlos apresentava o programa "Jovem Guarda" na TV Record\, exibido de 1965 a 1968. Revista ROLLING STONE\, Outubro de 2008\, pag 158 : "No ano em que o mundo comemora as 40 primaveras do White Album\, lançado em 1968\, o Brasil acaba de dar à luz uma versão também democrática do disco duplo dos Beatles. No original\, pela primeira vez\, Paul\, John e George abriram espaço para Ringo colocar uma música sua no repertório\, e\, como instrumentistas\, cada um teve a chance de se mostrar individualmente. No Álbum Branco produzido pelo jornalista e pesquisador Marcelo Fróes\, os 30 convidados imprimiram seu estilo às músicas. Zé Ramalho canta "Dear Prudence" na velha conhecida "atmosfera mística"\, enquanto Daniel Tendler\, com timbre grave e vocal cuidadoso\, transforma "The Continuing Story Of Bungalow Bill" em canção para ninar gente grande. Pato Fu fez "Birthday" com cara de... Pato Fu. "I Will"\, com Érika Martins\, virou um delicioso folk\, enquanto "Julia" fez as vezes de bossa nova na voz e no violão de Celso Fonseca. Grande surpresa é a versão de Márcio Greyck para "Martha My Dear": com voz dobrada\, o músico faz bela interpretação da canção de Lennon e McCartney." (..)

Travis Edmonson had previously been a member of the Gateway Singers. They released ten albums and toured widely before splitting in 1965\, becoming significant musicians on the folk revival circuit. Edmonson and Dashiell reportedly had frequent clashes\, and the duo separated from 1960-63. During this period Dashiell put out several records with The Kinsmen\, and Edmonson put out several solo albums. Dashiell went solo after their final breakup in 1965\, putting out a solo album in 1968. He taught late in life\, and died in 1989 as a result of a brain tumor. Edmonson toured regularly in the 1970s as a solo act. He died on May 9\, 2009.  iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/es/album/bud-and-travis-1959/id833528283  Síguenos en: Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/vintagem.es Spotify: http://open.spotify.com/user/vintagemusic Web: http://www.vintagemusic.es BoutiqAlia: http://boutiqalia.com/store/vintage/ (compra física de CD) Compra nuestros Cd's en formato físico en estas plataformas: Ebay:  http://stores.ebay.com/VintageMusicFm BoutiqAlia: www.boutiqalia-vintagemusic.com Síguenos en: Spotify: https://goo.gl/raouHQ Facebook: https://goo.gl/L92BHL Instagram: https://goo.gl/3oYDGH Web: http://www.vintagemusic.es   Compra nuestros Cd's en formato físico en estas plataformas: Ebay:  http://stores.ebay.com/VintageMusicFm BoutiqAlia: www.boutiqalia-vintagemusic.com Discogs: https://www.discogs.com/es/seller/vintagemusicfm/profile COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm	0

COL title VAL Ebb Tide COL performer VAL The Randy Van Horne Singers	COL video title VAL MOONYK and JEFFERY SMITH COL description VAL MOONYK ilustradora surrealista de Vietnam. Poco se sabe de esta excelente artista... JEFFERY SMITH. Excelente barítono!. Canción "Eleanor Rigby". Album: A little Sweeter. En el verano de 1995\, se firmó un contrato con la Universal para tres álbumes\, por los que recibió una excelente crítica internacional. Por sus interpretaciones de "A Drum Is A Woman" en París y por co-protagonizar\, junto a Dee Dee Bridgewater\, Cabaret y Peace & Love\, Jeffery Smith fue venerado como uno de los mejores vocalistas de jazz masculino\, en la industria de hoy. En EE.UU. el debut de Jeffery llegó en 1998 con su auto-producido A Little Sweeter\, que contó con la brillantez del piano del genio Kenny Barron y su trío\, con Ray Drummond en el bajo y Ben Riley a la batería\, que ganó la aclamación de los críticos; la revista Times lo describió como "Uno de los álbumes más importantes del año". En 1999 continuó su exitosa carrera con su también auto-producida tercera grabación\, titulada Down Here Below\, destacándose en él la diva del jazz Dianne Reeves\, y el virtuoso violín de Regina Carter\, y que recibió elogios igualmente magníficos de revistas tales como Jazz Times\, Jazziz\, Down Beat y Vanity Fair COL channel name VAL gorrion1977	0

Recurring themes in Adkins' work include love\, heartbreak\, police\, death\, decapitation\, hot dogs\, aliens\, and chicken. Adkins often noted in interviews that his primary heroes and influences were Hank Williams Sr.\, Jimmie Rodgers\, Little Richard\, and Col. Harlan Sanders\, the inventor of Kentucky Fried Chicken.

Rumour has it that The Squires were ousted out of their position as Tom's band when Jones was offered his lucrative TV show in the States\,seems thay wanted Tom and not the Boys in the band. To placate them\, Manager Gordon Mills offered them the chance of stardom with this cover.Joe South went on to score the big trans atlantic hit and Freddy Weller(of Paul Revere and The Raiders) took his pedal steel laden version to the top of the Country Charts later that year.

COL title VAL Hallelujah COL performer VAL Stephen Lloyd-Morgan	COL video title VAL Wilson Pickett - Hey Jude (w/ Duane Allman) COL description VAL Before there was The Allman Brothers Band\, Duane Allman was trying to attract any kind of attention and make a name for himself. The music business is hard you know. Though immortalized now as one of the greatest guitarist of all time\, it was Gregg who was more sought out in the record business in the early days. So Duane made ends meet by being a session guitarist in studios while he decided what his next move would be.  It was in November of 1968\, when Wilson Pickett - already a star - showed up at Rick Halls Fame Studio in Muscle Shoals\, AL wanting to record\, but with no material or ideas. Duane\, who was working for Rick but was not even the main\, lead session guitarist\, suggested that they cut "Hey Jude"\, which Rick thought was "the most preposterous thing" he had ever heard and Wilson agreed they would NOT do it. The Beatles had just recently released it and it was climbing the charts. But Duane somehow convinced them both it was a good idea because it "was" a Beatles song and it "would" be Number 1. And\, as you hear\, it was a GREAT idea. This song sparked the beginning of Duane's future nickname and the formation of ABB.  The story goes that Duane was already known as "Dog" because of his looks. As you might imagine\, the hippie look that Duane sported was few and far between in late 1960's Alabama. When Wilson heard the way Duane played he started calling him "Sky Man". Not just for his "out of this world" playing but also for his "out of this world" state of mind he liked being in (recreational activities for those who still don't get it). From there the name somewhere morphed into "Skydog". Rick Hall was also so amazed that he phoned Jerry Wexler and put the phone up to the speakers on the playback so he could hear the song. Needless to say\, he was also blown away by Duane's playing. And in Wilson's defense of this DA story\, his vocals in this song are what they are in all his songs -- AWESOME.  Jerry Wexler was Wilson's main producer for Atlantic who wasn't able to be there and gave the reins to Hall. Wexler\, along with Phil Walden\, later in '69\, started Capricorn Records in Macon\, GA and we all know that story. Also\, Phil Walden is also the man who introduced and brought in Jaimoe to play with Duane. They started jamming together before any of the other Brothers joined in.  Well anyway - this is for your listening pleasure and hope you enjoy it. If you want to know more of this story\, I highly recommend pp. 80-88 of "Skydog: The Duane Allman Story" by Randy Poe. It is where this info came from and it is the best book ever if you are a Duane and/or ABB fan. And the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section...thank you...you helped change the world and the music for the better. COL channel name VAL MrElDuderino85	0

Although all of these seven natural wonders are still in existence today\, and are still being adored by many tourists across the globe\, the New7Wonders Foundation launched a campaign in 2007 to select a new list of natural wonders.

The Following is CNN list of seven breathtaking wonders of the world created by nature itself\, in random order:  1. Magical dancing lights\, performing through the night! -- AURORA BOREALIS (Alaska) 2. A thousand tiny islands in one mountain cupped bay\, no way! -- HARBOR OF RIO DE JANEIRO (Brazil) 3. A canyon so vast\, and carved out of the past! -- GRAND CANYON (USA) 4. A giant coral reef\, with fish beyond belief! -- GREAT BARRIER REEF (Australia) 5.  A mountain so high it almost reaches the sky! -- MOUNT EVEREST (Himalayas) 6.  A volcano that grew\, nearly right in front of you! -- PARICUTIN VOLCANO (Mexico) 7.  Falls so tall\, a dinosaur would feel small! - VICTORIA FALLS (South Africa)       ~Planetpals~ ---------------------------------------------------- DADDY'S LOVE (an acrostic poem)  Daddy's love\, so beautiful Aurora\, you're colorful\, but not as wonderful Daddy's love\, can never be detached Deep Grand Canyon\, you're so vast\, but not a match  Yesterdays\, today and into tomorrows Surpassing all sorrow 'though times are borrowed Love of Daddy\, so solid\, like Mount Kilimanjaro Only his love is indestructible and so magical Victoria Falls\, you're fantastic\, but you don't have his magic  Endless love and wind beneath my wings\, that's my Daddy!  ~I love you\, Daddy! Happy Father's Day - From WhiteLibraTexas~ ----------------------------------------------------------  I picked the featured song\, "Wind Beneath My Wings\," to dedicate to the coolest father on earth\, my Daddy\, and to all the wonderful fathers across the globe\, too.

She developed an interest in jazz from an early age\, through her father's collection of 78rpm records\, becoming "obsessed" with big band singers like Ella Fitzgerald and big bands like Joe Loss.  "I Only Have Eyes for You" is a popular romantic love song by composer Harry Warren and lyricist Al Dubin\, written in 1934. The song is a jazz standard\, and has been covered by thousands of musicians. -Lyrics - Are the stars out tonight? I don't know if it's cloudy or bright 'Cause I only have eyes for you\, dear The moon may be high But I can't see a thing in the sky 'Cause I only have eyes for you. I don't know if we're in a garden Or on a crowded avenue You are here\, so am I Maybe millions of people go by But they all disappear from view And I only have eyes for you I don't know if we're in a garden Or on a crowded avenue You are here\, so am I Maybe millions of people go by But they all disappear from view And I only have eyes for you.  - Song and images belong to their respective owners - COL channel name VAL Dreamer8girl	0

COL title VAL The Windmills of Your Mind (Theme from the Thomas Crown Affair) COL performer VAL Daniel Boaventura	COL video title VAL Ned Miller - From A Jack To A King 1963 Philips -- 318 882 PF.wmv COL description VAL enry Ned Miller (born April 12\, 1925\, Rains\, Carbon County\, Utah)[2] is an American country music artist. Active as a recording artist from 1956 to 1970\, he is known primarily for his hit single\, "From a Jack to a King"\, a crossover hit in 1962 which reached Top 10 on the country music\, adult contemporary\, and Billboard Hot 100 charts. He had several more chart singles in his career\, though none matched the peak of "From a Jack to a King". He composed and recorded "Invisible Tears\," which was later recorded by Connie Smith\, Bobby Bare\, and the Ray Conniff Singers.Biography  Miller's start as a songwriter came when he was sixteen years old.[2] He later joined the United States Marine Corps\, from which he was later discharged. In 1956\, both Gale Storm and Bonnie Guitar had Top Five hits with different versions of the song "Dark Moon"\, which Miller co-wrote.[2] Another song he wrote "A Falling Star"\, was a country hit for Jimmy C. Newman. Very notable is also his uptempo song "Cave In"\, which in 1960 was the flip side of Warren Smiths\, #5 country hit "I Don't Believe I'll Fall In Love Today" recorded for the Liberty records label. He also wrote and recorded a song called "From a Jack to a King"\, which was released on Fabor Records but saw little success on the charts.[3] After being briefly signed to Capitol Records\, Miller returned to Fabor and persuaded them to re-release "From a Jack to a King". The song proved successful the second time around\, and became a crossover hit for Miller.[2] It sold over two million copies by July 1963\, and was awarded a gold disc.[4]  Miller was not particularly interested in his singing career\, and rarely toured owing to stage fright.[3] He gave up recording in the 1970s and soon moved to Prescott\, Arizona\, and later to Las Vegas\, Nevada.[3]  Country music artist Ricky Van Shelton covered "From a Jack to a King" in the 1980s; his version reached Number One on the country music chart.[2] [edit] Discography [edit] Albums Year  Album  Chart Positions  Label U.S. Country  U.S. 1963  From a Jack to a King   50  Fabor 1965  Ned Miller Sings the Songs of Ned Miller    Capitol The Best of Ned Miller  28   1967  Teardrop Lane  22   1968  In the Name of Love    1970  Ned Miller's Back    Republic 1981  From a Jack to a King    Plantation [edit] Singles Year  Single  U.S. Country  U.S.  U.S. AC  UK[5]  IRE  Album 1957  "Roll O' Rollin' Stone"  —  —  —  —  —  singles only "From a Jack to a King"  —  —  —  —  — "Lights in the Street"  —  —  —  —  — 1958  "Gypsy"  —  —  —  —  — 1959  "Ring the Bell for Johnny"  —  —  —  —  — 1961  "Cold Gray Bars"  —  —  —  —  — "Dark Moon"  —  —  —  —  — 1962  "From a Jack to a King" (re-release)  2  6  3  2  1  From a Jack to a King 1963  "One Among the Many"  27  —  —  —  — "Another Fool Like Me"  28  —  —  —  —  singles only "Big Love"  —  —  —  —  — 1964  "Invisible Tears"  13  131  —  —  —  The Best 1965  "Do What You Do Do Well"  7  52  —  48  — "Two Voices\, Two Shadows\, Two Faces"  —  —  —  —  —  Songs of Ned Miller "Whistle Walkin'"  28  —  —  —  — "Down the Street"  —  —  —  —  — 1966  "Lovin' Pains"  —  —  —  —  —  The Best "Summer Roses"  39  —  —  —  —  Teardrop Lane "Teardrop Lane"  44  —  —  —  — 1967  "Echo of the Pines"  —  —  —  —  —  singles only "Hobo"  53  —  —  —  — 1968  "Only a Fool"  61  —  —  —  —  In the Name of Love 1969  "Autumn Winds"  —  —  —  —  —  singles only 1970  "Breakin'"  —  —  —  —  — "Lover's Song"  39  —  —  —  —  Ned Miller's Back "Back to Oklahoma"  —  —  —  —  — COL channel name VAL Amnondoowop	0

FILM DESCRIPTION: Expanding on their Saturday Night Live characters\, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd star as Jake and Elwood Blues\, two white boys with black soul. Sporting cool shades and look-alike suits\, Jake and Elwood are dispatched on a "mission from God" by their former teacher\, Sister Mary Stigmata (Kathleen Freeman). Said mission is to raise $5000 to save an orphanage. In the course of their zany adventures\, the Blues Brothers run afoul of neo-Nazi Henry Gibson\, perform the theme from Rawhide before the most unruly bar crowd in written history\, and lay waste to hundreds of cars on the streets and freeways of Chicago. In case you aren't swept up in the infectuous nuttiness of the brothers Blue\, you might have fun spotting film's legion of guest stars\, including James Brown\, Cab Calloway\, Aretha Franklin\, Ray Charles\, John Candy\, Carrie Fisher\, Steve Lawrence\, Twiggy\, Paul Reubens (aka Pee-Wee Herman)\, Frank Oz\, and Steven Spielberg.

COL title VAL Magic Moments COL performer VAL Hi-Fi Bros	COL video title VAL Paul Mauriat: ♫ L'Amour est bleu (Love is Blue) ♫ COL description VAL Sucesso de Paul Mauriat e sua orquestra em 1968\, "L'Amour est bleu" ("Love is Blue")  é uma composição de Pierre Cour e André Popp\, que a gravou originalmente em 1967. A canção foi enorme sucesso não só na França\, mas também em vários países do mundo\, e recebeu inúmeras gravações\, como as de Caravelli\, Claudine Longet\, Clementine\, Gabor Szabo\, Jeff Beck\, Los Indios Trabajaras\, Michel Fugain\, Michele Torr\, Ray Conniff\, Richard Clayderman\, Sandpipers\, Santo and Johnny\, The Dells\, Vicky Leandros e outros. No Brasil foram registrações versões\, intituladas "O amor é azul"\,  de Clara Nunes\, Celly Campello\, Luiz Loy e seu Conjunto e The Jordans. A gravação de Paul Mauriat é o principal hit da carreira deste orquestrador francês nascido em 4 de março de 1925 em Marselha.  O talento de Paul Mauriat é hereditário. Era filho de uma família de músicos\, tendo seu pai como primeiro mestre. Aos quatro anos\, iniciou seus estudos de piano. Aos dez\, entra para o Conservatório de Paris\, saindo quatro anos mais tarde decidido a seguir a carreira de concertista. O encontro com o jazz\, entretanto\, muda os planos iniciais do artista. O novo ritmo decididamente influencia o estilo que o tornaria famoso em todo o mundo.  Mauriat cresceu em Paris e aos dezessete anos\, organiza sua própria orquestra\, apresentando-se em cabarés e teatros na França e em outros países da Europa. Na década de 50\, tornou-se o arranjador preferido de vários cantores franceses\, entre os quais se destaca a figura de Charles Aznavour. Fã da Música Popular Brasileira\, Mauriat gravou clássicos como Casa no campo (Zé Rodrix - Tavito)\, Amada amante (Roberto Carlos - Erasmo Carlos)\, Presepada (Antonio Carlos - Jocafi)\, Naquela mesa (Sergio Bittencourt)\, Viagem (J.de Aquino - Paulo César Pinheiro) e outros.  Ele se retirou da profissão em 1998\, num último show em Osaka\, Japão. Mas a orquestra ainda faz shows pelo mundo\, e inclusive fez duas viagens para a China. Em 2002 o escritor e perito na vida do maestro\, Serge Elhaik lançou uma biografia autorizada escrita em francês\, que se chama "Une vie en Bleu". Esta biografia contém valiosas informações sobre a discografia de Mauriat e muitas fotos dele e de sua orquestra. Nos últimos meses de vida\, o maestro ficou residindo em sua casa de verão na cidade de Perpignan. Foi internado no hospital da cidade\, muito fraco e\, após 2 dias internado\, a 1 da manhã do dia 3 de Novembro (horário local) de 2006\, Paul Mauriat faleceu aos 81 anos.

COL title VAL Sisters of Mercy COL performer VAL Sting & The Chieftains	COL video title VAL Lillian Roth -- Let's Fall in Love COL description VAL Lillian Roth (13 de diciembre de 1910 — 12 de mayo de 1980) fue una actriz y cantante estadounidense.  Nacida en Boston\, Massachusetts\, tenía únicamente seis años de edad cuando su madre la llevó a Educational Pictures\, donde pasó a ser la imagen de la compañía\, simbolizada por una estatua viviente sosteniendo la lámpara del conocimiento. Al año siguiente debutó como actriz teatral en el circuito de Broadway actuando en The Inner Man. Su primera actuación cinematográfica llegó en 1918 con Pershing's Crusaders. Junto a su hermana Ann actuaban de manera itinerante bajo el nombre de "Lillian Roth and Co\," y a veces las dos eran llamadas "The Roth Kids". Uno de los momentos más emocionantes de ambas hermanas llegó cuando conocieron al Presidente de los Estados Unidos Woodrow Wilson\, cuando éste llevó a las dos a dar la vuelta a la manzana en su coche tras asistir al número de vodevil de ambas. Roth entró en la Clark School of Concentration en los inicios de la década de 1920\, actuó en Artists and Models en 1923 y trabajó en Revels con Frank Fay.  En 1927\, cuando Roth tenía 17 años de edad\, trabajó en la primera de tres Earl Carroll Vanities\, a las cuales pronto siguieron las Midnight Frolics\, una producción de Florenz Ziegfeld. Pronto la joven actriz firmó un contrato de siete años con Paramount Pictures. Entre los filmes que rodó para Paramount figuran El desfile del amor (1929\, con Maurice Chevalier)\, The Vagabond King (1930)\, Paramount on Parade (1930)\, Honey (1930\, en el cual cantaba "Sing\, You Sinners")\, Madam Satan (1930\, de Cecil B. DeMille\, con Reginald Denny y Kay Johnson\, Sea Legs (con Jack Oakie)\, y la segunda película de los Hermanos Marx\, El conflicto de los Marx (1930). Roth hizo para el cine el papel que Ethel Merman había interpretado en la obra teatral Take a Chance\, y cantó "Eadie Was a Lady". Tras dejar Paramount hizo un papel de reparto en el film carcelario femenino Ladies They Talk About (Warner Brothers\, 1933)\, junto a Barbara Stanwyck.  Además\, fue cabeza de cartel del Teatro Palace de Nueva York\, actuando en Earl Carroll Vanities en 1928\, 1931 y 1932\, haciendo grandes progresos en su faceta de cantante. Desafortunadamente\, la vida personal de Roth cada vez se veía más ensombrecida por su adicción al alcohol. Roth estuvo fuera del candelero desde finales de la década de 1930 hasta 1953\, cuando actuó en un episodio especial de la serie televisiva This Is Your Life\, con Ralph Edwards. En respuesta a su sinceridad al relatar su historia de alcoholismo\, Roth recibió más de cuarenta mil cartas. En 1962 encarnó a la madre de Elliott Gould en el musical I Can Get It for You Wholesale\, producción en la cual hacía su debut en Broadway Barbra Streisand. A pesar de la gran acogida conseguida por Streisand\, el productor David Merrick observó que el nombre de Roth todavía vendía entradas\, por lo que tras el estreno puso su nombre por encima del de Gould\, Streisand y Sheree North. Roth permaneció en el show durante todas las representaciones\, un total de 301\, y grabó un disco relativo a la obra para Columbia Records.  Roth se casó al menos cinco veces. Sus maridos fueron el aviador William C. Scott ("Willie Richards")\, el juez Benjamin Shalleck\, Eugene J. Weiner ("Mark Harris")\, Edward Goldman ("Vic")\, y Burt McGuire. Antes de su primera boda había tenido una relación con David Lyons\, fallecido de tuberculosis. En mayo de 1932 se divorció de W. C. Scott\, tras trece meses de matrimonio. En 1955 conoció a Thomas Burt McGuire\, ligado a la editora Funk and Wagnalls Publishing Company\, en una reunión de Alcohólicos Anónimos\, grupo en el cual Roth formaba parte desde 1946. .  Roth falleció a causa de un ictus en 1980 en Nueva York. Tenía 69 años de edad. Fue enterrada en el Cementerio Mount Pleasant del Condado de Westchester\, Nueva York.

Lyrics: Hello\, darkness\, my old friend I've come to talk with you again Because a vision softly creeping Left its seeds while I was sleeping  And the vision that was planted in my brain Still remains Within the sound of silence  In restless dreams I walked alone Narrow streets of cobblestone 'Neath the halo of a street lamp I turned my collar to the cold and damp  When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light That split the night And touched the sound of silence  And in the naked light I saw Ten thousand people\, maybe more People talking without speaking People hearing without listening  People writing songs that voices never share And no one dare Disturb the sound of silence  "Fools\," said I\, ""You do not know Silence\, like a cancer\, grows Hear my words that I might teach you Take my arms that I might reach you""  But my words like silent raindrops fell And echoed in the wells of silence  And the people bowed and prayed To the neon god they made And the sign flashed out its warning In the words that it was forming  And the sign said "The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls And tenement halls And whispered in the sound Of silence"  #OfficialMusicVideo #Disturbed #SoundOfSilence #WeAreWarnerRecords COL channel name VAL Disturbed	0

COL title VAL Hey\, That's No Way to Say Goodbye COL performer VAL The Decemberists	COL video title VAL Bobby Scott  "Nature Boy"      (1990) COL description VAL In 1941\, a 33 year old George McGrew arrived in Los Angeles and began playing piano in the Eutropheon\, a small health food store and raw food restaurant on Laurel Canyon Boulevard. The cafe was owned by John and Vera Richter\, German immigrants who followed a Naturmensch and Lebensreform philosophy influenced by the Wandervogel movement in Germany.Their followers\, known as "Nature Boys"\, wore long hair and beards and ate only raw fruits and vegetables. McGrew adopted the philosophy and chose the name "eden ahbez"\, writing and spelling his name with lower-case letters. It was there while living in a cave near Palm Springs\, ahbez wrote "Nature Boy". Partly autobiographical\, the song was a tribute to his mentor Bill Pester\, who had originally introduced him to Naturmensch and Lebensreform.  In 1947\, at the prompting of Cowboy Jack Patton and Johnny Mercer\, ahbez approached Nat King Cole's manager backstage at the Lincoln Theater in Los Angeles\, handed him a tattered copy of "Nature Boy"\, and asked him to show it to Cole. However his pleas were ignored and a disappointed ahbez left the sheet music of "Nature Boy" with Cole's valet\, Otis Pollard. From him Cole came to know of the song and after reading it\, the singer loved it and began playing "Nature Boy" for live audiences to much acclaim. Irving Berlin\, who was present in the crowd\, had initially offered to buy the track from Cole. But he decided to record the track for himself and needed to get permission from ahbez before releasing it as a single. After ahbez was discovered living under the Hollywood Sign\, Cole got his permission and recorded the song COL channel name VAL nyronut	0

The song was originally recorded by Dionne Warwick.  Charting versions  "Walk On By" has charted numerous times in various countries\, with wildly different arrangements. The following entries discuss the chart versions of the song\, in the order in which they appeared:  Dionne Warwick version  The original version of "Walk On By" was recorded at the same December 1963 session that yielded "Anyone Who Had a Heart"\, which\, in 1964\, became Warwick's second Top Ten hit. Released in April of that year\, "Walk on By" reached #6 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and #1 on the Cashbox's R&B chart. (Billboard did not print rhythm and blues charts during 1964\, the year of the song's peak performance.) The song also reached the top 10 in a brief run on Billboard's easy listening survey.  Warwick also recorded a German version of the song\, entitled "Geh Vorbei".  Isaac Hayes version  Funk/soul musician Isaac Hayes released a cover version in 1969 on his album Hot Buttered Soul and transformed the song into a twelve-and-a-half minute funk vamp. Edited for single release down to under 5 minutes\, this single reached #30 on the U.S. charts.  The Stranglers version  In 1978\, The Stranglers recorded a gritty punk-inspired version (with an extended organ solo) that hit #21 on the UK charts.  D-Train version  In 1982\, funk duo D-Train recorded a UK and U.S. R&B/dance hit with the song in a boogie/funk cover.  Jo Jo Zep version  In 1983\, Australian act Jo Jo Zep covered the song in a slow\, moody version that featured electronics and synthesizers. The track was a minor hit in Australia\, peaking at #55\, but was a major hit in New Zealand\, hitting #6.  Sybil version  In 1990\, singer Sybil\, who had scored her biggest hit a year prior with a cover of Warwick's "Don't Make Me Over\," also scored a U.S. and UK hit with "Walk On By."  Gabrielle version  In 1997\, UK singer Gabrielle released her version of "Walk on By" as the fifth and final single from her album\, Gabrielle. It reached #7 in the UK.  Cyndi Lauper version  "Walk on By" was the first single from Cyndi Lauper's 2003 covers album\, At Last. It was also included on Lauper's 2004 DVD Live at Last. It was released as a promo only. Remixes of the song reached #10 on the U.S. dance chart.  Seal version  Seal released a version of "Walk On By" as a single in January 2005. Though the song did not chart in his native UK\, it made the lower reaches of the charts in several European countries\, including #57 in Austria\, #49 in Germany\, and #46 in Switzerland.  Other versions  Alan Price Alicia Keys recorded a hip hop version of the song on 2003 mutli-platinum album The Diary of Alicia Keys Aretha Franklin Average White Band The Beach Boys covered the song in a studio outtake for their 1969 album\, 20/20.

The song was originally recorded by Dionne Warwick.  Charting versions  "Walk On By" has charted numerous times in various countries\, with wildly different arrangements. The following entries discuss the chart versions of the song\, in the order in which they appeared:  Dionne Warwick version  The original version of "Walk On By" was recorded at the same December 1963 session that yielded "Anyone Who Had a Heart"\, which\, in 1964\, became Warwick's second Top Ten hit. Released in April of that year\, "Walk on By" reached #6 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and #1 on the Cashbox's R&B chart. (Billboard did not print rhythm and blues charts during 1964\, the year of the song's peak performance.) The song also reached the top 10 in a brief run on Billboard's easy listening survey.  Warwick also recorded a German version of the song\, entitled "Geh Vorbei".  Isaac Hayes version  Funk/soul musician Isaac Hayes released a cover version in 1969 on his album Hot Buttered Soul and transformed the song into a twelve-and-a-half minute funk vamp. Edited for single release down to under 5 minutes\, this single reached #30 on the U.S. charts.  The Stranglers version  In 1978\, The Stranglers recorded a gritty punk-inspired version (with an extended organ solo) that hit #21 on the UK charts.  D-Train version  In 1982\, funk duo D-Train recorded a UK and U.S. R&B/dance hit with the song in a boogie/funk cover.  Jo Jo Zep version  In 1983\, Australian act Jo Jo Zep covered the song in a slow\, moody version that featured electronics and synthesizers. The track was a minor hit in Australia\, peaking at #55\, but was a major hit in New Zealand\, hitting #6.  Sybil version  In 1990\, singer Sybil\, who had scored her biggest hit a year prior with a cover of Warwick's "Don't Make Me Over\," also scored a U.S. and UK hit with "Walk On By."  Gabrielle version  In 1997\, UK singer Gabrielle released her version of "Walk on By" as the fifth and final single from her album\, Gabrielle. It reached #7 in the UK.  Cyndi Lauper version  "Walk on By" was the first single from Cyndi Lauper's 2003 covers album\, At Last. It was also included on Lauper's 2004 DVD Live at Last. It was released as a promo only. Remixes of the song reached #10 on the U.S. dance chart.  Seal version  Seal released a version of "Walk On By" as a single in January 2005. Though the song did not chart in his native UK\, it made the lower reaches of the charts in several European countries\, including #57 in Austria\, #49 in Germany\, and #46 in Switzerland.  Other versions  Alan Price Alicia Keys recorded a hip hop version of the song on 2003 mutli-platinum album The Diary of Alicia Keys Aretha Franklin Average White Band The Beach Boys covered the song in a studio outtake for their 1969 album\, 20/20.

COL title VAL Joy to the World COL performer VAL The O.C. Supertones	COL video title VAL Hazy Osterwald - Cheek To Cheek (VintageMusic.es) COL description VAL Hazy Osterwald (* 18. Februar 1922 als Rolf Erich Osterwalder in Bern; † 26. Februar2012 in Luzern) war ein Schweizer Musiker\, Sänger und Orchesterleiter. Zu seinen bekanntesten Stücken gehören der «Kriminal-Tango» und der «Konjunktur-Cha-Cha» («Geh'n Sie mit der Konjunktur»). Osterwald\, der Sohn des Fussballnationalspielers und Buchhalters Adolf Osterwalder\, der ebenfalls den Spitznamen Hazy trug\, begeisterte sich als Schüler eher für Fussball und wurde wegen mangelnden Übens vom Klavierunterricht ausgeschlossen. Mitschüler drängten ihn aber dazu\, Pianist im Schulorchester zu werden. 1939 wurde er dessen Leiter. Ab 1940 besuchte er das Konservatorium und lernte bei Albert Moeschinger Komposition und Theorie\, daneben übte er Trompete. 1940\, ein Jahr vor seiner Matura\, arrangierte er für den Orchesterleiter Teddy Stauffer und andere. 1941 spielte er Trompete in der Band von Fred Böhler\, ab 1942 unter dem Künstlernamen «Hazy Osterwald». Bei den «Original Teddies» des Saxophonisten Eddie Brunner\, dem Nachfolger Stauffers\, spielte er 1944 Klavier und Trompete\, gründete aber im gleichen Jahr eine eigene achtköpfige Combo mit der Sängerin Kitty Ramon. Am 1. September 1944 kam das erste Engagement im Dancing Chikito in Bern. Die Erweiterung zur Bigband erwies sich als zu teuer\, und so gründete er nach dem Vorbild von Svend Asmussen am 1. Mai 1949 sein Sextett\, mit dem er noch im selben Jahr auf dem Festival International 1949 de Jazz in Paris spielte\, wo auch Grössen wie Charlie Parker und Sidney Bechet auftraten.

Uschi Brüning	COL video title VAL Songdog - Desolation Row COL description VAL http://www.ondarock.it/speciali/dylanbirthdayeng.htm  They're selling postcards of the hanging They're painting the passports brown The beauty parlor is filled with sailors The circus is in town Here comes the blind commissioner They've got him in a trance One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker The other is in his pants And the riot squad they're restless They need somewhere to go As Lady and I look out tonight From Desolation Row  Cinderella\, she seems so easy "It takes one to know one\," she smiles And puts her hands in her back pockets Bette Davis style And in comes Romeo\, he's moaning "You Belong to Me I Believe" And someone says\, "You're in the wrong place my friend You better leave" And the only sound that's left After the ambulances go Is Cinderella sweeping up On Desolation Row  Now the moon is almost hidden The stars are beginning to hide The fortune-telling lady Has even taken all her things inside All except for Cain and Abel And the hunchback of Notre Dame Everybody is making love Or else expecting rain And the Good Samaritan\, he's dressing He's getting ready for the show He's going to the carnival tonight On Desolation Row  Now Ophelia\, she's 'neath the window For her I feel so afraid On her twenty-second birthday She already is an old maid To her\, death is quite romantic She wears an iron vest Her profession's her religion Her sin is her lifelessness And though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow She spends her time peeking Into Desolation Row  Einstein\, disguised as Robin Hood With his memories in a trunk Passed this way an hour ago With his friend\, a jealous monk He looked so immaculately frightful As he bummed a cigarette Then he went off sniffing drainpipes And reciting the alphabet Now you would not think to look at him But he was famous long ago For playing the electric violin On Desolation Row  Dr. Filth\, he keeps his world Inside of a leather cup But all his sexless patients They're trying to blow it up Now his nurse\, some local loser She's in charge of the cyanide hole And she also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul" They all play on pennywhistles You can hear them blow If you lean your head out far enough From Desolation Row  Across the street they've nailed the curtains They're getting ready for the feast The Phantom of the Opera A perfect image of a priest They're spoonfeeding Casanova To get him to feel more assured Then they'll kill him with self-confidence After poisoning him with words And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls "Get Outa Here If You Don't Know Casanova is just being punished for going To Desolation Row"  Now at midnight all the agents And the superhuman crew Come out and round up everyone That knows more than they do Then they bring them to the factory Where the heart-attack machine Is strapped across their shoulders And then the kerosene Is brought down from the castles By insurance men who go Check to see that nobody is escaping To Desolation Row  Praise be to Nero's Neptune The Titanic sails at dawn And everybody's shouting "Which Side Are You On?" And Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot Fighting in the captain's tower While calypso singers laugh at them And fishermen hold flowers Between the windows of the sea Where lovely mermaids flow And nobody has to think too much About Desolation Row  Yes\, I received your letter yesterday (About the time the doorknob broke) When you asked how I was doing Was that some kind of joke? All these people that you mention Yes\, I know them\, they're quite lame I had to rearrange their faces And give them all another name Right now I can't read too good Don't send me no more letters\, no Not unless you mail them From Desolation Row COL channel name VAL jokerman02	0

COL title VAL The Greenland Fishery COL performer VAL Paul Clayton	COL video title VAL The Charlie Daniels Band - Sharp Dressed Man.wmv COL description VAL Tailgate Party This CD contains some of the greatest rock songs of all time. Originally made legendary by some of the south's best rock bands\, Charlie adds his own unique sound to each song. Originals\, live and studio versions make this collection live up to its' name by being a great one to pull out during a "Tailgate Party."   Description      13 Tracks previously released in 1999     Engineered\, Produced and Mixed by: Ron W. Griffin     Executive Producer: David Corlew  Guide Review - Charlie Daniels Band - Tailgate Party  Included on this very southern rock flavored collection are live versions of "The Legend of Wooley Swamp" and "The Devil Went Down to Georgia." With both songs being so well known and played a gazillion times\, it was refreshing to hear them live and just slightly different from what we are normally accustomed to.  "The South's Gonna Do It Again" had an added bonus to it by having a very early on in his career performance by Keith Urban\, showing us some very impressive guitar solo's. Remakes of ZZ Top's "Sharp Dressed Man" and Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Freebird" were very captivating and showed off some incredible fiddle playing by Charlie. Probably one of my most favorites was CDB's remake of the song made famous by Hootie and the Blowfish\, "Let Her Cry." Charlie has always been well known for his playing but under rated for his vocals. This song shows off just how well he can deliver some very heartfelt emotions and I really enjoyed listening to this new version.  If you have ever appreciated CDB\, you will really like this release. If for nothing else\, the diversity of the genre's and CDB being able to add the country sound without destroying the memory of the song.

COL title VAL Christmas Time Is Here COL performer VAL Daniela Andrade	COL video title VAL ABBEY LINCOLN little Niles (1958) COL description VAL Album : it's magic Tune written by Jon Hendricks / Randy Weston  Because Abbey Lincoln has always been careful to sing songs that have a deep meaning for her\, all of her recordings through the years are memorable in their own way; there are no duds in her discography. Her second Riverside session (and her third recording)\, It's Magic has been reissued on this CD in the Original Jazz Classics series. The backup musicians are among the best in jazz at the time (Kenny Dorham or Art Farmer on trumpet\, trombonist Curtis Fuller\, Benny Golson on tenor\, Jerome Richardson or Sahib Shihab on reeds\, pianist Wynton Kelly\, Paul Chambers or Sam Jones on bass\, and drummer Philly Joe Jones) and they have opportunities to play short solos. Lincoln is heard at her early best on such numbers as "I Am in Love\," "An Occasional Man\," "Out of the Past" and Randy Weston's "Little Niles." Recommended. COL channel name VAL OubaelPhoumet	0

COL title VAL Spring Is Here COL performer VAL Peter Nero	COL video title VAL Shirley Bassey - Johnny One Note (1976 Show #1) COL description VAL 1976 (Shirley performs this classic Rodgers & Hart Big Band Style Number 'Johnny One Note' with her own uniquely powerful style\, which is from the Musical 'Babes In Arms\,'  Shirley performed this song on her 1976 TV Variety Show.  Shirley recorded and released this song on her 1966 LP titled\, 'Shirley Bassey - I've Got A Song For You'.  ABOUT Johnny One Note: "Johnny One Note" is a 1937 show tune from the 1937 Rodgers and Hart musical Babes in Arms\, where it was introduced by Wynn Murrary. Judy Garland sang it in the film version\, released in 1939.  The musical contained more great songs Shirley Bassey has also performed: "The Lady Is A Tramp"\, "Where Or When" and "My Funny Valentine".  The 'Babes In Arms' story is about a group of vaudevillians who want to revive their old fashioned form of entertainement by doing a roadshow. "Johnny One Note" is sung as a bedtimestory. A kind of fairy tale about a very ego-centred singer who is so very loud that nobody can hear the soprano. This lady singer asks her godmother to put a spell on Johnny\, so that the next time he wants to impress everybody by holding his note as long as possible he has to held it forever.  Shirley Bassey wrote about "Johnny One Note":   I don't always recognize the right songs for me the first time I hear them. For a long time I was asked to do 'Johnny One Note'\, but I couldn't do it for many\, many years. Then one day Eddie Fisher's musical director just sat at the piano and said\, 'This is a good song for you'\, and started playing 'Johnny One Note'. The way he played it\, I got so excited\, but I said 'I can't do this song'. 'Why not?' he asked. 'Well\, when I was discovered\, the girl whose place I took in the show\, she had a big hit with this song and I've never been able to touch this song.' 'Well\, try it\,' he said. And I was amazed when I opened my mouth: this voice came out singing this song as though it was mine. So\, after all those years - it was about ten years\, I believe - when we actually got down to it\, it was a piece of cake.  LYRICS: Johnny could only sing one note  And the note he sang was this: aaaahh  Poor Johnny One Note  Sang out with Gusto A nd just overloaded the place Poor Johnny One Note  Yelled willy-nilly  Until he was blue in the face For holding one note was his ace  Couldn't hear the brass  Couldn't hear the drum He was in a class  By himself\, by gum Poor Johnny One Note  Got in Aida indeed a great chance to be brave He took his one note  Howled like the North Wind  Brought forth wind that made critics rave While Verdi turned round in his grave  Couldn't hear the flute  Or the big trombone Everyone was mute  Johnny stood alone Cats and dogs stopped yapping  Lions in the zoo  Were all jealous of Johnny's big thrill Thunderclaps stopped clapping  Traffic ceased its roar  And they tell us Niag'ra stood still He stopped the trainwistles  Boatwhistles  Steamwhistles  Copwhistles All whistles bowed to his skill  Sing Johnny One Note Sing out with gusto  And just overwhelm all the crowd  Aaaahh   So sing\, Johnny One Note out loud  Sing\, Johnny One Note  Sing -  Johnny -  One Note -  Out loud  ABOUT the LP\, I've Got A Song For You: I've Got a Song for You is a 1966 album by Shirley Bassey. Bassey had left EMI's Columbia Label\, and this was her first album for United Artists\, a label she would remain with for approximately 14 years. This album and the following release And We Were Lovers were produced by Bassey's former husband\, Kenneth Hume. (Their marriage had ended in divorce in 1965\, but he continued to act as her manager\, and for these two albums\, her producer.) The album entered the UK Albums Chart at #26\, but only remained on the chart for one week\, and failed to chart in the US\, despite her having received outstanding reviews for live engagements in New York and Las Vegas that same year\, and the fact that the album was recorded in New York.

COL title VAL Blues My Naughty Sweetie Gives to Me COL performer VAL Jimmy McPartland	COL video title VAL Lillian Roth -- Let's Fall in Love COL description VAL Lillian Roth (13 de diciembre de 1910 — 12 de mayo de 1980) fue una actriz y cantante estadounidense.  Nacida en Boston\, Massachusetts\, tenía únicamente seis años de edad cuando su madre la llevó a Educational Pictures\, donde pasó a ser la imagen de la compañía\, simbolizada por una estatua viviente sosteniendo la lámpara del conocimiento. Al año siguiente debutó como actriz teatral en el circuito de Broadway actuando en The Inner Man. Su primera actuación cinematográfica llegó en 1918 con Pershing's Crusaders. Junto a su hermana Ann actuaban de manera itinerante bajo el nombre de "Lillian Roth and Co\," y a veces las dos eran llamadas "The Roth Kids". Uno de los momentos más emocionantes de ambas hermanas llegó cuando conocieron al Presidente de los Estados Unidos Woodrow Wilson\, cuando éste llevó a las dos a dar la vuelta a la manzana en su coche tras asistir al número de vodevil de ambas. Roth entró en la Clark School of Concentration en los inicios de la década de 1920\, actuó en Artists and Models en 1923 y trabajó en Revels con Frank Fay.  En 1927\, cuando Roth tenía 17 años de edad\, trabajó en la primera de tres Earl Carroll Vanities\, a las cuales pronto siguieron las Midnight Frolics\, una producción de Florenz Ziegfeld. Pronto la joven actriz firmó un contrato de siete años con Paramount Pictures. Entre los filmes que rodó para Paramount figuran El desfile del amor (1929\, con Maurice Chevalier)\, The Vagabond King (1930)\, Paramount on Parade (1930)\, Honey (1930\, en el cual cantaba "Sing\, You Sinners")\, Madam Satan (1930\, de Cecil B. DeMille\, con Reginald Denny y Kay Johnson\, Sea Legs (con Jack Oakie)\, y la segunda película de los Hermanos Marx\, El conflicto de los Marx (1930). Roth hizo para el cine el papel que Ethel Merman había interpretado en la obra teatral Take a Chance\, y cantó "Eadie Was a Lady". Tras dejar Paramount hizo un papel de reparto en el film carcelario femenino Ladies They Talk About (Warner Brothers\, 1933)\, junto a Barbara Stanwyck.  Además\, fue cabeza de cartel del Teatro Palace de Nueva York\, actuando en Earl Carroll Vanities en 1928\, 1931 y 1932\, haciendo grandes progresos en su faceta de cantante. Desafortunadamente\, la vida personal de Roth cada vez se veía más ensombrecida por su adicción al alcohol. Roth estuvo fuera del candelero desde finales de la década de 1930 hasta 1953\, cuando actuó en un episodio especial de la serie televisiva This Is Your Life\, con Ralph Edwards. En respuesta a su sinceridad al relatar su historia de alcoholismo\, Roth recibió más de cuarenta mil cartas. En 1962 encarnó a la madre de Elliott Gould en el musical I Can Get It for You Wholesale\, producción en la cual hacía su debut en Broadway Barbra Streisand. A pesar de la gran acogida conseguida por Streisand\, el productor David Merrick observó que el nombre de Roth todavía vendía entradas\, por lo que tras el estreno puso su nombre por encima del de Gould\, Streisand y Sheree North. Roth permaneció en el show durante todas las representaciones\, un total de 301\, y grabó un disco relativo a la obra para Columbia Records.  Roth se casó al menos cinco veces. Sus maridos fueron el aviador William C. Scott ("Willie Richards")\, el juez Benjamin Shalleck\, Eugene J. Weiner ("Mark Harris")\, Edward Goldman ("Vic")\, y Burt McGuire. Antes de su primera boda había tenido una relación con David Lyons\, fallecido de tuberculosis. En mayo de 1932 se divorció de W. C. Scott\, tras trece meses de matrimonio. En 1955 conoció a Thomas Burt McGuire\, ligado a la editora Funk and Wagnalls Publishing Company\, en una reunión de Alcohólicos Anónimos\, grupo en el cual Roth formaba parte desde 1946. .  Roth falleció a causa de un ictus en 1980 en Nueva York. Tenía 69 años de edad. Fue enterrada en el Cementerio Mount Pleasant del Condado de Westchester\, Nueva York.

This recording provided a return to the Top 20 for the Four Preps\, and would be their last Top 40 hit. Around this time\, the Four Preps became very popular touring on college campuses and released a series of campus albums. The songs and groups parodied here are The Fleetwoods (Mr. Blue)\, the Hollywood Argyles (Alley Oop)\, the Platters (Smoke gets in Your Eyes)\, the Four Freshmen (In This Whole Wide World)\, the Kingston Trio (A Worried Man\, Tom Dooley) and Dion and the Belmonts (A Teenager in Love). The Barron Knights\, a British group\, used this idea of satirizing popular groups for their own records in the UK.  B-side is "Swing Down Chariot". COL channel name VAL TheLimePopsicle	0

The band was originally formed in 1963 by guitarist Steve Fataar\, bassist Brother Fataar (real name Edries Fataar)\, drummer George Faber and guitarist Eugene Champion. However\, this line-up would only be together to record a couple of songs. Ricky Fataar replaced George Faber as the band's drummer around 1964 and Edries Fredericks replaced Eugene Champion as the guitarist. Baby Duval briefly replaced Edries Fredericks in 1967. Blondie Chaplin then replaced Baby Duval in 1967. This was to be the line-up from 1967 until their demise as a group in 1970. In 1972 Ricky Fataar and Blondie Chaplin joined The Beach Boys.  This song is off the album "Soulfire!!" released in 1968. It's a cover of a Stevie Wonder song from 1966. COL channel name VAL keurspel (Leon Rossouw)	0

With Todd Duncan singing the vocals\, the song was nominated for an Oscar in 1955\, but the Best-Song award went to the hit song "Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing". It has become one of the most recorded songs of the 20th century\, by some counts having spawned over 500 versions in hundreds of different languages.  In 1955\, North used the music as a theme for the prison film Unchained\, hence the name. Todd Duncan sang the vocals for the film soundtrack. Les Baxter\, released an instrumental version which reached #2. Then song recordings were released by Al Hibbler reaching #3 on the Billboard charts\, Jimmy Young which hit #1 in the United Kingdom\, and Roy Hamilton reaching #1 on the R&B Best Sellers list and #6 on the pop chart. Hundreds of other recordings followed.  It was the July 1965 version by The Righteous Brothers that became a jukebox standard for the late 20th century\, regaining massive popularity when used in the 1990 blockbuster film Ghost. It will also be featured as a musical number in the upcoming GHOST The Musical.  Early versions  Todd Duncan sang the vocals for the film soundtrack. Les Baxter released an instrumental version which reached #2. Al Hibbler followed close behind with a vocal version that reached #3 on the Billboard charts. He was followed soon after by Jimmy Young\, whose version hit #1 on the British charts. Roy Hamilton's version reached number one on the R&B Best Sellers list and #6 on the pop chart. June Valli took it to #29. Gene Vincent and his Blue Caps recorded it for their second album in 1956. It is also probably the most unusual cover version\, as the bridge was omitted. Harry Belafonte sang it at the 1956 Academy Awards where it was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song of 1955. In 1963\, an uptempo\, doo-wop version hit the regional charts (eastern U.S.) by Vito & the Salutations\, eventually becoming part of the soundtrack for Goodfellas in 1990. Perry Como recorded the song in 1955\, and English jazz musician Cliff Townshend of The Squadronaires also released a popular version in 1956.  Other versions  One early cover was by teen idol Ricky Nelson\, whose version was issued in 1958 on the album Ricky Nelson.  Gisele Mackenzie covered the song on her 1958 solo album for RCA Victor\, Gisele (LPM/LSP-1790).  The Supremes covered the song for their album I Hear A Symphony\, released in 1966.  Roy Orbison recorded a version of it for his album Many Moods\, released in May 1969.  On June 21\, 1977\, just six weeks before his death\, Elvis Presley performed "Unchained Melody" for what would be his last television appearance\, "Elvis In Concert." However\, the recording that was ultimately released as a single and included on the Moody Blue album (the last released while he was alive) was from an earlier appearance at Ann Arbor\, Michigan\, featuring him on piano\, as was invariably the case when Presley sang the song in concert.  In 1981\, a live version of the band Heart peaked at #83 on the Billboard Top 100.  In 1986\, Leo Sayer released a version of the song with a contemporary re-working of the "wall of sound".  U2 also covered the song as a B-side to their 1989 single\, "All I Want Is You".  In 1995\, the song was performed by Robson Green and Jerome Flynn in the UK drama series Soldier Soldier.  Sarah McLachlan  Cyndi Lauper was nominated for a 2005 Grammy award for "Best Instrumental Composition Accompanying a Vocal" for her interpretation of the song\, which appears on the At Last album. In 2006\, singer Barry Manilow covered the song on his album Greatest Songs of the Fifties. The Smashing Pumpkins also released a cover of the song in their Live Smashing Pumpkins album series.  Deerhunter frontman Bradford Cox recorded a version in 2007 as Atlas Sound and gave it away on his blog.  Johnny Maestro & The Brooklyn Bridge performed the song in concert as a tribute to Bobby Hatfield\, and it appeared on their 2008 "Greatest Hits Live" CD.  Gareth Gates recorded a cover version of the song as his first release following his appearance on Pop Idol in the United Kingdom. The single reached number one in the UK Singles Chart on its first week of release.  Clay Aiken recorded the song on his 2010 album Tried and True.  The Pop Opera group\, Amici Forever recorded the song in Italian\, under the title\, 'Senza Catene'.  Joni Mitchell incorporated the chorus and parts of the melody in 'Chinese Cafe/Unchained Melody'.  Constantine Maroulis during a guest performance on American Idol on April 7\, 2011.

Lyrics:  Through early morning fog I see  Visions of the things to be  The pains that are withheld for me  I realize and I can see  That suicide is painless  It brings on many changes  And I can take or leave it if I please   The game of life is hard to play  I'm going to lose it anyway  The losing card I'll someday lay  So this is all I have to say   Suicide is painless  It brings on many changes  And I can take or leave it if I please   The sword of time will pierce our skins  It doesn't hurt when it begins  But as it works it's way on in  The pain grow stronger watch it grin   Suicide is painless  It brings on many changes  And I can take or leave it if I please   A brave man once requested me  To answer questions that are key  Is it to be or not to be  And I replied "Oh why ask me."   Suicide is painless  It brings on many changes  And I can take or leave it if I please   And you can do the same thing if you please. COL channel name VAL leendot	0

COL title VAL Masters of War COL performer VAL Ed Sheeran	COL video title VAL Tommy Dorsey -  "Oh Look At Me Now"  -  vocals - Frank Sinatra\,Connie Haines\, & The Pied Pipers COL description VAL "Oh! Look at Me Now" is a 1941 song composed by Joe Bushkin\, with lyrics by John DeVries. It is strongly associated with Frank Sinatra\, who first recorded it with Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra\, in an arrangement by Sy Oliver. Sinatra re-recorded the song in 1957 for the album A Swingin' Affair\, this time conducted by Nelson Riddle.  Frank Sinatra - with Tommy Dorsey\, Connie Haines and The Pied Pipers\, January 6\, 1941\, A Swingin' Affair! (1957)\, Sinatra 57 in Concert (1999)  Connie Haines died in September 2008 Obit... September 26\, 2008  Connie Haines\, a petite and dynamic big band singer who performed alongside Frank Sinatra in the Harry James and Tommy Dorsey orchestras\, died Monday in Clearwater\, Fla. The cause of death was myasthenia gravis\, an autoimmune neuromuscular disease. She was 87.  Haines was best known as a singer with a knack for rhythm\, and many of her most successful recordings -- 25 of which each sold more than 50\,000 copies -- featured her crisp\, swinging vocal style.   When Dorsey first heard her in action with James at Frank Dailey's Meadowbrook\, New Jersey's temple of big band music\, he reportedly asked\, "Hey\, little girl\, where'd you learn to swing like that? And when can you join my band?"  It didn't take long. Haines recorded "Comes Love" and "I Can't Afford to Dream" with James\, revealing a capacity to handle lyrical ballads as well as jitterbug specials\, before moving to the Dorsey organization with Sinatra.  James\, however\, was not fond of Haines' birth name -- Yvonne Marie Antoinette JaMais -- suggesting that it would take up too much space on a theater marquee. "You don't look like an Yvonne\," he said\, "you look like a Connie." And "Haines" was chosen\, apparently because it was a close rhyme to "James."  Haines quickly made the name her own\, however\, establishing herself as one of the prime female singers of the big band era. Many of her hit songs were the product of a warm musical partnership with Sinatra via tunes such as "Oh\, Look At Me Now\," "Let's Get Away From It All\," "Friendship\," "I'll Never Smile Again" and the jaunty rhythm tune "Snooty Little Cutie."  Like many big band vocalists of the '40s\, Haines moved on to a solo career as the public's preferences turned away from large ensemble swing to singers. Over the course of the next few decades\, she released more than 200 recordings\, ranging from her big band stylings to more contemporary rhythms.  The first white singer to record for Motown Records\, she released 14 songs written by Smokey Robinson\, including "What's Easy For Two Is Hard For One."  Haines also was drawn to gospel music as a reflection of her Christian beliefs\, recording and touring in an ensemble that included close friends Beryl Davis\, Rhonda Fleming and Jane Russell.  Although her career as an actress tended to be framed in films that allowed her to perform as a singer\, Haines' appearances in motion pictures such as "The Duchess of Idaho" suggested a talent that never had the opportunity to fully blossom within her lifelong dedication to music.  She was a regular on the Abbott & Costello Radio Show and a frequent guest artist during the golden years of television variety shows\, appearing with Milton Berle\, Eddie Cantor\, Perry Como\, Frankie Laine and Ed Sullivan\, among others.  Haines' marriage to Robert DeHaven\, an ace pilot during World War II\, ended in divorce.  She is survived by her mother\, Mildred JaMais\, who is 109; a son\, Robert DeHaven Jr. of San Francisco; a daughter\, Kimberly Harlan of Prineville\, Ore.; and three grandchildren."

COL title VAL Instant Karma COL performer VAL Pas de Deux	COL video title VAL Someone To Watch Over Me By Enoch Light COL description VAL Enoch Light was a classical violinist\, bandleader\, and recording engineer who was a pioneer of early stereo excellence.  He would go to extreme lengths to create high-quality recordings that took full advantage of current state of the art equipment.  He pioneered stereo effects that bounced the sounds between the right and left channels (often described as "ping-pong").  He arranged his musicians in ways to produce the kinds of recorded sounds he wished to achieve\, the first to do so.   His ensemble of studio musicians was frequently referred to as The Light Brigade.  The first of the his albums\, Persuasive Percussion\, became the first huge hit based solely on record sales.  His songs received little or no airplay on the radio\, because AM radio\, the standard of the day\, was monaural.  He released several albums in the Persuasive Percussion series\, as well as a Command test record.  He doubled the size of his album sleeves but enabled it to fold like a book\, thus inventing the gatefold-packaging format.   The gatefold sleeve became extremely popular in later decades\, and was used on albums such as The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  He pioneered many recording techniques such as the use of 35 mm film soundtrack instead of magnetic tape.  Recording on 35 mm film soundtrack reduced the effects of "wow" and "flutter"\, common in early stereo recordings.   The recordings were released under the "35MM" series\, starting from "Stereo 35-MM" released by Command Records.   Musicians who appeared on his albums include Doc Severinsen\, Tony Mottola\, Dick Hyman\, and arranger Lew Davies.    In 1965\, he sold the Command record label to ABC\, who began using the label for their lesser quality releases.  He continued recording after the sale of Command with a new label called Project 3\, but did not concentrate so heavily on stereo effects.  Enoch Light And The Light Brigade\, using the original scores\, released albums of the hits of the big band era\, keeping the arrangements as close to the original as possible.

COL title VAL Non cercarmi COL performer VAL Ricky Gianco	COL video title VAL Kris Kristofferson - For the good times (1970) COL description VAL Fair use - no copyright violation intended  "For the good times" from Kris' debut album "Kristofferson". It's so sad and beautiful at the same time...  Great lyrics as always\, and this beautiful tune ... I love it!  Of course this song was not written about Rita and him\, but things always happen twice in one's lifetime...  It was Kris'  first No 1 country hit as a writer in 1970 It was "Song of the Year" (and "Single Record of the Year") of the Academy of Country Music in 1970 - (That was the first time a writer had won "Song of the Year" awards from both the Country Music Association  - with "Sunday Mornin' comin' down"- AND the Academy of Country Music for different songs in the same year)  In 1971 Ray Price won a Grammy Award for "Best Male Country Vocal Performance" with it.  The scenes are from the movies "The last honor of Kathryn Beck"- aka "Act of Passion" (1984) and "Blood and Orchids" (TV\, 1986). Both movies are great to me and worth watching anyway\, but only available on VHS tapes. ... The latter one is available on DVD now http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0035QHNVU  Kris already began to write the song in 1968\, in his Opel\, on one of his endless rides from Nashville to the Gulf.   "I began a song about making love to a woman for the last time. After a while the melody really got to me. I couldn't wait to get to a guitar. I was riding along thinking about that part where it says\, 'Hear the whisper of the raindrops blowin' soft against the window\,' and I wondered if I could play it. I wrote only the first part of the lyrics then. A while went before I finished it\, I can't remember how long.... But I do remember who I wrote it about." Probably it was inspired by the dying days of his relationship to Fran...  Now it's hard to believe that for a time some radio stations wouldn't play the original recording by Bill Nash because of its "overtly sexual content"; indeed for a brief time\, Kris couldn't even find anyone who wanted to record the song... And then? A spokeman for Buckhorn Music\, which published the song shortly before Kris switched to Combine Music\, said later\, "It's recorded by pretty much everyone who comes into town to do an album\, Englebert Humperndinck\, Dean Martin\, Andy Williams\, Chet Atkins\, Loretta Lynn and many more."  For the good times  Don't look so sad\, I know it's over But life goes on and this old world will keep on turning Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together There's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning  Lay your head upon my pillow\, hold your warm and tender body close to mine Hear the whisper of the raindrops blowin' soft against the window And make believe you love me one more time For the good times   I'll get along\, you'll find another  And I'll be here if you should find  you ever need me Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever  There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me   Lay your head upon my pillow Hold your warm and tender body close to mine Hear the whisper of the raindrops Blowin' soft against my window Make believe you love me one more time For the good times   For the good times (1968)  Schau nicht so traurig\, ich weiß\, es ist vorbei. Aber das Leben geht weiter  und diese alte Welt wird sich weiterdrehen. Lass uns einfach froh sein\,  dass wir einige Zeit zusammen verbringen konnten Wir müssen uns nicht die Brücken anschauen\, die wir verbrennen.  Leg deinen Kopf auf mein Kissen\, halte deinen warmen und zärtlichen Körper  dicht an meinen Hör das Flüstern der Regentropfen  weich gegen das Fenster schlagen Und lass mich noch einmal glauben\, dass du mich liebst - wegen der guten Zeiten  Ich werd zurecht kommen\, du wirst einen anderen finden. Und ich werde hier sein falls du je entscheidest\, dass du mich brauchst. Sag kein Wort über das Morgen oder das Fürimmer. Es wird noch genug Zeit sein fürs Traurigsein wenn du mich verlässt...

Nessa época\, Roberto Carlos apresentava o programa "Jovem Guarda" na TV Record\, exibido de 1965 a 1968. Revista ROLLING STONE\, Outubro de 2008\, pag 158 : "No ano em que o mundo comemora as 40 primaveras do White Album\, lançado em 1968\, o Brasil acaba de dar à luz uma versão também democrática do disco duplo dos Beatles. No original\, pela primeira vez\, Paul\, John e George abriram espaço para Ringo colocar uma música sua no repertório\, e\, como instrumentistas\, cada um teve a chance de se mostrar individualmente. No Álbum Branco produzido pelo jornalista e pesquisador Marcelo Fróes\, os 30 convidados imprimiram seu estilo às músicas. Zé Ramalho canta "Dear Prudence" na velha conhecida "atmosfera mística"\, enquanto Daniel Tendler\, com timbre grave e vocal cuidadoso\, transforma "The Continuing Story Of Bungalow Bill" em canção para ninar gente grande. Pato Fu fez "Birthday" com cara de... Pato Fu. "I Will"\, com Érika Martins\, virou um delicioso folk\, enquanto "Julia" fez as vezes de bossa nova na voz e no violão de Celso Fonseca. Grande surpresa é a versão de Márcio Greyck para "Martha My Dear": com voz dobrada\, o músico faz bela interpretação da canção de Lennon e McCartney." (..)

It reached #2 on the UK Singles Chart and #7 on the United States Charts. Like their previous hit "You Really Got Me"\, the song relies on a simple sliding power chord riff\, although this song's riff is slightly more complicated\, incorporating a B Flat after the chords F and G. Otherwise\, the recordings are similar in beat and structure\, with similar background vocals\, progressions\, and guitar solos. In 2003 it appeared as #57 on Pure Pop's list of The 100 Best Singles of All. The guitar solo break by Dave Davies is truly inspired and difficult to copy\, and deemed to be so excellent that for many years it was claimed that Jimmy Page played the break - however\, it has been documented\, and confirmed by Ray Davies\, that Dave made up and played the solo himself\, accidentally augmenting the unique riff by playing it through an amp with a hole in it. Time.  Cover versions  The Stranglers made a cover in 1988\, reaching #7 in the UK singles charts. The Remains also did a cover of the song. It can be found on their album\, "A Session with The Remains". It was covered by Evermore on the single Light Surrounding You. Andy Timmons\, Paul Gilbert and Steve Vai covered it for the 90th Anniversary Ibanez concert. the Zodiacs (1965) Trooper (1979) Praying Mantis (1981) Skew Siskin (1992) Quiet Riot covered the song on their album "Down to the Bone" (1995) Cactus Jack (2002) Status Quo (17 November 2003) Flunk (2 May 2005) WaveGroup Sound (2007) Metallica covered the song at the Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame Anniversary Show with Ray Davies on vocals.

Use in pop culture  "All Day and All of the Night" was featured in television advertisements for Starburst candy in 1998 and 1999.  The Wavegroup Sound cover of "All Day and All of the Night" is featured in the video game Guitar Hero: Aerosmith.  "All Day and All of the Night" is played in the video game Battlefield Vietnam.  "All Day and All of the Night" is played during the opening and closing credits of The Boat That Rocked and is also used in a trailer for the film.

It's so sad and beautiful at the same time...  Great lyrics as always\, and this beautiful tune ... I love it!  Of course this song was not written about Rita and him\, but things always happen twice in one's lifetime...  It was Kris'  first No 1 country hit as a writer in 1970 It was "Song of the Year" (and "Single Record of the Year") of the Academy of Country Music in 1970 - (That was the first time a writer had won "Song of the Year" awards from both the Country Music Association  - with "Sunday Mornin' comin' down"- AND the Academy of Country Music for different songs in the same year)  In 1971 Ray Price won a Grammy Award for "Best Male Country Vocal Performance" with it.  The scenes are from the movies "The last honor of Kathryn Beck"- aka "Act of Passion" (1984) and "Blood and Orchids" (TV\, 1986). Both movies are great to me and worth watching anyway\, but only available on VHS tapes. ... The latter one is available on DVD now http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0035QHNVU  Kris already began to write the song in 1968\, in his Opel\, on one of his endless rides from Nashville to the Gulf.   "I began a song about making love to a woman for the last time. After a while the melody really got to me. I couldn't wait to get to a guitar. I was riding along thinking about that part where it says\, 'Hear the whisper of the raindrops blowin' soft against the window\,' and I wondered if I could play it. I wrote only the first part of the lyrics then. A while went before I finished it\, I can't remember how long.... But I do remember who I wrote it about." Probably it was inspired by the dying days of his relationship to Fran...  Now it's hard to believe that for a time some radio stations wouldn't play the original recording by Bill Nash because of its "overtly sexual content"; indeed for a brief time\, Kris couldn't even find anyone who wanted to record the song... And then? A spokeman for Buckhorn Music\, which published the song shortly before Kris switched to Combine Music\, said later\, "It's recorded by pretty much everyone who comes into town to do an album\, Englebert Humperndinck\, Dean Martin\, Andy Williams\, Chet Atkins\, Loretta Lynn and many more."  For the good times  Don't look so sad\, I know it's over But life goes on and this old world will keep on turning Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together There's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning  Lay your head upon my pillow\, hold your warm and tender body close to mine Hear the whisper of the raindrops blowin' soft against the window And make believe you love me one more time For the good times   I'll get along\, you'll find another  And I'll be here if you should find  you ever need me Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever  There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me   Lay your head upon my pillow Hold your warm and tender body close to mine Hear the whisper of the raindrops Blowin' soft against my window Make believe you love me one more time For the good times   For the good times (1968)  Schau nicht so traurig\, ich weiß\, es ist vorbei. Aber das Leben geht weiter  und diese alte Welt wird sich weiterdrehen. Lass uns einfach froh sein\,  dass wir einige Zeit zusammen verbringen konnten Wir müssen uns nicht die Brücken anschauen\, die wir verbrennen.  Leg deinen Kopf auf mein Kissen\, halte deinen warmen und zärtlichen Körper  dicht an meinen Hör das Flüstern der Regentropfen  weich gegen das Fenster schlagen Und lass mich noch einmal glauben\, dass du mich liebst - wegen der guten Zeiten  Ich werd zurecht kommen\, du wirst einen anderen finden. Und ich werde hier sein falls du je entscheidest\, dass du mich brauchst. Sag kein Wort über das Morgen oder das Fürimmer. Es wird noch genug Zeit sein fürs Traurigsein wenn du mich verlässt...

The first known published version of a "Frankie and Johnny" melody appeared in 1904 in the song "He Done Me Wrong (The Death Of Bill Bailey)"\, written by Hughie Cannon.  A variation on the melody\, with words and music by Frank and Bert Leighton\, appeared in 1908 under the title "Bill\, You Done Me Wrong". It was republished in 1912\, credited to the Leighton Brothers and Ren Shields\, as the more commonly recognizable "Frankie and Johnny".  The first known recording of Frankie and Johnny was in 1912\,  a vocal by Gene Greene accompanied by Charlie Straight on a very rare British Pathé 78 rpm disk.  The Leighton brothers recorded it for Victor in 1916 but it was never issued. Al Bernard made the first American recording for Brunswick in May of 1921\, followed a month later by this recording by Frank Crumit with the Biese Trio. In 1927\, Crumit recorded it again for Victor Records using different lyrics. COL channel name VAL bsgs98	0

COL title VAL Imagine COL performer VAL Jack Johnson	COL video title VAL Don Shirley -- Easy Living COL description VAL Don Shirley  Donald Walbridge Shirley (Pensacola\, 29 de enero de 1927-Manhattan\, 6 de abril de 2013)\, más conocido como Don Shirley\, fue un pianista y compositor de jazz estadounidense. Grabó muchos álbumes para la discográfica Cadence Records durante las décadas de 1950 y 1960\, en los que experimentaba con el jazz e influencias de la música clásica. Compuso sinfonías para órgano\, conciertos de piano y de chelo\, cuartetos de cuerda\, una ópera de un acto\, obras para órgano\, piano y violín\, un poema sinfónico basado en la novela Finnegans Wake de James Joyce\, y un grupo de «Variaciones» sobre la leyenda de Orfeo en en el inframundo. Durante los sesenta\, Shirley se embarcó en varias giras musicales\, algunas en los estados del Sur Profundo\, en las que contrató a Tony «Lip» Vallelonga\, portero de una discoteca de Nueva York\, como su chofer y guardaespaldas personal. La historia de ambos fue adaptada para el cine en la película de 2018 Green Book.  Primeros años Donald Walbridge Shirley nació el 29 de enero de 1927 en Pensacola\, Florida\, hijo de los inmigrantes jamaicanos Stella Gertrude (1903-1936)\, una maestra\, y Edwin S. Shirley (1885-1982)\, un sacerdote episcopal.​ En varios artículos se sostuvo que su lugar de nacimiento fue en Kingston\, pero esto es incorrecto porque algunos de sus promotores publicitaban falsamente que había nacido en Jamaica  Educación Shirley comenzó a tocar el piano cuando tenía dos años.​ A la edad de nueve\, fue invitado a estudiar teoría musical con Mittolovski en el Conservatorio Musical de Leningrado. También estudió con Conrad Bernier y Thaddeus Jones en la Universidad Católica de América en Washington D. C.. Después de abandonar el piano durante un tiempo\, Shirley obtuvo un doctorado en psicología.  Carrera En 1945\, a la edad de dieciocho\, Shirley tocó el Concierto para piano n.º 1 de Tchaikovsky con la Orquesta Boston Pops. Un año después\, tocó una de sus composiciones con la Orquesta Filarmónica de Londres. En 1949\, recibió la invitación del gobierno haitiano de tocar durante la Exposición General de segunda categoría de Puerto Príncipe y posteriormente el presidente Dumarsais Estimé y el arzobispo Le Goise le pidieron una nueva presentación para la siguiente semana.  Desanimado por la falta de oportunidades para músicos clásicos de piel negra\, Shirley abandonó el piano como carrera cuando era joven. Estudió psicología en la Universidad de Chicago y comenzó a trabajar como psicólogo en esa ciudad. Allí también regresó a la música y obtuvo una beca para estudiar la relación entre la música y el crimen juvenil\, que había aumentado durante la era de la posguerra a principios de 1950. Tocando en un pequeño club\, experimentó con el sonido para determinar las reacciones de la audiencia.  Durante las décadas de 1950 y 1960\, Shirley grabó muchos álbumes para Cadence Records\, en los que experimentaba mezclando el jazz con influencias de la música clásica. En 1961\, su sencillo «Water Boy» alcanzó la posición número 40 en la lista Billboard Hot 100 y se mantuvo en ella durante 14 semanas.6​ Dio presentaciones en la ciudad de Nueva York\, donde Duke Ellington le oyó tocar y luego iniciaron una relación de amistad.6​ A pedido de Arthur Fiedler\, Shirley se presentó junto a la Orquesta Boston Pops en junio de 1954. En 1955\, lo hizo junto a la Orquesta Sinfónica de la NBC en el estreno del concierto de piano de Ellington en Carnegie Hall. También apareció en el programa televisivo Arthur Godfrey and His Friends.  Durante los años sesenta\, Shirley dio varias giras musicales\, algunas en estados sureños\, creyendo que con sus actuaciones podría cambiar el parecer sobre los negros. Para su viaje\, contrató a un portero de una discoteca de Nueva York\, Tony «Lip» Vallelonga como su chofer y guardaespaldas. Su historia fue adaptada en la película de 2018 Green Book. De acuerdo al relato de la película\, a pesar de fricciones iniciales debido a sus personalidades diferentes\, los dos se volvieron buenos amigos. Sin embargo\, Maurice Sherley\, hermano de Don\, dijo que él «nunca consideró a Tony su "amigo"; era su empleado\, su chofer (quien resentía tener que usar una gorra y uniforme)».  Shirley falleció el 6 de abril de 2013 por complicaciones cardíacas\, a los 86 años de edad  Fuente: Wikipedia   Síguenos en: Spotify: https://goo.gl/raouHQ Facebook: https://goo.gl/L92BHL Instagram: https://goo.gl/3oYDGH Web: http://www.vintagemusic.es   Compra nuestros Cd's en formato físico en estas plataformas: Ebay:  http://stores.ebay.com/VintageMusicFm BoutiqAlia: www.boutiqalia-vintagemusic.com Discogs: https://www.discogs.com/es/seller/vintagemusicfm/profile COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm	0

COL title VAL Wind Beneath My Wings COL performer VAL Sam Harris	COL video title VAL Bobby Scott  "Nature Boy"      (1990) COL description VAL In 1941\, a 33 year old George McGrew arrived in Los Angeles and began playing piano in the Eutropheon\, a small health food store and raw food restaurant on Laurel Canyon Boulevard. The cafe was owned by John and Vera Richter\, German immigrants who followed a Naturmensch and Lebensreform philosophy influenced by the Wandervogel movement in Germany.Their followers\, known as "Nature Boys"\, wore long hair and beards and ate only raw fruits and vegetables. McGrew adopted the philosophy and chose the name "eden ahbez"\, writing and spelling his name with lower-case letters. It was there while living in a cave near Palm Springs\, ahbez wrote "Nature Boy". Partly autobiographical\, the song was a tribute to his mentor Bill Pester\, who had originally introduced him to Naturmensch and Lebensreform.  In 1947\, at the prompting of Cowboy Jack Patton and Johnny Mercer\, ahbez approached Nat King Cole's manager backstage at the Lincoln Theater in Los Angeles\, handed him a tattered copy of "Nature Boy"\, and asked him to show it to Cole. However his pleas were ignored and a disappointed ahbez left the sheet music of "Nature Boy" with Cole's valet\, Otis Pollard. From him Cole came to know of the song and after reading it\, the singer loved it and began playing "Nature Boy" for live audiences to much acclaim. Irving Berlin\, who was present in the crowd\, had initially offered to buy the track from Cole. But he decided to record the track for himself and needed to get permission from ahbez before releasing it as a single. After ahbez was discovered living under the Hollywood Sign\, Cole got his permission and recorded the song COL channel name VAL nyronut	0

Overseen by Chicago producers Charlie "Baby" Rosario and Manfred Mohr (whose 20 Fingers Productions would later score with the cheeky club hit "Short Dick Man")\, Max-A-Million's lone release was 1995's Take Your Time. The title track\, a cover of the S.O.S. Band's 1980 hit\, struck gold again in its updated form\, becoming a worldwide dancefloor sensation. Max-A-Million followed up the success of Take Your Time with a cover version of the Marvin Gaye classic "Sexual Healing." The original song's undeniable groove helped Max-A-Million's rather tepid rehash find legs\, and Take Your Time was well on its way to platinum status. COL channel name VAL UnidiscMusic	0

COL title VAL Voulez-vous COL performer VAL ABBA	COL video title VAL Don Shirley -- Easy Living COL description VAL Don Shirley  Donald Walbridge Shirley (Pensacola\, 29 de enero de 1927-Manhattan\, 6 de abril de 2013)\, más conocido como Don Shirley\, fue un pianista y compositor de jazz estadounidense. Grabó muchos álbumes para la discográfica Cadence Records durante las décadas de 1950 y 1960\, en los que experimentaba con el jazz e influencias de la música clásica. Compuso sinfonías para órgano\, conciertos de piano y de chelo\, cuartetos de cuerda\, una ópera de un acto\, obras para órgano\, piano y violín\, un poema sinfónico basado en la novela Finnegans Wake de James Joyce\, y un grupo de «Variaciones» sobre la leyenda de Orfeo en en el inframundo. Durante los sesenta\, Shirley se embarcó en varias giras musicales\, algunas en los estados del Sur Profundo\, en las que contrató a Tony «Lip» Vallelonga\, portero de una discoteca de Nueva York\, como su chofer y guardaespaldas personal. La historia de ambos fue adaptada para el cine en la película de 2018 Green Book.  Primeros años Donald Walbridge Shirley nació el 29 de enero de 1927 en Pensacola\, Florida\, hijo de los inmigrantes jamaicanos Stella Gertrude (1903-1936)\, una maestra\, y Edwin S. Shirley (1885-1982)\, un sacerdote episcopal.​ En varios artículos se sostuvo que su lugar de nacimiento fue en Kingston\, pero esto es incorrecto porque algunos de sus promotores publicitaban falsamente que había nacido en Jamaica  Educación Shirley comenzó a tocar el piano cuando tenía dos años.​ A la edad de nueve\, fue invitado a estudiar teoría musical con Mittolovski en el Conservatorio Musical de Leningrado. También estudió con Conrad Bernier y Thaddeus Jones en la Universidad Católica de América en Washington D. C.. Después de abandonar el piano durante un tiempo\, Shirley obtuvo un doctorado en psicología.  Carrera En 1945\, a la edad de dieciocho\, Shirley tocó el Concierto para piano n.º 1 de Tchaikovsky con la Orquesta Boston Pops. Un año después\, tocó una de sus composiciones con la Orquesta Filarmónica de Londres. En 1949\, recibió la invitación del gobierno haitiano de tocar durante la Exposición General de segunda categoría de Puerto Príncipe y posteriormente el presidente Dumarsais Estimé y el arzobispo Le Goise le pidieron una nueva presentación para la siguiente semana.  Desanimado por la falta de oportunidades para músicos clásicos de piel negra\, Shirley abandonó el piano como carrera cuando era joven. Estudió psicología en la Universidad de Chicago y comenzó a trabajar como psicólogo en esa ciudad. Allí también regresó a la música y obtuvo una beca para estudiar la relación entre la música y el crimen juvenil\, que había aumentado durante la era de la posguerra a principios de 1950. Tocando en un pequeño club\, experimentó con el sonido para determinar las reacciones de la audiencia.  Durante las décadas de 1950 y 1960\, Shirley grabó muchos álbumes para Cadence Records\, en los que experimentaba mezclando el jazz con influencias de la música clásica. En 1961\, su sencillo «Water Boy» alcanzó la posición número 40 en la lista Billboard Hot 100 y se mantuvo en ella durante 14 semanas.6​ Dio presentaciones en la ciudad de Nueva York\, donde Duke Ellington le oyó tocar y luego iniciaron una relación de amistad.6​ A pedido de Arthur Fiedler\, Shirley se presentó junto a la Orquesta Boston Pops en junio de 1954. En 1955\, lo hizo junto a la Orquesta Sinfónica de la NBC en el estreno del concierto de piano de Ellington en Carnegie Hall. También apareció en el programa televisivo Arthur Godfrey and His Friends.  Durante los años sesenta\, Shirley dio varias giras musicales\, algunas en estados sureños\, creyendo que con sus actuaciones podría cambiar el parecer sobre los negros. Para su viaje\, contrató a un portero de una discoteca de Nueva York\, Tony «Lip» Vallelonga como su chofer y guardaespaldas. Su historia fue adaptada en la película de 2018 Green Book. De acuerdo al relato de la película\, a pesar de fricciones iniciales debido a sus personalidades diferentes\, los dos se volvieron buenos amigos. Sin embargo\, Maurice Sherley\, hermano de Don\, dijo que él «nunca consideró a Tony su "amigo"; era su empleado\, su chofer (quien resentía tener que usar una gorra y uniforme)».  Shirley falleció el 6 de abril de 2013 por complicaciones cardíacas\, a los 86 años de edad  Fuente: Wikipedia   Síguenos en: Spotify: https://goo.gl/raouHQ Facebook: https://goo.gl/L92BHL Instagram: https://goo.gl/3oYDGH Web: http://www.vintagemusic.es   Compra nuestros Cd's en formato físico en estas plataformas: Ebay:  http://stores.ebay.com/VintageMusicFm BoutiqAlia: www.boutiqalia-vintagemusic.com Discogs: https://www.discogs.com/es/seller/vintagemusicfm/profile COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm	0

At least the album cover didn't fall apart on this one like the other one\, but it had no labels  when I removed it from the album.  I found them in like new condition inside the album\, maybe they were so budgeted you had to affix your own labels\, which I'll do with some 3M adhesive.

COL title VAL Hey Jude COL performer VAL José Feliciano	COL video title VAL Wilson Pickett - Hey Jude (w/ Duane Allman) COL description VAL Before there was The Allman Brothers Band\, Duane Allman was trying to attract any kind of attention and make a name for himself. The music business is hard you know. Though immortalized now as one of the greatest guitarist of all time\, it was Gregg who was more sought out in the record business in the early days. So Duane made ends meet by being a session guitarist in studios while he decided what his next move would be.  It was in November of 1968\, when Wilson Pickett - already a star - showed up at Rick Halls Fame Studio in Muscle Shoals\, AL wanting to record\, but with no material or ideas. Duane\, who was working for Rick but was not even the main\, lead session guitarist\, suggested that they cut "Hey Jude"\, which Rick thought was "the most preposterous thing" he had ever heard and Wilson agreed they would NOT do it. The Beatles had just recently released it and it was climbing the charts. But Duane somehow convinced them both it was a good idea because it "was" a Beatles song and it "would" be Number 1. And\, as you hear\, it was a GREAT idea. This song sparked the beginning of Duane's future nickname and the formation of ABB.  The story goes that Duane was already known as "Dog" because of his looks. As you might imagine\, the hippie look that Duane sported was few and far between in late 1960's Alabama. When Wilson heard the way Duane played he started calling him "Sky Man". Not just for his "out of this world" playing but also for his "out of this world" state of mind he liked being in (recreational activities for those who still don't get it). From there the name somewhere morphed into "Skydog". Rick Hall was also so amazed that he phoned Jerry Wexler and put the phone up to the speakers on the playback so he could hear the song. Needless to say\, he was also blown away by Duane's playing. And in Wilson's defense of this DA story\, his vocals in this song are what they are in all his songs -- AWESOME.  Jerry Wexler was Wilson's main producer for Atlantic who wasn't able to be there and gave the reins to Hall. Wexler\, along with Phil Walden\, later in '69\, started Capricorn Records in Macon\, GA and we all know that story. Also\, Phil Walden is also the man who introduced and brought in Jaimoe to play with Duane. They started jamming together before any of the other Brothers joined in.  Well anyway - this is for your listening pleasure and hope you enjoy it. If you want to know more of this story\, I highly recommend pp. 80-88 of "Skydog: The Duane Allman Story" by Randy Poe. It is where this info came from and it is the best book ever if you are a Duane and/or ABB fan. And the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section...thank you...you helped change the world and the music for the better. COL channel name VAL MrElDuderino85	1

The Phantom Four - Sanita  ------------------------  "A Forest" is a song by the English alternative rock band The Cure. Co-produced by Mike Hedges and Robert Smith\, it was released as a single from the band's second album Seventeen Seconds in April 1980. It was their debut entry on the United Kingdom chart\, where it reached number 31. The accompanying music video was first shown on BBC's Top of the Pops programme on 24 April 1980.  Background and recording  Mike Hedges co-produced the album Seventeen Seconds as well as "A Forest" with Robert Smith. Hedges had first worked with the band on the track "Killing an Arab".  Due to budgetary restraints\, Seventeen Seconds was recorded and mixed in seven days on a budget of between £2000 and £3000\, which resulted in the band working 16 or 17 hours a day to complete the album. "A Forest" was one of the last tracks recorded; the backing tracks were recorded first\, followed by touch-ups to the individual parts\, then Smith's vocals.  Re-recordings and cover versions  Since its release\, "A Forest" has become the most played Cure song\, with over 800 live appearances. A live version of "A Forest" appeared on a four-song edition of "The Hanging Garden" released in July 1982. It was performed with what has been described as a "rough\, punk-edged" sound on the 1984 live album Concert: The Cure Live. A performance appears on the live video The Cure in Orange\, highly regarded by Allmusic reviewer Ned Raggett.\, while other live versions of the song include the concert film Show\, and on disc one of the live album Bestival Live 2011.  In 1990\, the track was re-recorded and remixed by Mark Saunders for The Cure's Mixed Up album. The "Tree mix" version of "A Forest" was released as a single on 6 December 1990\, while the album had been released a few weeks before on 20 November. The song was redone for the second time on the Join the Dots box set\, this time remixed by Mark Plati and featuring Earl Slick on guitar. This version was described as "awful" and "instantly dated" by reviewer Chris Ott. An acoustic version was recorded and released on the bonus disc that came with some copies of the 2001 Greatest Hits CD.  Robert Smith supplied vocals for a Blank & Jones cover version of the song\, which appeared on their 2004 album Monument.  Waltari recorded a cover version released on their album So Fine!\, in 1994.  Nouvelle Vague covered A Forest in a bossa-nova style\, as part of its self-titled debut album in 2004.  Sophie Barker released a recording on her double A-side single "A Forest / Say Goodbye" which was released on 31 October 2011.  Ror-Shak\, a collaboration between DJ DB and Stakka\, covered the song on their only album Deep\, which was released in 2005. The music video was used in the TV Series Fringe in 2008.  English artist Bat for Lashes covered the song for the 2008 Cure tribute album Perfect as Cats: A Tribute to the Cure. Luke Lewis of NME praised the version\, noting it "teases out a crepuscular\, pagan atmosphere absent in the original".  Carpathian Forest recorded the song for their 1998 album Black Shining Leather.  Steven Wilson recorded a cover of the song for his solo release "Cover Version III" in 2005\, as part of his Cover Versions series. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

Em Angola\, também é conhecido porm'bolumbumba e é utilizado entre os quimbundos\, ovambos\, nyanekas\, humbise khoisan[2]. Este instrumento foi levado pelos escravos angolanos para o Brasil\, onde é utilizado para acompanhar uma dança/luta acrobática chamada capoeira[1]. No sul de Moçambique\, tem o nome de xitende. No Brasil\, também é conhecido por urucungo\, urucurgo\, orucungo\, oricungo\,uricungo\, rucungo\, ricungo\, berimbau metalizado\, gobo\, marimbau\,bucumbumba\, bucumbunga\, gunga\, macungo\, matungo\, mutungo\,aricongo\, arco musical e rucumbo. O instrumento é conhecido por ser tema de uma canção popular de Baden Powell de Aquino\, grande violonista brasileiro. A letra da música foi escrita por Vinícius de Moraes. Considerado um dos maiores percussionistas do planeta\, Naná Vasconcelos especializou-se em instrumentos brasileiros\, em especial o berimbau\, inclusive expandindo a sua técnica. Preservado na Bahia até o presente\, o berimbau sempre foi um souvenir típico do estado\, vendido aos turistas muito mais como adorno que como instrumento - colorido e enfeitado\, bem diferente daquele que os capoeiristas utilizam. Berimbau Vinicius de Moraes Quem é homem de bem Não trai! O amor que lhe quer Seu bem! Quem diz muito que vai Não vai! Assim como não vai Não vem!... Quem de dentro de si Não sai! Vai morrer sem amar Ninguém! O dinheiro de quem Não dá! É o trabalho de quem Não tem! Capoeira que é bom Não cai! E se um dia ele cai Cai bem!... Capoeira me mandou Dizer que já chegou Chegou para lutar Berimbau me confirmou Vai ter briga de amor Tristeza camará... Se não tivesse o amor (2x) Se não tivesse essa dor (2x) E se não tivesse o sofrer (2x) E se não tivesse o chorar (2x) Melhor era tudo se acabar (2x) Eu amei\, amei demais O que eu sofri por causa de amor ninguém sofreu Eu chorei\, perdi a paz Mas o que eu sei é que ninguém nunca teve mais... Mais do que eu Capoeira me mandou Dizer que já chegou Chegou para lutar Berimbau me confirmou Vai ter briga de amor Tristeza camará (Vídeo de Antônio Augusto dos Santos -- antaugsan -- Bocaiuva\, Divinópolis -- MG -- 1/10/2012) COL channel name VAL Antônio Bocaiúva	0

COL title VAL Hey Jude COL performer VAL Tom Jones	COL video title VAL Wilson Pickett - Hey Jude (w/ Duane Allman) COL description VAL Before there was The Allman Brothers Band\, Duane Allman was trying to attract any kind of attention and make a name for himself. The music business is hard you know. Though immortalized now as one of the greatest guitarist of all time\, it was Gregg who was more sought out in the record business in the early days. So Duane made ends meet by being a session guitarist in studios while he decided what his next move would be.  It was in November of 1968\, when Wilson Pickett - already a star - showed up at Rick Halls Fame Studio in Muscle Shoals\, AL wanting to record\, but with no material or ideas. Duane\, who was working for Rick but was not even the main\, lead session guitarist\, suggested that they cut "Hey Jude"\, which Rick thought was "the most preposterous thing" he had ever heard and Wilson agreed they would NOT do it. The Beatles had just recently released it and it was climbing the charts. But Duane somehow convinced them both it was a good idea because it "was" a Beatles song and it "would" be Number 1. And\, as you hear\, it was a GREAT idea. This song sparked the beginning of Duane's future nickname and the formation of ABB.  The story goes that Duane was already known as "Dog" because of his looks. As you might imagine\, the hippie look that Duane sported was few and far between in late 1960's Alabama. When Wilson heard the way Duane played he started calling him "Sky Man". Not just for his "out of this world" playing but also for his "out of this world" state of mind he liked being in (recreational activities for those who still don't get it). From there the name somewhere morphed into "Skydog". Rick Hall was also so amazed that he phoned Jerry Wexler and put the phone up to the speakers on the playback so he could hear the song. Needless to say\, he was also blown away by Duane's playing. And in Wilson's defense of this DA story\, his vocals in this song are what they are in all his songs -- AWESOME.  Jerry Wexler was Wilson's main producer for Atlantic who wasn't able to be there and gave the reins to Hall. Wexler\, along with Phil Walden\, later in '69\, started Capricorn Records in Macon\, GA and we all know that story. Also\, Phil Walden is also the man who introduced and brought in Jaimoe to play with Duane. They started jamming together before any of the other Brothers joined in.  Well anyway - this is for your listening pleasure and hope you enjoy it. If you want to know more of this story\, I highly recommend pp. 80-88 of "Skydog: The Duane Allman Story" by Randy Poe. It is where this info came from and it is the best book ever if you are a Duane and/or ABB fan. And the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section...thank you...you helped change the world and the music for the better. COL channel name VAL MrElDuderino85	1

COL title VAL Adios COL performer VAL Fausto Papetti	COL video title VAL George Barnes -- Adios COL description VAL George Barnes era uno de los guitarristas más prolíficos y versátiles de los años cincuenta y sesenta. Aunque\, básicamente era un hombre de jazz\, era un maestro de todos los estilos: blues\, country\, folk\, pop\, R & R\, R & B. Fue uno de los primeros en grabar con la guitarra eléctrica y Chet Atkins\, Les Paul y Charlie Christian le han citado como una fuente de inspiración principal.  A la edad de 14 años\, Barnes ya era un músico profesional y  había formado su propio cuarteto George Barnes. Dos años más tarde grabó sus primeros discos consu propio nombre: "I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles" and "I Can't Believe That You're In Love With Me" para el sello Okeh. En 1938 estaba trabajando para la NBC\, como director de orquesta\, guitarrista y arreglista. Tras su paso por el ejército durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial\, Barnes volvió a su trabajo de estudio y grabó transcripciones de radio con su octeto inusual.  En 1951 se trasladó de Chicago a Nueva York\, donde de inmediato consiguió un contrato con Decca para grabar sus propios álbumes. George también se reunió con Carl Kress en 1951\, el comienzo de una amistad que iba a dar lugar a una  formación aclamada por la crítica. Recorrieron el mundo juntos e hicieron algunas de las mejores grabaciones de dúos de guitarra de la historia.  En este tiempo\, George tenía  la Guild Guitar Company dedicada a construir una guitarra única bajo sus especificaciones. Tras la muerte de Kress en 1965\, la  próxima pareja de George iba a ser Bucky Pizzarelli. Como músico de estudio\, Barnes ha trabajado con todos\, desde Louis Armstrong a Bob Dylan.  iTunes: http://itunes.apple.com/es/album/guitar-galaxies/id476374761  Síguenos en: Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/vintagem.es Spotify: http://open.spotify.com/user/vintagemusic Web: http://www.vintagemusic.es BoutiqAlia: http://boutiqalia.com/store/vintage/ (compra física de CD) Compra nuestros Cd's en formato físico en estas plataformas: Ebay:  http://stores.ebay.com/VintageMusicFm BoutiqAlia: www.boutiqalia-vintagemusic.com Síguenos en: Spotify: https://goo.gl/raouHQ Facebook: https://goo.gl/L92BHL Instagram: https://goo.gl/3oYDGH Web: http://www.vintagemusic.es   Compra nuestros Cd's en formato físico en estas plataformas: Ebay:  http://stores.ebay.com/VintageMusicFm BoutiqAlia: www.boutiqalia-vintagemusic.com Discogs: https://www.discogs.com/es/seller/vintagemusicfm/profile COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm	1

COL title VAL Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas COL performer VAL Lionel Richie	COL video title VAL Tommy Dorsey -  "Oh Look At Me Now"  -  vocals - Frank Sinatra\,Connie Haines\, & The Pied Pipers COL description VAL "Oh! Look at Me Now" is a 1941 song composed by Joe Bushkin\, with lyrics by John DeVries. It is strongly associated with Frank Sinatra\, who first recorded it with Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra\, in an arrangement by Sy Oliver. Sinatra re-recorded the song in 1957 for the album A Swingin' Affair\, this time conducted by Nelson Riddle.  Frank Sinatra - with Tommy Dorsey\, Connie Haines and The Pied Pipers\, January 6\, 1941\, A Swingin' Affair! (1957)\, Sinatra 57 in Concert (1999)  Connie Haines died in September 2008 Obit... September 26\, 2008  Connie Haines\, a petite and dynamic big band singer who performed alongside Frank Sinatra in the Harry James and Tommy Dorsey orchestras\, died Monday in Clearwater\, Fla. The cause of death was myasthenia gravis\, an autoimmune neuromuscular disease. She was 87.  Haines was best known as a singer with a knack for rhythm\, and many of her most successful recordings -- 25 of which each sold more than 50\,000 copies -- featured her crisp\, swinging vocal style.   When Dorsey first heard her in action with James at Frank Dailey's Meadowbrook\, New Jersey's temple of big band music\, he reportedly asked\, "Hey\, little girl\, where'd you learn to swing like that? And when can you join my band?"  It didn't take long. Haines recorded "Comes Love" and "I Can't Afford to Dream" with James\, revealing a capacity to handle lyrical ballads as well as jitterbug specials\, before moving to the Dorsey organization with Sinatra.  James\, however\, was not fond of Haines' birth name -- Yvonne Marie Antoinette JaMais -- suggesting that it would take up too much space on a theater marquee. "You don't look like an Yvonne\," he said\, "you look like a Connie." And "Haines" was chosen\, apparently because it was a close rhyme to "James."  Haines quickly made the name her own\, however\, establishing herself as one of the prime female singers of the big band era. Many of her hit songs were the product of a warm musical partnership with Sinatra via tunes such as "Oh\, Look At Me Now\," "Let's Get Away From It All\," "Friendship\," "I'll Never Smile Again" and the jaunty rhythm tune "Snooty Little Cutie."  Like many big band vocalists of the '40s\, Haines moved on to a solo career as the public's preferences turned away from large ensemble swing to singers. Over the course of the next few decades\, she released more than 200 recordings\, ranging from her big band stylings to more contemporary rhythms.  The first white singer to record for Motown Records\, she released 14 songs written by Smokey Robinson\, including "What's Easy For Two Is Hard For One."  Haines also was drawn to gospel music as a reflection of her Christian beliefs\, recording and touring in an ensemble that included close friends Beryl Davis\, Rhonda Fleming and Jane Russell.  Although her career as an actress tended to be framed in films that allowed her to perform as a singer\, Haines' appearances in motion pictures such as "The Duchess of Idaho" suggested a talent that never had the opportunity to fully blossom within her lifelong dedication to music.  She was a regular on the Abbott & Costello Radio Show and a frequent guest artist during the golden years of television variety shows\, appearing with Milton Berle\, Eddie Cantor\, Perry Como\, Frankie Laine and Ed Sullivan\, among others.  Haines' marriage to Robert DeHaven\, an ace pilot during World War II\, ended in divorce.  She is survived by her mother\, Mildred JaMais\, who is 109; a son\, Robert DeHaven Jr. of San Francisco; a daughter\, Kimberly Harlan of Prineville\, Ore.; and three grandchildren."

COL title VAL Mood Indigo COL performer VAL Louis Armstrong	COL video title VAL Hazy Osterwald - Cheek To Cheek (VintageMusic.es) COL description VAL Hazy Osterwald (* 18. Februar 1922 als Rolf Erich Osterwalder in Bern; † 26. Februar2012 in Luzern) war ein Schweizer Musiker\, Sänger und Orchesterleiter. Zu seinen bekanntesten Stücken gehören der «Kriminal-Tango» und der «Konjunktur-Cha-Cha» («Geh'n Sie mit der Konjunktur»). Osterwald\, der Sohn des Fussballnationalspielers und Buchhalters Adolf Osterwalder\, der ebenfalls den Spitznamen Hazy trug\, begeisterte sich als Schüler eher für Fussball und wurde wegen mangelnden Übens vom Klavierunterricht ausgeschlossen. Mitschüler drängten ihn aber dazu\, Pianist im Schulorchester zu werden. 1939 wurde er dessen Leiter. Ab 1940 besuchte er das Konservatorium und lernte bei Albert Moeschinger Komposition und Theorie\, daneben übte er Trompete. 1940\, ein Jahr vor seiner Matura\, arrangierte er für den Orchesterleiter Teddy Stauffer und andere. 1941 spielte er Trompete in der Band von Fred Böhler\, ab 1942 unter dem Künstlernamen «Hazy Osterwald». Bei den «Original Teddies» des Saxophonisten Eddie Brunner\, dem Nachfolger Stauffers\, spielte er 1944 Klavier und Trompete\, gründete aber im gleichen Jahr eine eigene achtköpfige Combo mit der Sängerin Kitty Ramon. Am 1. September 1944 kam das erste Engagement im Dancing Chikito in Bern. Die Erweiterung zur Bigband erwies sich als zu teuer\, und so gründete er nach dem Vorbild von Svend Asmussen am 1. Mai 1949 sein Sextett\, mit dem er noch im selben Jahr auf dem Festival International 1949 de Jazz in Paris spielte\, wo auch Grössen wie Charlie Parker und Sidney Bechet auftraten.

COL title VAL Så skimrande var aldrig havet COL performer VAL Göran Ringbom	COL video title VAL ♥ "Red Roses for a Blue Lady" - The Lettermen COL description VAL Song: Red Roses for a Blue Lady Singers: The Lettermen  The making of this video: This music video is a compilation of photos that I have previously taken (except the wedding gown photo).  The lovely lady wearing very deep dark blue dress who became the "circumstantial" or "incidental" subject of this video just happened to be walking towards my direction when I was trying to take the photo of the Shibuya Station (渋谷駅) Exit towards the famous Shibuya Hachiko (忠犬 ハチ公).  (See Wikipedia and type in "Hachiko" for this story.)  The HMV Music Store is a "shop till you drop" music store near Shibuya JR train & the Metro subway station in Tokyo.  It was my YT friend (60otaku3) who gave me the info where to find it in the Tokyo maze.   The floribunda red roses were from my garden.  The San-ai flower shop is in the prime corner spot of Ginza\, a very high class shopping district of downtown Tokyo. It was the blue roses of this flower shop that gave me the idea to make this video of this Lettermen song. Luckily this flower shop also had the white orchids on display.  Except for the beat and transitions\, my videos usually have no direct relation to the lyrics of the song.  This music video however has become a true composition and I like the outcome.  ***************************************  And to the beautiful Lady at Shibuya Station (渋谷駅): Thank you for wearing the right color and being at the right spot at the perfect time when I clicked the camera shutter.  That photo was taken at 1:34 p.m. on July 3\, 2008.  - COL channel name VAL 65Seasons	0

This is proven true\, given the fact that I recently discovered her albums—and I just haven't had my fill. I've searched and purchased everything I could find from such a gifted songstress. Lorez crafts each lyric with such grace and tonality that could easily match (if not surpass) the reigning jazz stylists of the bop/jazz/pop age. She gives each standard a new sense of evocative meaning as far as lyrics are concerned\, and reinvents the wheel each time she unleashes her enthralling voice. As she once said "A lyric is dead\, until you breathe life into it." This is exactly what she does. Enjoy and listen in HD\, to the lovely—Lorez Alexandria.

It was originally recorded by George Benson for his 1984 album 20/20.  The song achieved worldwide success in a cover version by Hawaiian singer Glenn Medeiros in 1987 and 1988.  Medeiros originally released this on a small independent label at the age of 16\, after winning a local radio talent contest in Hawaii. A visiting radio executive from KZZP in Phoenix\, Arizona heard the song and took the record back to Phoenix\, where\, through word of mouth\, it became a national hit. A massive worldwide hit\, it reached Number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 and spent four weeks at number one on the UK singles chart in July 1988.  The music video features Medeiros with a girl in a pink dress strolling around a beach.  Glenn Medeiros also recorded the song in Spanish under the title Nada cambiará mi amor por ti.  The song became quite popular in Spanish-speaking countries when Argentine singer-songwriter Sergio Denis also recorded a cover version for his album Afectos (1985)\, with Spanish lyrics written by Rolando J. Hernández.  In 2009\, the song was used in France in a television advert for Spongex sponges.[1] COL channel name VAL Yllor Shapeshift	0

Their marriage ended in 1957\, but his love for her never did. It was an unusually amicable ending caused by his drinking problem and the seperate success she began to have when she went into rock & roll as Jean Chapel. Sadly he was left in the wings.   He passed away on Jan.1\, 1970\, and she passed on Aug. 12\, 1995. Both had remarried\, but the bond had never been truly broken between them\, mainly because of their daughter Lana.  Lana and her Mom\, whom he always called Mattie\, drank a private toast together to him every New Year's Eve after his death. New Year's Eve was his favorite and most sentimental occassion...and strangely enough\, he lived through New Year's Eve of 1969 in the hospital to die in the early hours of New Year's Day\, 1970.  Both Salty and Matiie had the same birthday of Mar. 6th..though different years. They had a truly psychic connection.  Maybe they're jamming again on that big stage in the sky..... Lana would surely like to think so\, for she'd like to get back into the act again someday.... COL channel name VAL SALTYHOLMES	1

COL title VAL My Little Suede Shoes COL performer VAL Charlie Parker	COL video title VAL The Charlie Daniels Band - Sharp Dressed Man.wmv COL description VAL Tailgate Party This CD contains some of the greatest rock songs of all time. Originally made legendary by some of the south's best rock bands\, Charlie adds his own unique sound to each song. Originals\, live and studio versions make this collection live up to its' name by being a great one to pull out during a "Tailgate Party."   Description      13 Tracks previously released in 1999     Engineered\, Produced and Mixed by: Ron W. Griffin     Executive Producer: David Corlew  Guide Review - Charlie Daniels Band - Tailgate Party  Included on this very southern rock flavored collection are live versions of "The Legend of Wooley Swamp" and "The Devil Went Down to Georgia." With both songs being so well known and played a gazillion times\, it was refreshing to hear them live and just slightly different from what we are normally accustomed to.  "The South's Gonna Do It Again" had an added bonus to it by having a very early on in his career performance by Keith Urban\, showing us some very impressive guitar solo's. Remakes of ZZ Top's "Sharp Dressed Man" and Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Freebird" were very captivating and showed off some incredible fiddle playing by Charlie. Probably one of my most favorites was CDB's remake of the song made famous by Hootie and the Blowfish\, "Let Her Cry." Charlie has always been well known for his playing but under rated for his vocals. This song shows off just how well he can deliver some very heartfelt emotions and I really enjoyed listening to this new version.  If you have ever appreciated CDB\, you will really like this release. If for nothing else\, the diversity of the genre's and CDB being able to add the country sound without destroying the memory of the song.

COL title VAL Cry Me a River COL performer VAL Lils Mackintosh	COL video title VAL Cry Me A River - Cynthia Basinet COL description VAL Buy: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-standard/id580796214   Best known for her iconic sultry version of "Santa Baby"  Review: The song\, which speaks about sweet revenge\, has been revived very successfully by Cynthia Basinet. While there are hints of the original Julie London version\, Ms. Basinet's rendition is particularly bluesy\, while being a bit more sensual. Accompanied by a sensitive rhythm section\, the singer displays her beautiful voice on a version full of desire\, regret\, and quiet satisfaction at how the broken love affair turned out. The results are haunting and memorable." ~Scott Yanow\, author of ten jazz books including The Jazz Singers\, Jazz On Film and Jazz On Record 1917-76  Written by Arthur Hamilton Vocals - Cynthia Basinet Piano - Lee Musiker Acoustic Rhythm Guitar- Gerry Beaudoin Acoustic Bass- Jesse Williams Piano and Voice Recorded Nola Studios NYC NY Engineered and Mixed : Tim Kelher Post recording and Post Production : Produced by J.

COL title VAL Oh! laisse la partir COL performer VAL Johnny Hallyday avec Joey and The Showmen	COL video title VAL The Rivieras - Let's Have A Party 1964 COL description VAL From the LP "Let's Have A Party". Recorded February 1964 on USA Records #102.  Great! That was the reaction to The Rivieras almost a year ago in the town of La Porte\, Indiana. It was in La Porte that the group played their first professional performance at the "Tipon Terrace Danceland".  Bill Dobslaw\, 21 years old and a native of Sawyer\, Michigan\, at the request of the group\, took over as manager and vocalist when the original singer left for the Marines. The other members of the group\, whose ages average 18 and attend high school in South Bend\, Indiana\, are Paul Dennert\, drummer-Otto Nuss\, organist-Doug Gean\, bass guitar-Jim boal\, lead guitar-and Willie Gaut\, rhythm guitar.  After their initial performance The Rivieras received many requests for "California Sun"\, a song which they recorded in Chicago at the prompting of many fans. The record soon found its way on the local charts in Michigan and Indiana and was brought to the attention of Art Roberts\, DJ at WLS Radio in Chicago. Thanks to the efforts of that station and many others\, the song went on to become an international hit. The overnight success of The Rivieras has left them very appreciative of the many fans who have helped to make them the outstanding new group of 1964. COL channel name VAL leadsquirter	1

The name of the band was Noise Promotion Company and for the next few years will be established as one of the best live acts of the town.  Their line up was: George "Banduk" Apostolakis -- vocals and guitar (he played xylophone too later) Alex Apostolakis -- drums\, and Thodoros Kondouris -- bass.  Playing mainly a mixture of post punk and art rock with some funk elements\, they were always experimenting on stage trying to explore new styles and sounds.  They released 2 albums. 'Silence' and 'Catalog'. The band split after these two albums and later\, George "Banduk" toured and recorded with the blues band Blues Wire.  ------------------------  "Move on Up" is a song by Curtis Mayfield from his 1970 debut album Curtis. In 1971\, the song spent ten weeks in the top 50 of the UK Singles Chart\, but it did not chart in the United States. In 2001 Bran Van 3000 recorded "Astounded"\, which featured Curtis Mayfield singing the lyrics of "Move on Up". In 2008\, it was used at the end of the movie Semi-Pro\, starring Will Ferrell and was covered by Lettuce featuring Dwele on Rage! album\, as well as Los Fabulosos Cadillacs on the 2009 album El Arte De La Elegancia De LFC (under the Spanish title "Vamos Ya"). It was covered by The Flying Lizards on their 1981 Fourth Wall LP. It was also covered by The Jam on the 1982 "Beat Surrender" EP. It was featured prominently in the Wire episode Margin of Error (The Wire)\, as the ex-con Dennis "Cutty" Wise jogs across town listening to the song on Election Day.  Disco version  In 1979\, disco trio\, Destination\, recorded the song\, incorporating the song\, "Keep on Pushing"\, a 1964 hit by The Impressions. Along with the tracks\, "Up Up Up" and "Destination's Theme\, "Move on Up"\, hit number one on the disco chart for four weeks. It peaked at number sixty-eight on the soul singles chart.  "Move On Up" is regularly featured in concerts by the Hip-Hop group The Roots.  It is played after each Arsenal FC game played at the Emirates Stadium.  It is featured in the 1974 U.S. film "The Groove Tube".  It is also featured in the 2002 British film Bend It Like Beckham.  It was also heavily sampled for the Kanye West song "Touch the Sky"\, from West's album Late Registration.  Angelique Kidjo made an African version of Move On Up featuring Bono and John Legend on her album Oyo. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0
COL title VAL Poor Little Rich Girl COL performer VAL Chris Connor	COL video title VAL Georges Boulanger's "Avant de mourir " as a French love song.... (1939) COL description VAL Please activate the HD function(720p) before watching the video or watch it with a larger type player in 480p!  This in order to avoid serious sound distortion (as YT continues to reduce sound quality and does not activate HD or HQ playback automatically).  "Avant de mourir" (lit. Before I die) was composed by famed Romanian violinist\, composer and conductor Georges Boulanger (1893-1958). It is a beautiful haunting sad melody which became a enormous hit for Boulanger. In 1939 English lyrics were added to the music and "Avant de mourir" became "My prayer" -recorded by the orchestra of Glenn Miller and other bands...  In France "Avant de mourir" was featured in the Casino de Paris spectacle "Amours de Paris" starring Maurice Chevalier.  The title was changed to "Tout nous parle d'amour" (lit. Everything speaks to us of love) although another set of lyrics with the title "Ma prière" was written as well.... In 1958 the song was revived by The Platters and spent 21 weeks at number 1 in the US charts.  The version presented in this video was recorded by the orchestra of AJ Pesenti - a popular tango orchestra from the late 1930s...  The video features images of Paris from the 1930s....  About the record :  Pathé PA. 1673/ mx. CPT 4528 Paris\, 1939  Record in quite good condition.   This record was transferred with a 78rpm phono preamp and Orofon Om78 cartridge and stylus in order to get an acceptable 78rpm playback. COL channel name VAL Leotaurus1975	0

She quickly became a popular attraction. Hall left the Taft in 1940\, taking Dolly with him. In July of 1941 he grew weary of leading a band and turned over his orchestra to Dolly\, renaming it Dolly Dawn and her Dawn Patrol. Dolly was successful leading the group\, but the stress of the job soon got to her. Her singing career was doing quite well\, and she found it easier to book herself solo than with the band. In March of 1942 she gave up the orchestra. COL channel name VAL warholsoup100	0

COL title VAL On Green Dolphin Street COL performer VAL Paul Horn Four	COL video title VAL Kenny Drew - On Green Dolphin Street (1985). COL description VAL Drew was born in New York City in 1928 and received piano lessons from the age of five.He attended The High School of Music & Art in Manhattan. Drew's first recording\, in 1950\, was with Howard McGhee\, and over the next two years he worked in bands led by Buddy DeFranco\, Coleman Hawkins\, Lester Young\, and Charlie Parker\, among others.After a brief period with his own trio in California\, Drew returned to New York\, playing with Dinah Washington\, Johnny Griffin\, Buddy Rich\, and several others over the following few years.He led many recording sessions throughout the '50s\, and in 1957 appeared on John Coltrane's album Blue Train.  Drew was one of several American jazz musicians who settled in Europe around this period: he moved to Paris in 1961 and to Copenhagen three years later.While he sacrificed much of the interest of the American jazz audience\, he gained a wide following across Europe. Kenny Drew was a well-known figure on the Copenhagen jazz scene\, recording many sessions with the Danish bassist Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen. "Living in Copenhagen\, and travelling out from there\," Drew remarked\, "I have probably worked in more different contexts than if I had stayed in New York where I might have got musically locked in with a set-group of musicians. This way\, I have been able to keep my musical antennas in shape\, while at the same time I have had more time to study and also get deeper into my own endeavors."  Drew and Dexter Gordon appeared on screen in Ole Ege's theatrically released hardcore pornographic film Pornografi - en musical (1971)\, for which they composed and performed the score.  Drew died in 1993 and was interred in the Assistens Cemetery in Norrebro\, Copenhagen. He has a street named after him in southern Copenhagen\, "Kenny Drews Vej" (Eng.\, Kenny Drew Street).  His son\, Kenny Drew\, Jr.\, was also a jazz pianist. _______________________________________________________________________________________________ Tracklist: 1.On Green Dolphin Street (T.Washington/B.Kaper) _______________________________________________________________________________________________   Personnel: 1.Kenny Drew - piano  2.Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen - bass  3.Ed Thigpen - drums. _______________________________________________________________________________________________  Genre:Jazz/Hard Bop/Contemporary Jazz Recorded: at Easy Sound Studio\, Copenhagen;August 24-25\, 1985.

COL title VAL No More Boleros COL performer VAL Gerard Joling	COL video title VAL Ned Miller - From A Jack To A King 1963 Philips -- 318 882 PF.wmv COL description VAL enry Ned Miller (born April 12\, 1925\, Rains\, Carbon County\, Utah)[2] is an American country music artist. Active as a recording artist from 1956 to 1970\, he is known primarily for his hit single\, "From a Jack to a King"\, a crossover hit in 1962 which reached Top 10 on the country music\, adult contemporary\, and Billboard Hot 100 charts. He had several more chart singles in his career\, though none matched the peak of "From a Jack to a King". He composed and recorded "Invisible Tears\," which was later recorded by Connie Smith\, Bobby Bare\, and the Ray Conniff Singers.Biography  Miller's start as a songwriter came when he was sixteen years old.[2] He later joined the United States Marine Corps\, from which he was later discharged. In 1956\, both Gale Storm and Bonnie Guitar had Top Five hits with different versions of the song "Dark Moon"\, which Miller co-wrote.[2] Another song he wrote "A Falling Star"\, was a country hit for Jimmy C. Newman. Very notable is also his uptempo song "Cave In"\, which in 1960 was the flip side of Warren Smiths\, #5 country hit "I Don't Believe I'll Fall In Love Today" recorded for the Liberty records label. He also wrote and recorded a song called "From a Jack to a King"\, which was released on Fabor Records but saw little success on the charts.[3] After being briefly signed to Capitol Records\, Miller returned to Fabor and persuaded them to re-release "From a Jack to a King". The song proved successful the second time around\, and became a crossover hit for Miller.[2] It sold over two million copies by July 1963\, and was awarded a gold disc.[4]  Miller was not particularly interested in his singing career\, and rarely toured owing to stage fright.[3] He gave up recording in the 1970s and soon moved to Prescott\, Arizona\, and later to Las Vegas\, Nevada.[3]  Country music artist Ricky Van Shelton covered "From a Jack to a King" in the 1980s; his version reached Number One on the country music chart.[2] [edit] Discography [edit] Albums Year  Album  Chart Positions  Label U.S. Country  U.S. 1963  From a Jack to a King   50  Fabor 1965  Ned Miller Sings the Songs of Ned Miller    Capitol The Best of Ned Miller  28   1967  Teardrop Lane  22   1968  In the Name of Love    1970  Ned Miller's Back    Republic 1981  From a Jack to a King    Plantation [edit] Singles Year  Single  U.S. Country  U.S.  U.S. AC  UK[5]  IRE  Album 1957  "Roll O' Rollin' Stone"  —  —  —  —  —  singles only "From a Jack to a King"  —  —  —  —  — "Lights in the Street"  —  —  —  —  — 1958  "Gypsy"  —  —  —  —  — 1959  "Ring the Bell for Johnny"  —  —  —  —  — 1961  "Cold Gray Bars"  —  —  —  —  — "Dark Moon"  —  —  —  —  — 1962  "From a Jack to a King" (re-release)  2  6  3  2  1  From a Jack to a King 1963  "One Among the Many"  27  —  —  —  — "Another Fool Like Me"  28  —  —  —  —  singles only "Big Love"  —  —  —  —  — 1964  "Invisible Tears"  13  131  —  —  —  The Best 1965  "Do What You Do Do Well"  7  52  —  48  — "Two Voices\, Two Shadows\, Two Faces"  —  —  —  —  —  Songs of Ned Miller "Whistle Walkin'"  28  —  —  —  — "Down the Street"  —  —  —  —  — 1966  "Lovin' Pains"  —  —  —  —  —  The Best "Summer Roses"  39  —  —  —  —  Teardrop Lane "Teardrop Lane"  44  —  —  —  — 1967  "Echo of the Pines"  —  —  —  —  —  singles only "Hobo"  53  —  —  —  — 1968  "Only a Fool"  61  —  —  —  —  In the Name of Love 1969  "Autumn Winds"  —  —  —  —  —  singles only 1970  "Breakin'"  —  —  —  —  — "Lover's Song"  39  —  —  —  —  Ned Miller's Back "Back to Oklahoma"  —  —  —  —  — COL channel name VAL Amnondoowop	0

Herbert Jay Solomon (April 16\, 1930  July 1\, 2003)\, better known as Herbie Mann\, was a Jewish American jazz flautist and important early practitioner of world music. Early in his career\, he also played saxophones and clarinets (including bass clarinet)\, but Mann was among the first jazz musicians to specialize on the flute and was perhaps jazz music's preeminent flautist during the 1960s.

COL title VAL If I Only Had a Brain COL performer VAL Robbie Williams	COL video title VAL The Rivieras - Let's Have A Party 1964 COL description VAL From the LP "Let's Have A Party". Recorded February 1964 on USA Records #102.  Great! That was the reaction to The Rivieras almost a year ago in the town of La Porte\, Indiana. It was in La Porte that the group played their first professional performance at the "Tipon Terrace Danceland".  Bill Dobslaw\, 21 years old and a native of Sawyer\, Michigan\, at the request of the group\, took over as manager and vocalist when the original singer left for the Marines. The other members of the group\, whose ages average 18 and attend high school in South Bend\, Indiana\, are Paul Dennert\, drummer-Otto Nuss\, organist-Doug Gean\, bass guitar-Jim boal\, lead guitar-and Willie Gaut\, rhythm guitar.  After their initial performance The Rivieras received many requests for "California Sun"\, a song which they recorded in Chicago at the prompting of many fans. The record soon found its way on the local charts in Michigan and Indiana and was brought to the attention of Art Roberts\, DJ at WLS Radio in Chicago. Thanks to the efforts of that station and many others\, the song went on to become an international hit. The overnight success of The Rivieras has left them very appreciative of the many fans who have helped to make them the outstanding new group of 1964. COL channel name VAL leadsquirter	0

Via della povertà    (versione LIVE eseguita a Viareggio nei primi anni "80)   Il Salone di bellezza in fondo al vicolo  è affollatissimo di marinai  prova a chiedere a uno che ore sono  e ti risponderà "non l'ho saputo mai".  Le cartoline dell'impiccagione  sono in vendita a cento lire l'una  il commissario cieco dietro la stazione  per un indizio ti legge la sfortuna  e le forze dell'ordine irrequiete  cercano qualcosa che non va  mentre io e la mia signora ci affacciamo stasera su via della Povertà. Signorile sembra così facile  ogni volta che sorride ti cattura  ricorda proprio Bette Davis  con le mani appoggiate alla cintura.  Arriva Lombardi trafelato  e le grida "la sinistra sei tu!"  ma qualcuno gli dice di andar via  perché ormai non esiste piu' e l'unico suono che rimane  quando l'ambulanza se ne va  è Signorile che spazza la strada  in via della Povertà. Mentre l'alba sta uccidendo la luna  e le stelle si son quasi nascoste  la signora che legge la fortuna  se n'è andata in compagnia dell'oste.  Ad eccezione di Abele e di Caino  tutti quanti sono andati a far l'amore  aspettando che venga la pioggia  ad annacquare la gioia ed il dolore  e il Cardinal Marcinkus sta affilando la sua pietà  se ne andrà a far la questua stasera  in via della Povertà. Al Quirinale sono disperati  Sandro Pertini è diventato vecchio  e Andreatta piange sconcertato  vedendo Craxi che ride nello specchio.  Sofia è dietro la finestra  tutti quanti le hanno detto che è bella  non ha ancora 53 anni  e mai nessuno l'ha chiamata zitella  la sua fuga sarà molto romantica  trasformandosi in oro se ne andrà  si è stufata di andare avanti e indietro in via della Povertà. Mongolfini travestito da pallone  ha nascosto i suoi appunti in un baule  è passato di qui un'ora fa  diretto verso l'ultima Thule\,  sembrava così timido e impaurito  quando ha chiesto di fermarsi un po' qui  ma poi ha cominciato a fumare  e a recitare l'A B C  ed a vederlo tu non lo diresti mai  ma era famoso qualche tempo fa  per suonare il violino elettrico  in via della Povertà. Ci si prepara per la grande festa  c'è qualcuno che comincia ad aver sete  Woityla ha gettato la ghiara si è travestito in abiti da prete  sta ingozzando a viva forza Berlinguer per punirlo della sua frugalità lo ucciderà parlandogli d'amore  dopo averlo avvelenato di pietà  e mentre Woityla grida  4 suore si son spogliate già  Berlinguer sta per essere violentato  in via della Povertà. E bravo Carboni mattacchione  il paese sta affondando nella merda e gli Anarchici tutti annegati e il capitano grida "ce ne stanno ancora"\,  e Agnelli e Indro Montanelli  fanno a pugni nella torre di comando  i suonatori di calipso ridono di loro  mentre il cielo si sta allontanando  e affacciati alle loro finestre nel mare  tutti pescano garofani e lillà  e nessuno deve più preoccuparsi  di via della Povertà. Il tuo articolo l'ho letto proprio ieri  ci hai messo dentro tutto quel che sai ma non essere ridicolo  non chiedermi "come stai"\,  questa gente di cui mi vai parlando  è quasi gente come tutti noi  non mi sembra che siano mostri  e né tanto meno eroi  e non mandarmi altre bozze da correggere nessuno ti risponderà  se non provi a spedirmi i tuoi articoli da via della Povertà.  Attraverso il gioco del rovescio della canzone di De André ha luogo la demitizzazione e la demistificazione. Via della Povertà ne offre un illuminato esempio. Marinai che affollano un salone di bellezza\, un commissario cieco che predice la sfortuna\, una Cenerentola non più ritrosa e fuggitiva ma spavalda ed energica come Bette Davis\, un Romeo che viene scacciato mentre fa la sua dichiarazione d'amore\, il Buon Samaritano che affila la pietà come se fosse un'arma e la indossa come una maschera di carnevale\, Mister Hyde in lacrime vedendo la sua parte cosiddetta sana "che ride nello specchio"\, un'Ofelia che si scopre zitella\, un Albert Einstein "travestito da ubriacone"\, il fantasma dell'opera "vestito in abiti da prete"\, un Casanova che "sta per essere violentato"\, il dio del mare che si diverte a far scendere negli abissi il Titanic mentre il sole si sta alzando: sono alcuni dei personaggi di un mondo carnevalizzato\, maschere di un teatrino dell'assurdo forse\, ma rivelatori di un modo d'essere degli uomini: "è gente come tutti noi / non mi sembra che siano mostri / non mi sembra che siano eroi".

COL title VAL Nature Boy COL performer VAL Engelbert Humperdinck	COL video title VAL SALTY HOLMES - Blue Eyes Cryin' in the Rain.wmv COL description VAL Recorded by Salty in the 40's\, it is now an ironic tribute to the love of his life\, Mattie O'Neil aka Jean Chapel. Their marriage ended in 1957\, but his love for her never did. It was an unusually amicable ending caused by his drinking problem and the seperate success she began to have when she went into rock & roll as Jean Chapel. Sadly he was left in the wings.   He passed away on Jan.1\, 1970\, and she passed on Aug. 12\, 1995. Both had remarried\, but the bond had never been truly broken between them\, mainly because of their daughter Lana.  Lana and her Mom\, whom he always called Mattie\, drank a private toast together to him every New Year's Eve after his death. New Year's Eve was his favorite and most sentimental occassion...and strangely enough\, he lived through New Year's Eve of 1969 in the hospital to die in the early hours of New Year's Day\, 1970.  Both Salty and Matiie had the same birthday of Mar. 6th..though different years. They had a truly psychic connection.  Maybe they're jamming again on that big stage in the sky..... Lana would surely like to think so\, for she'd like to get back into the act again someday.... COL channel name VAL SALTYHOLMES	0

Welle: Erdball -- Ganz In Weiß  ------------------------  "Walk on the Wild Side" is a Lou Reed song from his 1972 second solo album Transformer. It was produced by David Bowie. The song received wide radio coverage\, despite its touching on taboo topics such as transsexuality\, drugs\, male prostitutes and oral sex and the term "colored" to refer to African Americans. In the United States\, RCA released an edited version of song as a single which eliminated the song's reference to oral sex.  It is usually regarded as Reed's best-known solo work. The song reached #16 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100\, and #10 in the UK. In 2003\, the song was ranked #221 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.  Covers  This song was covered by Company B\, on their album "Jam on Me." In February 1990\, two club/hiphop versions charted simultaneously in the UK - Jamie J. Morgan's cover produced by Richard Mazda reached #27\, whilst Beat System got to #63. In 1985\, 79-year old veteran German actress Gerty Molzen recorded her own version of the song\, cleaning up some of the lyrics in the process. She performed it on the David Letterman show in the US and on Gay Byrne's Late Late Show in Ireland. Echo & the Bunnymen usually merge this in concert with Nothing Lasts Forever. A 2005 song by artist RX featured George W. Bush "singing" a mixture of John Lennon's "Imagine" and the chorus from "Walk on the Wild Side". Irish/Australian comedian Jimeoin covered the song in 1993 on his music/comedy CD\, Goin' Off. The song featured the line "You should have seen them go go go\, I said G-O-G-G-O\, take a walk on the wildside" as a reference to the popular Yellow Pages ad on TV at the time. The Strokes and Robbie Williams played the full song or a snippet during their last tours. The band Sponge have been known to break into the song in the middle of playing their hit "Have You Seen Mary?" in live performances. The Rentals also play it live before transitioning into their hit "Friends of P". Train sings this song for the Bay Area's local station KFOG\, on a CD called Live From The Archives: Vol. 11\, as a part of the KFOG Kaboom Medley. A short part of the song was often used by Bono during performances of Bad in the mid eighties. Most notably performed at Live Aid in London. At a charity event\, Lou Reed played this song with comedians Conan O'Brien\, Jimmy Fallon\, Adam Sandler\, and Jack Black. Each person took on one verse of the song. Vanessa Paradis covered the song in her album Variations sur le même t'aime. Jesse Malin covered it on On Your Sleeve\, a cover album released in 2008. Young@Heart\, an entertainment group created by and for the elderly\, composed of people at least 70 years of age\, perform this song in concert. Moby includes the song in his concerts. During Exit Festival 2009\, he referred to it as "his favourite song about New York." Editors covered this song on 2007. Cover can be found on album Rhythms del Mundo Classics. Australian band Yves Klein Blue covered the song on the radio segment 'Like a Version' on Triple J in 2010 Trumpeter Rick Braun covered the song from 2005 album "Yours Truly." The German group Tok Tok Tok covers this song in their album "I wish" in 2005. The French group Pink Turtle gives this song a Jazz Age twist in their album "Reprise! When jazz meets pop #3" (2007).  Media Appearances  In a scene from the film Hedwig and the Angry Inch Hedwig starts singing it while in an oven. This song is usually the opening to Danny Masterson's LA radio show\, "Feel My Heat". Natalie Portman sings the line "And the colored girls go Doo\, doo\, doo\, doo\, doo\, doo\, doo\, doo" in the film Beautiful Girls. In the television show Medium\, the episode "Lady Killer" featured the tune of "Walk on the Wild side" (with no lyrics) during Patricia Arquette's character's dreams about a woman seducing men\, and perhaps gave a clue to who the actual killer was. The bassline of this song is used in the Gatorade G2 commercial. In the movie Guess Who this song is playing on the radio while Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher are driving in the car. In the film The Salton Sea an old man with a tracheotomy sings the song on a karaoke machine in a bar. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

The song was published in 1957.  The biggest hit version of the song was recorded by Perry Como in 1957\, and became a hit in early 1958. The peak position is hard to track precisely\, due to the multiple charts used in Billboard. The overall impact of the song probably fell just below the top ten. The song was also a 1958 hit in Italy\, while in the United Kingdom it spent eight weeks at number one\, becoming Como's biggest ever hit there. A much less successful UK cover version recorded by Ronnie Hilton reached #22 on the UK Singles Chart.  Amanda Lear recorded this song for her 1985 EP A L.  Synthpop duo Erasure recorded the song for their 1997 album Cowboy. Their version is featured in the Clive Barker film Lord of Illusions\, providing the background music to a magicians' convention.  Magic Moments is also the name given to a Surprise\, Surprise style show within the BBC television film Pat and Margaret. Its theme music is the song itself and as the coach carrying various members of the audience sets off at the start of the film\, they start singing it.  This song was used in the television commercial for Quality Street\, a confectionery brand in the UK in the 1980s and continues to be used each year for the brand's Christmas advertisements.  The song is also occasionally sung by Ulster Rugby fans at away matches\, particularly after 'magic moments' of play.  The Perry Como version is featured in the 1998 film\, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\, when Raoul arrives at a Vegas hotel where Dr. Gonzo is located\, briefly in Dogma (1999)\, Two Weeks Notice (2002)\, Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason (2004)\, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (2005)\, and Episode 3 of the first season of the 2012 BBC series Call the Midwife\, which is set in 1957.

Their line up was: George "Banduk" Apostolakis -- vocals and guitar (he played xylophone too later) Alex Apostolakis -- drums\, and Thodoros Kondouris -- bass.  Playing mainly a mixture of post punk and art rock with some funk elements\, they were always experimenting on stage trying to explore new styles and sounds.  They released 2 albums. 'Silence' and 'Catalog'. The band split after these two albums and later\, George "Banduk" toured and recorded with the blues band Blues Wire.  ------------------------  "Move on Up" is a song by Curtis Mayfield from his 1970 debut album Curtis. In 1971\, the song spent ten weeks in the top 50 of the UK Singles Chart\, but it did not chart in the United States. In 2001 Bran Van 3000 recorded "Astounded"\, which featured Curtis Mayfield singing the lyrics of "Move on Up". In 2008\, it was used at the end of the movie Semi-Pro\, starring Will Ferrell and was covered by Lettuce featuring Dwele on Rage! album\, as well as Los Fabulosos Cadillacs on the 2009 album El Arte De La Elegancia De LFC (under the Spanish title "Vamos Ya"). It was covered by The Flying Lizards on their 1981 Fourth Wall LP. It was also covered by The Jam on the 1982 "Beat Surrender" EP. It was featured prominently in the Wire episode Margin of Error (The Wire)\, as the ex-con Dennis "Cutty" Wise jogs across town listening to the song on Election Day.  Disco version  In 1979\, disco trio\, Destination\, recorded the song\, incorporating the song\, "Keep on Pushing"\, a 1964 hit by The Impressions. Along with the tracks\, "Up Up Up" and "Destination's Theme\, "Move on Up"\, hit number one on the disco chart for four weeks. It peaked at number sixty-eight on the soul singles chart.  "Move On Up" is regularly featured in concerts by the Hip-Hop group The Roots.  It is played after each Arsenal FC game played at the Emirates Stadium.  It is featured in the 1974 U.S. film "The Groove Tube".  It is also featured in the 2002 British film Bend It Like Beckham.  It was also heavily sampled for the Kanye West song "Touch the Sky"\, from West's album Late Registration.

COL title VAL Midnight Special COL performer VAL Little Richard	COL video title VAL Georges Boulanger's "Avant de mourir " as a French love song.... (1939) COL description VAL Please activate the HD function(720p) before watching the video or watch it with a larger type player in 480p!  This in order to avoid serious sound distortion (as YT continues to reduce sound quality and does not activate HD or HQ playback automatically).  "Avant de mourir" (lit. Before I die) was composed by famed Romanian violinist\, composer and conductor Georges Boulanger (1893-1958). It is a beautiful haunting sad melody which became a enormous hit for Boulanger. In 1939 English lyrics were added to the music and "Avant de mourir" became "My prayer" -recorded by the orchestra of Glenn Miller and other bands...  In France "Avant de mourir" was featured in the Casino de Paris spectacle "Amours de Paris" starring Maurice Chevalier.  The title was changed to "Tout nous parle d'amour" (lit. Everything speaks to us of love) although another set of lyrics with the title "Ma prière" was written as well.... In 1958 the song was revived by The Platters and spent 21 weeks at number 1 in the US charts.  The version presented in this video was recorded by the orchestra of AJ Pesenti - a popular tango orchestra from the late 1930s...  The video features images of Paris from the 1930s....  About the record :  Pathé PA. 1673/ mx. CPT 4528 Paris\, 1939  Record in quite good condition.   This record was transferred with a 78rpm phono preamp and Orofon Om78 cartridge and stylus in order to get an acceptable 78rpm playback. COL channel name VAL Leotaurus1975	0

Though one can still hear the formative Django Reinhardt harmonic influence in the single-string runs\, Paul's showboating style is fully formed here\, marked by humor and mind-boggling speed\, but also by a lyrical gift in ballads like "Stardust." The songs\, mostly standards and uncredited public domain material\, are all rather brief\, but that imposes a welcome discipline on the solos\, although Paul did tend to repeat certain ideas from song to song at that time. The CD box fails to name the members of the trio\, but one can surmise from the year that Paul Smith is on piano\, Cal Gooden is on rhythm guitar\, and Bob Meyer is on bass; and they make a nifty\, tight-knit foursome."

Available in physical form direct from website http://HistoryofRnB.net   Download from   Amazon http://www.amazon.co.uk/Those-Hoodlum-Friends-Coasters-Stereo/dp/B00BR0QU6A/ref=dm_cd_album_lnk  iTunes https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/those-hoodlum-friends-coasters/id609884465    Stream from Spotify http://open.spotify.com/album/6IDmQkLUjCQe6poBO4izrg   The Coasters had the benefit of recording in the best studios\, backed by the best musicians and produced by the top producers of their generation\, Leiber and Stoller. Naturally\, they were required to run through as many takes of each song as was necessary to satisfy the exacting demands of their mentors. Luckily for us\, many of these alternate takes have survived. Mono was the standard recording format until the late 1960s\, but many of the big selling artists also recorded alternate versions specifically for the stereo market\, which was targeted to the discerning adult listener.     Disc One features all the alternate stereo versions of Coasters songs that were issued at the time on album and subsequently on CD. Disc Two takes you deep into the heart of Coasters sessions with composite tracks which combine studio chatter together with the finest moments from various different takes. This disc contains several outtakes which have until now been unavailable anywhere and gives an invaluable insight into the genesis of many well-loved tracks and also into the character and working practice of the Coasters and of their producers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller.     The accompanying 24-page booklet includes many rare photos and an exhaustive session discography by Claus Röhnisch. A collection for Coasters and early rock 'n' roll aficionados!

(1939) COL description VAL Please activate the HD function(720p) before watching the video or watch it with a larger type player in 480p!  This in order to avoid serious sound distortion (as YT continues to reduce sound quality and does not activate HD or HQ playback automatically).  "Avant de mourir" (lit. Before I die) was composed by famed Romanian violinist\, composer and conductor Georges Boulanger (1893-1958). It is a beautiful haunting sad melody which became a enormous hit for Boulanger. In 1939 English lyrics were added to the music and "Avant de mourir" became "My prayer" -recorded by the orchestra of Glenn Miller and other bands...  In France "Avant de mourir" was featured in the Casino de Paris spectacle "Amours de Paris" starring Maurice Chevalier.  The title was changed to "Tout nous parle d'amour" (lit. Everything speaks to us of love) although another set of lyrics with the title "Ma prière" was written as well.... In 1958 the song was revived by The Platters and spent 21 weeks at number 1 in the US charts.  The version presented in this video was recorded by the orchestra of AJ Pesenti - a popular tango orchestra from the late 1930s...  The video features images of Paris from the 1930s....  About the record :  Pathé PA. 1673/ mx. CPT 4528 Paris\, 1939  Record in quite good condition.

Note to all my AMP friends: this is a RE-UPLOAD. I first uploaded this song on 05/26/2010 for Father's Day ~WhiteLibraTexas~ --------------------------------------------------------------------  Many lists have been compiled for the Seven Natural Wonders of the World; however\, the list compiled by CNN is the most recognized. Although all of these seven natural wonders are still in existence today\, and are still being adored by many tourists across the globe\, the New7Wonders Foundation launched a campaign in 2007 to select a new list of natural wonders. The declaration of the New Seven Natural Wonders of the World will take place in 2011.  The Following is CNN list of seven breathtaking wonders of the world created by nature itself\, in random order:  1. Magical dancing lights\, performing through the night! -- AURORA BOREALIS (Alaska) 2. A thousand tiny islands in one mountain cupped bay\, no way! -- HARBOR OF RIO DE JANEIRO (Brazil) 3. A canyon so vast\, and carved out of the past! -- GRAND CANYON (USA) 4. A giant coral reef\, with fish beyond belief! -- GREAT BARRIER REEF (Australia) 5.  A mountain so high it almost reaches the sky! -- MOUNT EVEREST (Himalayas) 6.  A volcano that grew\, nearly right in front of you! -- PARICUTIN VOLCANO (Mexico) 7.  Falls so tall\, a dinosaur would feel small! - VICTORIA FALLS (South Africa)       ~Planetpals~ ---------------------------------------------------- DADDY'S LOVE (an acrostic poem)  Daddy's love\, so beautiful Aurora\, you're colorful\, but not as wonderful Daddy's love\, can never be detached Deep Grand Canyon\, you're so vast\, but not a match  Yesterdays\, today and into tomorrows Surpassing all sorrow 'though times are borrowed Love of Daddy\, so solid\, like Mount Kilimanjaro Only his love is indestructible and so magical Victoria Falls\, you're fantastic\, but you don't have his magic  Endless love and wind beneath my wings\, that's my Daddy!  ~I love you\, Daddy! Happy Father's Day - From WhiteLibraTexas~ ----------------------------------------------------------  I picked the featured song\, "Wind Beneath My Wings\," to dedicate to the coolest father on earth\, my Daddy\, and to all the wonderful fathers across the globe\, too. This song describes my feelings for my Daddy\, very perfectly.    This beautiful song has been recorded by many popular artists\, to include Roger Whittaker\, Gladys Knight\, Lou Rawls\, B.J. Thomas\, Sheena Easton\, and Bette Middler\, to name just a few. For this clip\, I am featuring a new version by the Canadian identical twin vocalists\, Ryan and Dan Kowarsky.

COL title VAL Bouřka (McArthur Park) COL performer VAL Helena Vondráčková	COL video title VAL Donna Summer - MacArthur Park Suite [Original Extended Version] (Casablanca Records 1977) COL description VAL "MacArthur Park" is a song by Jimmy Webb in 1968\, originally composed as part of an intended cantata. Richard Harris was the second to record it. Other covers include Donna Summer's disco arrangement from 1978 and Waylon Jennings's version recorded in 1969. Maynard Ferguson\, Stan Kenton\, and Woody Herman all performed big-band jazz arrangements.   "MacArthur Park" utilized flowery lyrics and metaphors (most famously\, love being likened to a cake left out in the rain) that were considered by media such as the Los Angeles Times to be "polarizing" and "loopy." The inspiration for "MacArthur Park" was the relationship and breakup between Webb and Susan Ronstadt\, a cousin of singer Linda Ronstadt. MacArthur Park was where the two occasionally met for lunch and spent their most enjoyable times together.   In 1978\, "MacArthur Park" by Donna Summer was number one on the American pop music sales charts for three weeks. "MacArthur Park Suite stayed at number one on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Songs chart for five weeks in 1978.  (LYRICS)  Spring was never waiting for us\, dear\, it ran one step ahead\, as we followed in the dance. Between the parted pages\, we were pressed\, In love's hot\, fevered iron like a striped pair of pants. MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark\, All the sweet\, green icing flowing down... Someone left the cake out in the rain\, I don't think that I can take it 'cause it took so long to bake it\, And I'll never have that recipe again\, Again! Aha!  I recall the yellow cotton dress\, foaming like a wave\, on the ground beneath your knees. The birds\, like tender babies in your hands and the old men playing Chinese checkers by the trees. MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark\, All the sweet\, green icing flowing down... Someone left the cake out in the rain\, I don't think that I can take it 'cause it took so long to bake it\, And I'll never have that recipe again\, Again! Aha!  There will be another song for me and I will sing it. They'll be another dream for me\, someone will bring it. I will drink the wine while it is warm and never let you catch me looking at the sun yea\, and after all the loves of my life\, after all the loves of my life you'll still be the one. I will take my life into my hands and I will use it. I will win the worship in their eyes and I will lose it. I will have the things that I desire and my passion flow like rivers from the sky. Oh and after all the loves of my life\, yea\, after all the loves of my life you'll still be the one and I'll ask myself why yea! MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark\, All the sweet\, green icing flowing down... Someone left the cake out in the rain\, I don't think that I can take it 'cause it took so long to bake it\, And I'll never have that recipe again\, Again!  You're one of a kind\, I gotta have ya\, well you're one of a kind\, I need to have ya! Right from the start you tore me apart\, you took the best part of my heart\, Aah! Body and soul\, you took me out of control. You stole the best part of my heart\, Aah! Ooh! You're one of a kind\, you've got magic. I know you're one of a kind\, baby you're static. Right from the start you tore me apart\, you took the best part of my heart\, Aah! Body and soul\, you took me out of control. You stole the best part of my heart\, Aah! Ooh! Right from the start you tore me apart\, you took the best part of my heart\, Aah! Body and soul\, you took me out of control. You stole the best part of my heart\, Aah! Ooh!

Silently (so silently) listen to the words I say (listen to the words I say) I'm not talking just for play (just for play) listen to me please (won't you listen to me).

Heaven knows I never wanna leave you\, heaven knows I only wanna please you\, don't you know love is what I need!   Down inside (down inside) don't get caught with foolish pride (don't get caught with foolish pride) blow the other things aside (things aside) it's only you and me (you and me\, you and)believe in us (believe in us) we were always meant to be (always meant to be) me for you and you for me (you for me) 'til eternity ('til eternity).

It was the lead single from their album Green River and was released in April 1969\, four months before the album. The song reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart for three weeks in September 1969. It was CCR's second gold single.  The song has been recorded by at least 20 different artists\, in styles ranging from folk to reggae to psychedelic rock.  In 2011\, Rolling Stone ranked it #364 on its "500 Greatest Songs of All Time" list.  Composition  Fogerty reportedly wrote "Bad Moon Rising" after watching The Devil and Daniel Webster. Inspired by a scene in the film involving a hurricane\, Fogerty claims the song is about "the apocalypse that was going to be visited upon us."  Mondegreen  The refrain in the chorus\, "there's a bad moon on the rise\," is commonly misheard as "there's a bathroom on the right". Fogerty has parodied the mishearing in live performances of the song.  Cover versions  Jerry Lee Lewis released a version of the song on his 1973 album\, The Session.  Fogerty and Lewis recorded a version together that was released on Lewis' 2010 album\, Mean Old Man.  Emmylou Harris released a version of the song on her 1981 album\, Evangeline.  A 1986 version by the Australian band the Reels reached number 11 on the Australian charts.  The Scottish traditional group Battlefield Band recorded a version for their 1987 album After Hours: Forward to Scotland's Past.  Soundtrack  The song has been used in a number of films\, including: An American Werewolf in London\, My Fellow Americans\, Twilight Zone: The Movie\, Blade\, Sweet Home Alabama\, My Girl\, Man of the House\, Mr. Woodcock and The Big Chill.  It has also appeared in many television programs\, including: Supernatural\, Cold Case\, Northern Exposure and Alvin and the Chipmunks\, in which it is performed by the titular characters.  A remixed version of the song can be heard in the video game Crackdown 2.  The song was available as a playable song for Guitar Hero 5 series of music rhythm video games as downloadable content.  Rock Band Music Gaming Platform  The song was made available to download on March 1\, 2011 for use in the Rock Band 3 music gaming platform in both Basic rhythm\, and PRO mode which takes advantage of the use of a real guitar / bass guitar\, along with standard MIDI-compatible electronic drum kits / keyboards in addition to three-part harmony vocals.

H. Auden ▼▼▼  GUNTER NORIS Gunter Noris was a famous German pianist\, composer\, arranger and bandleader. Noris studied music and composition in Wurzburg and joined the RIAS Tanzorchester in 1961 as pianist and assistant conductor. In 1966\, Hildegard Knef hired Noris as musical director for her first "Chanson Tournee". Noris left RIAS in 1967 and joined the West Deutsche Rundfunk (WDR) as bandleader\, arranger and pianist.  Noris erected the Big Band of the Bundeswehr in 1971 and performed both at the 1972 Munich Olympics and at the 1974 Football Championships with this band.  He re-arranged Herbert Rehbein's "Olympia Thema" and this title\, appropriately called "Swinging Olympia" became the tune of a famous radio program - "die Europarade".  He left the Bundeswehr in 1983 and founded his own band\, a band that soon would be very popular\, thanks to the so-called "Noris sound". His band was proclaimed "best dance orchestra in the world" in 1995 by the German dance organization ADTV (Algemeine Deutsche Tanz Verein) During his career\, which spanned nearly 40 years\, he appeared "live in concert" on more than 2500 occasions spread over 15 countries. German Bundespresident Richard von Weizsacker awarded the so called "Bundesverdienstkreuz" to Noris in 2005\, as a recognition for the fact that Noris' many charity concerts had generated millions of Euros (Deutsche Marks before 2000)  BUT NOT FOR ME "But Not for Me" is a popular song\, composed by George Gershwin\, with lyrics by Ira Gershwin. It was written for their musical Girl Crazy (1930) and introduced in the original production by Ginger Rogers. Numerous artists\, vocalists and instrumentalists alike\, have performed the song since it's initial release in 1930.  MHO A fine arrangement of Gershwin's "But Not For Me" with Noris demonstrating his superb skills as a pianist.  At the same time we can also enjoy his arranging skills - his piano playing is being accompanied by a gentle and well balanced orchestra and as such we get to hear a smooth and softly swinging version of this well known standard. This recording - from 1969 - obviously was made before the "Noris sound" was born but Noris' musicality and originality can be heard already here.  Enjoy ! COL channel name VAL Socratess2007	0
COL title VAL Barbara-Ann COL performer VAL The Regents	COL video title VAL Frankie and Johnny - Frank Crumit\, Paul Biese Trio (1921) COL description VAL Frankie and Johnny Words and music by Frank and Bert Leighton\, and Ren Shields Paul Biese Trio\, vocal  by Frank Crumit June 10\, 1921 Columbia A3459  Based on the 1899 murder of Allen Britt by Frankie Baker in St. Louis\, the first version was titled "Frankie and Albert". The first known published version of a "Frankie and Johnny" melody appeared in 1904 in the song "He Done Me Wrong (The Death Of Bill Bailey)"\, written by Hughie Cannon.  A variation on the melody\, with words and music by Frank and Bert Leighton\, appeared in 1908 under the title "Bill\, You Done Me Wrong". It was republished in 1912\, credited to the Leighton Brothers and Ren Shields\, as the more commonly recognizable "Frankie and Johnny".  The first known recording of Frankie and Johnny was in 1912\,  a vocal by Gene Greene accompanied by Charlie Straight on a very rare British Pathé 78 rpm disk.

COL title VAL Nature Boy COL performer VAL Engelbert Humperdinck	COL video title VAL Bobby Scott  "Nature Boy"      (1990) COL description VAL In 1941\, a 33 year old George McGrew arrived in Los Angeles and began playing piano in the Eutropheon\, a small health food store and raw food restaurant on Laurel Canyon Boulevard. The cafe was owned by John and Vera Richter\, German immigrants who followed a Naturmensch and Lebensreform philosophy influenced by the Wandervogel movement in Germany.Their followers\, known as "Nature Boys"\, wore long hair and beards and ate only raw fruits and vegetables. McGrew adopted the philosophy and chose the name "eden ahbez"\, writing and spelling his name with lower-case letters. It was there while living in a cave near Palm Springs\, ahbez wrote "Nature Boy". Partly autobiographical\, the song was a tribute to his mentor Bill Pester\, who had originally introduced him to Naturmensch and Lebensreform.  In 1947\, at the prompting of Cowboy Jack Patton and Johnny Mercer\, ahbez approached Nat King Cole's manager backstage at the Lincoln Theater in Los Angeles\, handed him a tattered copy of "Nature Boy"\, and asked him to show it to Cole. However his pleas were ignored and a disappointed ahbez left the sheet music of "Nature Boy" with Cole's valet\, Otis Pollard. From him Cole came to know of the song and after reading it\, the singer loved it and began playing "Nature Boy" for live audiences to much acclaim. Irving Berlin\, who was present in the crowd\, had initially offered to buy the track from Cole. But he decided to record the track for himself and needed to get permission from ahbez before releasing it as a single. After ahbez was discovered living under the Hollywood Sign\, Cole got his permission and recorded the song COL channel name VAL nyronut	1

COL title VAL Misirlou COL performer VAL The Beach Boys	COL video title VAL Sonny & Cher - You Don't Love Me COL description VAL Sonny & Cher proved one of the magical musical combinations of the mid '60s and one of the better rock-influenced MOR acts of the early '70s\, their wisecracking repartee providing counterpoint to a series of adoring hit duets. Salvatore "Sonny" Bono (b. Feb. 16\, 1935) started out at Los Angeles-based Specialty Records as a songwriter in the late '50s\, responsible for "Koko Joe" by Don and Dewey and "She Said Yeah" for Larry Williams\, which was later covered by the Rolling Stones and the Righteous Brothers. Bono became a protégé of Phil Spector\, managing to write a handful of successful songs\, most notably "Needles and Pins" in collaboration with his protégé Jack Nitzsche\, which became a success for Jackie DeShannon and a huge international hit for the Searchers. In 1964\, while working sessions with Phil Spector\, he met an 18-year-old would-be singer named Cherilyn Lapierre (b. May 20\, 1946)\, and the two were later married. They formed a professional duet\, initially as Caesar and Cleo for Vault Records and later Reprise\, but it was only after they were signed to Atlantic Records as Sonny & Cher that success came their way. The couple embarked on parallel careers\, with Cher later signed to Liberty/Imperial Records as a solo act. She subsequently hit with "Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)" while Sonny charted with "Laugh at Me" on Atco\, but their biggest success was as a duet on Atco\, with "I Got You Babe" and "The Beat Goes On."  For a time\, from 1965 until 1967\, they were rock & roll's hottest couple\, so much so that in some conservative communities they were considered almost morally subversive; parents locked up their kids when Sonny and Cher were passing through for a concert appearance. They were popular enough\, and sufficiently well-known in their images that the Rolling Stones impersonated them on the British television music showcase Ready Steady Go\, miming to "I Got You Babe" with Brian Jones subbing for Sonny.  And then nothing -- the hits stopped coming\, and the couple made some daringly creative but unsuccessful commercial missteps\, even a movie (Good Times\, directed by William Friedkin in his debut) that was\, like the Monkees' Head\, too far ahead of its time for critics or all but the most advanced fans to appreciate. A further film effort\, Chastity\, a name shared by their daughter\, also bombed\, and the sudden confrontation of a $200\,000 income tax debt forced the couple to continue working. Further\, they were unable to record because of a dispute with Atlantic over Sonny's objections to the way that Cher's solo career was being handled.  They were playing supper clubs and Las Vegas nightclubs when Johnny Musso\, a friend of the couple's\, was jumping from an executive position at Atlantic to run Decca Records' Kapp label subsidiary\, and brought the duo with him. At around the same time\, their stage act -- which had evolved into a kind of "with it" domestic comedy routine nearly as prominent as the music\, with the tall\, wry-witted Cher cutting up on the seemingly dim-witted Sonny -- was spotted by Fred Silverman\, who was then the head of programming for CBS. They ended up with a summer replacement try-out show that did so well that Sonny & Cher were given a regular spot in the CBS lineup in January 1972 with a comedy-variety series.  The couple's recording career was revived initially by a live album cut in one night at Las Vegas\, featuring new versions of their early hits as well as parts of their current repertory; the album went gold. The first couple of singles by Cher and Sonny & Cher failed\, but then producer Snuff Garrett\, who had been at Liberty when Cher was there but had never worked with her\, was brought in\, and the result was "Gypsies\, Tramps and Thieves\," a career-reviving number one hit. After that\, "The Way of Love\," "All I Ever Need Is You" (which became the theme for their TV show)\, "A Cowboy's Work Is Never Done\," "Half Breed\," and "Dark Lady" kept either Cher or the couple in the Top Ten at various times through 1974. By then\, however\, their marriage had fallen apart\, and with it\, the success of their TV show. ~ Bruce Eder\, All Music Guide COL channel name VAL Sonny And Chers Channel	0

COL title VAL Lady Madonna COL performer VAL Fats Domino	COL video title VAL Patti Smith - Land: Horses\, Land of A Thousand Dances\, La Mer (De) COL description VAL This song\, from Patti's most famous album; Horses\, is a classic example of her music. Spoken-word poetry style lyrics underpinned by 3 chord rock embellished with complex & subtle instrumentals. Perfect.  None of this content belongs to me\, all respect and love to those it does. I have created this video from material belonging to others under fair use laws out of love and admiration for the musicians/film makers involved. The album was a huge influence on the New York punk scene (Not every punk band sounds like The Sex Pistols.) While most punk expounded a pragmatic ethos\, with simple instrumentals\, short songs\, simple lyrics\, deriving power through repetition like a protest\, Patti used complex arrangements and varied instrumental accompaniments and ambiguous lyrics. Anyway\, all that music history and theory bullshit aside\, this song rocks!  I made the video from The Tracey Fragments\, a film made by Bruce McDonald\, (starring Ellen Page) a slightly avant-garde Canadian director\, who made all the material for the film available to download and welcomed fans of his to edit the film into whatever they wanted. P.s Ellen is apparently a huge fan of Patti! COL channel name VAL andMaskellshrugged	0

A6 Chante A7 Rosbeef Attack B1 La Nuit Le Jour B2 Tout Est Fini B3 Tes Yeux B4 Tu Perds Ton Temps B5 Trop Sage B6 Debbie Merci B7 Froggies Strike Back!  ------------------------  "All Day and All of the Night" is a song by the British band The Kinks from 1964. It reached #2 on the UK Singles Chart and #7 on the United States Charts. Like their previous hit "You Really Got Me"\, the song relies on a simple sliding power chord riff\, although this song's riff is slightly more complicated\, incorporating a B Flat after the chords F and G. Otherwise\, the recordings are similar in beat and structure\, with similar background vocals\, progressions\, and guitar solos. In 2003 it appeared as #57 on Pure Pop's list of The 100 Best Singles of All. The guitar solo break by Dave Davies is truly inspired and difficult to copy\, and deemed to be so excellent that for many years it was claimed that Jimmy Page played the break - however\, it has been documented\, and confirmed by Ray Davies\, that Dave made up and played the solo himself\, accidentally augmenting the unique riff by playing it through an amp with a hole in it. Time.  Cover versions  The Stranglers made a cover in 1988\, reaching #7 in the UK singles charts. The Remains also did a cover of the song. It can be found on their album\, "A Session with The Remains". It was covered by Evermore on the single Light Surrounding You. Andy Timmons\, Paul Gilbert and Steve Vai covered it for the 90th Anniversary Ibanez concert. the Zodiacs (1965) Trooper (1979) Praying Mantis (1981) Skew Siskin (1992) Quiet Riot covered the song on their album "Down to the Bone" (1995) Cactus Jack (2002) Status Quo (17 November 2003) Flunk (2 May 2005) WaveGroup Sound (2007) Metallica covered the song at the Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame Anniversary Show with Ray Davies on vocals. The Adolescents covered this song on their live album\, Return To The Black Hole. Jessica Harp covered this song on the motion picture soundtrack "Shanghai Knights" The Brilliant Green\, featured on their 2010 single "Blue Daisy" 2 Live Crew\, parodied the song in track "One And One" in 1987's Move Somethin' Zwan covered the song in one of their latest live concerts.  Use in pop culture  "All Day and All of the Night" was featured in television advertisements for Starburst candy in 1998 and 1999.  The Wavegroup Sound cover of "All Day and All of the Night" is featured in the video game Guitar Hero: Aerosmith.  "All Day and All of the Night" is played in the video game Battlefield Vietnam.  "All Day and All of the Night" is played during the opening and closing credits of The Boat That Rocked and is also used in a trailer for the film.  It has been frequently noted as being very similar to the Doors song\, "Hello\, I Love You" (recorded four years later). Ray Davies was known to incorporate the lyrics into live performances.

En el verano de 1995\, se firmó un contrato con la Universal para tres álbumes\, por los que recibió una excelente crítica internacional. Por sus interpretaciones de "A Drum Is A Woman" en París y por co-protagonizar\, junto a Dee Dee Bridgewater\, Cabaret y Peace & Love\, Jeffery Smith fue venerado como uno de los mejores vocalistas de jazz masculino\, en la industria de hoy. En EE.UU. el debut de Jeffery llegó en 1998 con su auto-producido A Little Sweeter\, que contó con la brillantez del piano del genio Kenny Barron y su trío\, con Ray Drummond en el bajo y Ben Riley a la batería\, que ganó la aclamación de los críticos; la revista Times lo describió como "Uno de los álbumes más importantes del año". En 1999 continuó su exitosa carrera con su también auto-producida tercera grabación\, titulada Down Here Below\, destacándose en él la diva del jazz Dianne Reeves\, y el virtuoso violín de Regina Carter\, y que recibió elogios igualmente magníficos de revistas tales como Jazz Times\, Jazziz\, Down Beat y Vanity Fair COL channel name VAL gorrion1977	0

The first known published version of a "Frankie and Johnny" melody appeared in 1904 in the song "He Done Me Wrong (The Death Of Bill Bailey)"\, written by Hughie Cannon.  A variation on the melody\, with words and music by Frank and Bert Leighton\, appeared in 1908 under the title "Bill\, You Done Me Wrong". It was republished in 1912\, credited to the Leighton Brothers and Ren Shields\, as the more commonly recognizable "Frankie and Johnny".  The first known recording of Frankie and Johnny was in 1912\,  a vocal by Gene Greene accompanied by Charlie Straight on a very rare British Pathé 78 rpm disk.  The Leighton brothers recorded it for Victor in 1916 but it was never issued. Al Bernard made the first American recording for Brunswick in May of 1921\, followed a month later by this recording by Frank Crumit with the Biese Trio. In 1927\, Crumit recorded it again for Victor Records using different lyrics. COL channel name VAL bsgs98	0

The Creator / Macarthur Park first attempt  The first album Morgan recorded in Londons Pipe Studios (actually a TEAC 4-track recorder set up in his Notting Hill bedsit). This bizarre album was originally conceived (with the collusion of Iain McNay\, Cherry Reds boss) as a spoof compilation album featuring a variety of 'bands' from Peabody\, an obscure little town in Kansas (at that time American towns like Cleveland and Akron were viewed upon as hot-beds of modern rock music). When this concept was stated on the radio and in the press\, quite a number of people believed it! In truth\, it was all made by Morgan. The musical approach was to take songs and perform them in a way that was diametrically opposite to the original version. Here are the original artists who performed (or pre-formed) the songs\, and the styles adopted for these recordings:  1. Richard Harris in the style of The Specials or two-tone. 2. The Sex Pistols in the style of Pinky and Perky (a BBC TV childrens puppet show). 3. Kate Bush in the style of Jah Wobble and reggae/dub. 4. Perry Como in the style of The Sex Pistols and speed punk. 5. Peggy Lee - actually done in a contorted version of her own style. 6. The Brotherhood of Man in the style of Devo. 7. Rod Stewart in a new wave/techno style. 8. Sun Ra - actually an affectionate and slightly twisted version of his own style. 9. The Beatles collaged with a hint of "My Life In The Bush of Ghosts" (Eno/Byrne). 10. The Stranglers in the style of The Residents. 11. The Righteous Brothers in the style of Suicide. 12. Squeeze UK in the style of\, er\, The Residents meet Pink Floyd? Then a segue into Mott the Hoople in the style of an old 78rpm record by the Palm Court Orchestra. COL channel name VAL The Remould	0

The first known published version of a "Frankie and Johnny" melody appeared in 1904 in the song "He Done Me Wrong (The Death Of Bill Bailey)"\, written by Hughie Cannon.  A variation on the melody\, with words and music by Frank and Bert Leighton\, appeared in 1908 under the title "Bill\, You Done Me Wrong". It was republished in 1912\, credited to the Leighton Brothers and Ren Shields\, as the more commonly recognizable "Frankie and Johnny".  The first known recording of Frankie and Johnny was in 1912\,  a vocal by Gene Greene accompanied by Charlie Straight on a very rare British Pathé 78 rpm disk.  The Leighton brothers recorded it for Victor in 1916 but it was never issued. Al Bernard made the first American recording for Brunswick in May of 1921\, followed a month later by this recording by Frank Crumit with the Biese Trio. In 1927\, Crumit recorded it again for Victor Records using different lyrics. COL channel name VAL bsgs98	0

COL title VAL Don't Explain COL performer VAL Karel Boehlee Trio	COL video title VAL Robert Palmer - Don't Explain (Billie Holiday / Arthur Herzog's Cover) [Audio HQ] COL description VAL "Don't Explain" beautiful cover made it by Robert Palmer that you can find in his homonymous Lp of 1990. This song is surely one of the most amazing that he made on this album. Good Listening.  1990's  Don't  Explain  lp finds Robert Palmer in an ambitious  mood\, attempting  to highlight  both  his love of world  music and jazz standards  on an album  featuring  trademark  hard  rock. Essentially\, this 18  song collection comes across like three separate mini albums\, lacking a sense of cohesiveness when played as a whole\, a jarring juxtoposition of divergent musical styles instead of one record. However\, there are plenty of gems among the 18 tracks featured. Palmer showcases his love for African influenced melodies with the uptempo "Housework"\, complete with clever humorous lyrics\, and does a credible reggae version of Bob Dylan's "I'll Be Your Babt Tonight" with help from UB40 believe it or not. Actually\, that song was a major hit single in the UK!! The first third of the album is dominated by the rock material\, especially on the fast paced guitar driven metal songs "You're Mother Should Have Told You" and "Can't Get Enough Of A Good Thing". The highlight  is a rock  power ballad version of Otis Redding's "Dreams To Remember" where Palmer has to flex some vocal muscle and invoke some soul not present in the faster paced rock  songs. "You're Amazing" is a pleasant rocker (and a Top 40 US Hit Single)\, milder than the previous mentioned songs and similair to the singer's 1988 hit "Simply Irresistible"\, although not as good. The last third of this set sees the singer in full romance mode\, alternating between inspired original compositions such as "Aeroplane" and "Not A Word" and Palmer's own take of classic bits such as "You're So Desirable". The first two feature excellent string arrangements and show Palmer capable of conveying emotion vocally without being over the top while the latter plays to his vocal strengths with a more happy lyric and upbeat tempo. The title track is a Bille Holiday standard where Palmer's subtle\, understated vocals strongly convey the emotions of longing and pain expressed in the lyrics. In between it all is a unique medley of 2 Marvin Gaye hits\, "Mercy Mercy Me" and "I Want You"\, where the singer literally creates a whole new song\, using the pain and anguish over a world going bad from Gaye's powerful environmental ode as the bridge into a lyrical pleading for a chance at romance from Gaye's second number. Sticking with an arrangement culled largely from the first song\, the lyrics provide near perfect segue and Palmer raises the bar with some of his most powerful vocalizing in the song's second half. It's little wonder this song was a major hit single in both the US and UK\, arguably the best known song in this collection. Overall\, there are a good 12-14 songs in this set that would make a really good Robert Palmer record\, the problem here isn't that there isn't enough\, it's that there is a bit too much. Still a good buy\, with a lot of interesting material alongside some enjoyable guitar driven rock songs. In fact\, Palmer recruits Steve Stevens from Billy Idol's band to assist on some of the more edgy material\, an excellent choice. Robert Palmer fans will definately enjoy.

Lyrics:  Through early morning fog I see  Visions of the things to be  The pains that are withheld for me  I realize and I can see  That suicide is painless  It brings on many changes  And I can take or leave it if I please   The game of life is hard to play  I'm going to lose it anyway  The losing card I'll someday lay  So this is all I have to say   Suicide is painless  It brings on many changes  And I can take or leave it if I please   The sword of time will pierce our skins  It doesn't hurt when it begins  But as it works it's way on in  The pain grow stronger watch it grin   Suicide is painless  It brings on many changes  And I can take or leave it if I please   A brave man once requested me  To answer questions that are key  Is it to be or not to be  And I replied "Oh why ask me."   Suicide is painless  It brings on many changes  And I can take or leave it if I please   And you can do the same thing if you please. COL channel name VAL leendot	0

Welle: Erdball -- Ganz In Weiß  ------------------------  "Walk on the Wild Side" is a Lou Reed song from his 1972 second solo album Transformer. It was produced by David Bowie. The song received wide radio coverage\, despite its touching on taboo topics such as transsexuality\, drugs\, male prostitutes and oral sex and the term "colored" to refer to African Americans. In the United States\, RCA released an edited version of song as a single which eliminated the song's reference to oral sex.  It is usually regarded as Reed's best-known solo work. The song reached #16 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100\, and #10 in the UK. In 2003\, the song was ranked #221 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.  Covers  This song was covered by Company B\, on their album "Jam on Me." In February 1990\, two club/hiphop versions charted simultaneously in the UK - Jamie J. Morgan's cover produced by Richard Mazda reached #27\, whilst Beat System got to #63. In 1985\, 79-year old veteran German actress Gerty Molzen recorded her own version of the song\, cleaning up some of the lyrics in the process. She performed it on the David Letterman show in the US and on Gay Byrne's Late Late Show in Ireland. Echo & the Bunnymen usually merge this in concert with Nothing Lasts Forever. A 2005 song by artist RX featured George W. Bush "singing" a mixture of John Lennon's "Imagine" and the chorus from "Walk on the Wild Side". Irish/Australian comedian Jimeoin covered the song in 1993 on his music/comedy CD\, Goin' Off. The song featured the line "You should have seen them go go go\, I said G-O-G-G-O\, take a walk on the wildside" as a reference to the popular Yellow Pages ad on TV at the time. The Strokes and Robbie Williams played the full song or a snippet during their last tours. The band Sponge have been known to break into the song in the middle of playing their hit "Have You Seen Mary?" in live performances. The Rentals also play it live before transitioning into their hit "Friends of P". Train sings this song for the Bay Area's local station KFOG\, on a CD called Live From The Archives: Vol. 11\, as a part of the KFOG Kaboom Medley. A short part of the song was often used by Bono during performances of Bad in the mid eighties. Most notably performed at Live Aid in London. At a charity event\, Lou Reed played this song with comedians Conan O'Brien\, Jimmy Fallon\, Adam Sandler\, and Jack Black. Each person took on one verse of the song. Vanessa Paradis covered the song in her album Variations sur le même t'aime. Jesse Malin covered it on On Your Sleeve\, a cover album released in 2008. Young@Heart\, an entertainment group created by and for the elderly\, composed of people at least 70 years of age\, perform this song in concert. Moby includes the song in his concerts. During Exit Festival 2009\, he referred to it as "his favourite song about New York." Editors covered this song on 2007. Cover can be found on album Rhythms del Mundo Classics. Australian band Yves Klein Blue covered the song on the radio segment 'Like a Version' on Triple J in 2010 Trumpeter Rick Braun covered the song from 2005 album "Yours Truly." The German group Tok Tok Tok covers this song in their album "I wish" in 2005. The French group Pink Turtle gives this song a Jazz Age twist in their album "Reprise! When jazz meets pop #3" (2007).  Media Appearances  In a scene from the film Hedwig and the Angry Inch Hedwig starts singing it while in an oven. This song is usually the opening to Danny Masterson's LA radio show\, "Feel My Heat". Natalie Portman sings the line "And the colored girls go Doo\, doo\, doo\, doo\, doo\, doo\, doo\, doo" in the film Beautiful Girls. In the television show Medium\, the episode "Lady Killer" featured the tune of "Walk on the Wild side" (with no lyrics) during Patricia Arquette's character's dreams about a woman seducing men\, and perhaps gave a clue to who the actual killer was. The bassline of this song is used in the Gatorade G2 commercial. In the movie Guess Who this song is playing on the radio while Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher are driving in the car. In the film The Salton Sea an old man with a tracheotomy sings the song on a karaoke machine in a bar. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

COL title VAL Alright Now COL performer VAL Abi Wallenstein	COL video title VAL George Barnes -- Adios COL description VAL George Barnes era uno de los guitarristas más prolíficos y versátiles de los años cincuenta y sesenta. Aunque\, básicamente era un hombre de jazz\, era un maestro de todos los estilos: blues\, country\, folk\, pop\, R & R\, R & B. Fue uno de los primeros en grabar con la guitarra eléctrica y Chet Atkins\, Les Paul y Charlie Christian le han citado como una fuente de inspiración principal.  A la edad de 14 años\, Barnes ya era un músico profesional y  había formado su propio cuarteto George Barnes. Dos años más tarde grabó sus primeros discos consu propio nombre: "I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles" and "I Can't Believe That You're In Love With Me" para el sello Okeh. En 1938 estaba trabajando para la NBC\, como director de orquesta\, guitarrista y arreglista. Tras su paso por el ejército durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial\, Barnes volvió a su trabajo de estudio y grabó transcripciones de radio con su octeto inusual.  En 1951 se trasladó de Chicago a Nueva York\, donde de inmediato consiguió un contrato con Decca para grabar sus propios álbumes. George también se reunió con Carl Kress en 1951\, el comienzo de una amistad que iba a dar lugar a una  formación aclamada por la crítica. Recorrieron el mundo juntos e hicieron algunas de las mejores grabaciones de dúos de guitarra de la historia.  En este tiempo\, George tenía  la Guild Guitar Company dedicada a construir una guitarra única bajo sus especificaciones. Tras la muerte de Kress en 1965\, la  próxima pareja de George iba a ser Bucky Pizzarelli. Como músico de estudio\, Barnes ha trabajado con todos\, desde Louis Armstrong a Bob Dylan.  iTunes: http://itunes.apple.com/es/album/guitar-galaxies/id476374761  Síguenos en: Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/vintagem.es Spotify: http://open.spotify.com/user/vintagemusic Web: http://www.vintagemusic.es BoutiqAlia: http://boutiqalia.com/store/vintage/ (compra física de CD) Compra nuestros Cd's en formato físico en estas plataformas: Ebay:  http://stores.ebay.com/VintageMusicFm BoutiqAlia: www.boutiqalia-vintagemusic.com Síguenos en: Spotify: https://goo.gl/raouHQ Facebook: https://goo.gl/L92BHL Instagram: https://goo.gl/3oYDGH Web: http://www.vintagemusic.es   Compra nuestros Cd's en formato físico en estas plataformas: Ebay:  http://stores.ebay.com/VintageMusicFm BoutiqAlia: www.boutiqalia-vintagemusic.com Discogs: https://www.discogs.com/es/seller/vintagemusicfm/profile COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm	0

COL title VAL The Dark End of the Street COL performer VAL Veronica Klaus	COL video title VAL Lenny Dee - His Organ and Orchestra -  For Once in my Life COL description VAL " Life is like a beautiful melody\, only the lyrics are messed up ."  ―---- Hans Christian Andersen  Lenny Dee Leonard George DeStoppelaire (January 5\, 1923 -- February 12\, 2006)\, better known as Lenny Dee\, was a virtuoso organist who played many styles of music. His record albums were among the most popular of easy listening and space age pop organists of the 1950s through the early 1970s. His signature hit\, Plantation Boogie\, charted as a Top 20 hit in 1955. He also had a gold record with 1970's Spinning Wheel. Dee played a variety of songs in numerous styles. He played original compositions\, popular songs\, and novelty tunes\, and was a master of improvisation. Although his unique style was a pop/boogie-woogie blend\, he also played ballads\, country and western\, jazz\, rock\, and patriotic songs. As a child\, he sang in his church's choir; he also played ukulele and accordion. As a teenager\, he turned playing the accordion into a profession\, which he continued until he was drafted into the Navy during World War II in 1943. Upon his return from service\, Dee spent his Navy earnings on a Hammond Model A organ\, one of the earliest of its kind. With money from the G.I. Bill\, he received instruction in organ at the Chicago Conservatory of Music. Afterward\, he began playing hotels and night clubs in the south in the late 1940s to some degree of success\, but very little fame and no record contracts. It was not until the early 1950s that Dee was signed up to Decca after country singer Red Foley heard him playing at the Plantation Inn in Nashville\, Tennessee\, and thought Dee's country flavor would be a good contrast to the label's then prominent organist\, Ethel Smith. Dee made good\, and his original composition\, Plantation Boogie charted at #18 in 1955. Dee re-recorded the hit on numerous albums\, and was often imitated\, even plagiarized\, but never duplicated. Dee ventured into recording albums for Decca starting in 1954 with his first LP\, Dee-lightful. Part of Dee's charm was his albums' zany covers featuring Dee in various situations\, and titles with puns that usually included his name\, such as Dee-Lirious\, Dee-Licious\, and Dee-Most! His recording featured organ with other instruments. He was nearly always backed by percussion; depending on the song\, he also recorded with guitar; bass; a backup chorus; strings; horns such as saxophones\, trombones\, trumpets; and even the banjo.  Dee continued recording into the 1970s\, adding a background orchestra in the late '60s as many other easy listening performers were doing at the time. By the late 1970s\, Dee was in less demand. After recording 56 albums\, he was finally dropped from the MCA label\, along with many other easy listening artists. Dee spent the rest of his career at his night clubs and on tour\, but the demand for his music continued to decline. In 1999\, Dee played on a series of cruise ship tours. He retired in 2003. He died on February 12\, 2006 in St. Petersburg.  For Once In My Life "For Once in My Life" is a swing song written by Ron Miller and Orlando Murden for Motown Records' Jobete publishing company in 1967.   The composition was originally recorded by Jean DuShon\, while other artists\, such as Tony Bennett and The Temptations\, recorded slow ballad versions of the song. Jack Soo was the first male artist to record a version of the song—it never made it to any public market and the recording was permanently shelved in the Motown Records archives.  The most familiar and successful version of "For Once in My Life" is an uptempo arrangement by Stevie Wonder\, recorded immediately after DuShon's original.   Wonder's version (issued on Motown's Tamla label) was a top-three hit in the United States in late 1968 and early 1969. Remarkably\, the song became one of the most covered songs of all time (it's estimated that by now some 300 different versions have been recorded) - it also became part of popular culture because it appeared in many films and television programs\, as well as in commercials.  MHO Arranger Bill Mc Enhiley wrote this fabulous up-tempo arrangement for Lenny and "Mr Dee" is clearly enjoying himself when he plays this well known Stevie Wonder hit. The supporting orchestra is in good shape as well and provides the ideal background for Lenny as he delivers some great improvisation here and there.  Hearing this\, it will not come as surprise to you that Lenny Dee was one of the most successful artists in the field of easy listening\, and especially in the hammond organ branche.  From the 1969 album "Little Green Apples" here's Lenny Dee & His Orchestra with "For Once in my Life". ENJOY !

Márcio Greyck apresentou um programa chamado "O Mundo é dos Jovens"\, na extinta TV Tupi de São Paulo\, ao lado da cantora Sandra\, em 1967. Nessa época\, Roberto Carlos apresentava o programa "Jovem Guarda" na TV Record\, exibido de 1965 a 1968. Revista ROLLING STONE\, Outubro de 2008\, pag 158 : "No ano em que o mundo comemora as 40 primaveras do White Album\, lançado em 1968\, o Brasil acaba de dar à luz uma versão também democrática do disco duplo dos Beatles. No original\, pela primeira vez\, Paul\, John e George abriram espaço para Ringo colocar uma música sua no repertório\, e\, como instrumentistas\, cada um teve a chance de se mostrar individualmente. No Álbum Branco produzido pelo jornalista e pesquisador Marcelo Fróes\, os 30 convidados imprimiram seu estilo às músicas. Zé Ramalho canta "Dear Prudence" na velha conhecida "atmosfera mística"\, enquanto Daniel Tendler\, com timbre grave e vocal cuidadoso\, transforma "The Continuing Story Of Bungalow Bill" em canção para ninar gente grande. Pato Fu fez "Birthday" com cara de... Pato Fu. "I Will"\, com Érika Martins\, virou um delicioso folk\, enquanto "Julia" fez as vezes de bossa nova na voz e no violão de Celso Fonseca. Grande surpresa é a versão de Márcio Greyck para "Martha My Dear": com voz dobrada\, o músico faz bela interpretação da canção de Lennon e McCartney." (..)

COL title VAL Where Have All the Flowers Gone COL performer VAL Pete Seeger	COL video title VAL Lillian Roth -- Let's Fall in Love COL description VAL Lillian Roth (13 de diciembre de 1910 — 12 de mayo de 1980) fue una actriz y cantante estadounidense.  Nacida en Boston\, Massachusetts\, tenía únicamente seis años de edad cuando su madre la llevó a Educational Pictures\, donde pasó a ser la imagen de la compañía\, simbolizada por una estatua viviente sosteniendo la lámpara del conocimiento. Al año siguiente debutó como actriz teatral en el circuito de Broadway actuando en The Inner Man. Su primera actuación cinematográfica llegó en 1918 con Pershing's Crusaders. Junto a su hermana Ann actuaban de manera itinerante bajo el nombre de "Lillian Roth and Co\," y a veces las dos eran llamadas "The Roth Kids". Uno de los momentos más emocionantes de ambas hermanas llegó cuando conocieron al Presidente de los Estados Unidos Woodrow Wilson\, cuando éste llevó a las dos a dar la vuelta a la manzana en su coche tras asistir al número de vodevil de ambas. Roth entró en la Clark School of Concentration en los inicios de la década de 1920\, actuó en Artists and Models en 1923 y trabajó en Revels con Frank Fay.  En 1927\, cuando Roth tenía 17 años de edad\, trabajó en la primera de tres Earl Carroll Vanities\, a las cuales pronto siguieron las Midnight Frolics\, una producción de Florenz Ziegfeld. Pronto la joven actriz firmó un contrato de siete años con Paramount Pictures. Entre los filmes que rodó para Paramount figuran El desfile del amor (1929\, con Maurice Chevalier)\, The Vagabond King (1930)\, Paramount on Parade (1930)\, Honey (1930\, en el cual cantaba "Sing\, You Sinners")\, Madam Satan (1930\, de Cecil B. DeMille\, con Reginald Denny y Kay Johnson\, Sea Legs (con Jack Oakie)\, y la segunda película de los Hermanos Marx\, El conflicto de los Marx (1930). Roth hizo para el cine el papel que Ethel Merman había interpretado en la obra teatral Take a Chance\, y cantó "Eadie Was a Lady". Tras dejar Paramount hizo un papel de reparto en el film carcelario femenino Ladies They Talk About (Warner Brothers\, 1933)\, junto a Barbara Stanwyck.  Además\, fue cabeza de cartel del Teatro Palace de Nueva York\, actuando en Earl Carroll Vanities en 1928\, 1931 y 1932\, haciendo grandes progresos en su faceta de cantante. Desafortunadamente\, la vida personal de Roth cada vez se veía más ensombrecida por su adicción al alcohol. Roth estuvo fuera del candelero desde finales de la década de 1930 hasta 1953\, cuando actuó en un episodio especial de la serie televisiva This Is Your Life\, con Ralph Edwards. En respuesta a su sinceridad al relatar su historia de alcoholismo\, Roth recibió más de cuarenta mil cartas. En 1962 encarnó a la madre de Elliott Gould en el musical I Can Get It for You Wholesale\, producción en la cual hacía su debut en Broadway Barbra Streisand. A pesar de la gran acogida conseguida por Streisand\, el productor David Merrick observó que el nombre de Roth todavía vendía entradas\, por lo que tras el estreno puso su nombre por encima del de Gould\, Streisand y Sheree North. Roth permaneció en el show durante todas las representaciones\, un total de 301\, y grabó un disco relativo a la obra para Columbia Records.  Roth se casó al menos cinco veces. Sus maridos fueron el aviador William C. Scott ("Willie Richards")\, el juez Benjamin Shalleck\, Eugene J. Weiner ("Mark Harris")\, Edward Goldman ("Vic")\, y Burt McGuire. Antes de su primera boda había tenido una relación con David Lyons\, fallecido de tuberculosis. En mayo de 1932 se divorció de W. C. Scott\, tras trece meses de matrimonio. En 1955 conoció a Thomas Burt McGuire\, ligado a la editora Funk and Wagnalls Publishing Company\, en una reunión de Alcohólicos Anónimos\, grupo en el cual Roth formaba parte desde 1946. .  Roth falleció a causa de un ictus en 1980 en Nueva York. Tenía 69 años de edad. Fue enterrada en el Cementerio Mount Pleasant del Condado de Westchester\, Nueva York.

And Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot Fighting in the captain's tower While calypso singers laugh at them And fishermen hold flowers Between the windows of the sea Where lovely mermaids flow And nobody has to think too much About Desolation Row  Yes\, I received your letter yesterday (About the time the doorknob broke) When you asked how I was doing Was that some kind of joke?

The standard\, "Chloe\," was written in 1927 and recorded over the years by many well-known recording artists\, including the Paul Whiteman Orchestra in 1928 and Louis Armstrong in 1953. I especially like this interpretation by the Henry Allen Orchestra. On the reverse side of the record is "You're Not the Kind\," presented earlier here.  "Through the black of night\, I've got to go where you are. If it's wrong or right\, I've got to go where you are!  "I'll roam through the dismal swamp land Searching for you; 'Cause if you are lost there\, Let me be there\, too!  "Through the smoke and flames\, I've got to go where you are; For no place could be too far\, Where you are!  "Ain't no chains can bind you; If you live\, I'll find you. Love is calling me; I've got to go where you are!"  The swamp land pictorial interlude includes illustrations from vintage magazines in the collection of abendstunde49.

COL title VAL Hey\, That's No Way to Say Goodbye COL performer VAL The Decemberists	COL video title VAL GLORIA JONES get it on part 2 (1976) COL description VAL album : Vixen produced by Marc Bolan  When the name of Gloria Jones comes up in rock talk\, it's usually as a trivia question. Firstly\, in the mid-'60s she recorded the original version of "Tainted Love\," which was covered by Soft Cell for a huge international hit in 1982. She was also the girlfriend of British glam rocker Marc Bolan\, in addition to singing and playing keyboards in his T. Rex band. Her considerable talent as a soul singer gets lost in the shuffle\, especially because few of her recordings are currently available. Jones earns a spot in rock history on the merits of "Tainted Love" alone. This propulsive mid-'60s soul stomper\, wholly dissimilar to Soft Cell's wimpy synth pop cover\, is one of the great '60s hits that never was. "Heartbeat" was another throbbing near-miss\, recorded with\, oddly enough\, producer Ed Cobb\, who was more renowned for his work with garage-pop groups like the Standells and the Chocolate Watch Band. Both "Heartbeat" and "Tainted Love" were written by Cobb as well\, although Jones was not without songwriting talent\, co-writing Marvin Gaye and Diana Ross' 1974 hit duet\, "My Mistake." Jones never had more than regional success\, and (like several other minor American soul singers) moved to Great Britain\, where the cultish devotion of Northern Soul fans ensured regular work. In 1974\, Jones joined T. Rex (which by that time was fading rapidly) as a keyboardist and backing vocalist. Becoming romantically involved with the singer\, she also helped sway him into a more soul/dance-oriented direction. Bolan in turn helped her out on her solo album Vixen\, playing guitar and writing songs. After having a child\, their time together came to a tragic end when Bolan was killed in a car accident in 1977\, with Jones at the wheel. COL channel name VAL OubaelPhoumet	0

All good people read good books Now your conscience is clear I hear you talk girl Now your conscience is clear.  Look my eyes are just holograms Look your love has drawn red from my hands From my hands you know you'll never be More than twist in my sobriety.  We've just poked a little empty pie For the fun that people had at night. Late at night don't need hostility The timid smile and pause to free.  I don't care about their different thoughts Different thoughts are good for me. Up in arms and chaste and whole All God's children took their toll.  Look my eyes are just holograms Look your love has drawn red from my hands From my hands you know you'll never be More than twist in my sobriety More than twist in my sobriety.  Cup of tea\, take time to think\, yeah Time to risk a life\, a life\, a life Sweet and handsome Soft and porky You peg out 'til you've seen the light\, Peg out 'til you've seen the light.  Half the people read the papers Read them good and well. Pretty people\, nervous people\, People have got to sell News you have to sell.  Look my eyes are just holograms Look your love has drawn red from my hands From my hands you know you'll never be More than twist in my sobriety More than twist in my sobriety More than twist in my sobriety More than twist in my sobriety.

But I won't cry for yesterday there's an ordinary world Somehow I have to find And as I try to make my way to the ordinary world I will learn to survive  Papers in the roadside tell of suffering and greed Here today\, forgot tomorrow Here besides the news of holy war and holy need Ours is just a little sorrowed talk What has happened to the world? Crazy some'd say Where is my friend when I need you most?  But I won't cry for yesterday there's an ordinary world Somehow I have to find And as I try to make my way to the ordinary world I will learn to survive  Any world is my world Any world is my world Any world is my world Every world is my world COL channel name VAL SaybiaFTW	0

The first known published version of a "Frankie and Johnny" melody appeared in 1904 in the song "He Done Me Wrong (The Death Of Bill Bailey)"\, written by Hughie Cannon.  A variation on the melody\, with words and music by Frank and Bert Leighton\, appeared in 1908 under the title "Bill\, You Done Me Wrong". It was republished in 1912\, credited to the Leighton Brothers and Ren Shields\, as the more commonly recognizable "Frankie and Johnny".  The first known recording of Frankie and Johnny was in 1912\,  a vocal by Gene Greene accompanied by Charlie Straight on a very rare British Pathé 78 rpm disk.  The Leighton brothers recorded it for Victor in 1916 but it was never issued. Al Bernard made the first American recording for Brunswick in May of 1921\, followed a month later by this recording by Frank Crumit with the Biese Trio. In 1927\, Crumit recorded it again for Victor Records using different lyrics. COL channel name VAL bsgs98	0

COL title VAL Dancing on the Ceiling COL performer VAL Enoch Light and The Light Brigade	COL video title VAL Tommy Dorsey -  "Oh Look At Me Now"  -  vocals - Frank Sinatra\,Connie Haines\, & The Pied Pipers COL description VAL "Oh! Look at Me Now" is a 1941 song composed by Joe Bushkin\, with lyrics by John DeVries. It is strongly associated with Frank Sinatra\, who first recorded it with Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra\, in an arrangement by Sy Oliver. Sinatra re-recorded the song in 1957 for the album A Swingin' Affair\, this time conducted by Nelson Riddle.  Frank Sinatra - with Tommy Dorsey\, Connie Haines and The Pied Pipers\, January 6\, 1941\, A Swingin' Affair! (1957)\, Sinatra 57 in Concert (1999)  Connie Haines died in September 2008 Obit... September 26\, 2008  Connie Haines\, a petite and dynamic big band singer who performed alongside Frank Sinatra in the Harry James and Tommy Dorsey orchestras\, died Monday in Clearwater\, Fla. The cause of death was myasthenia gravis\, an autoimmune neuromuscular disease. She was 87.  Haines was best known as a singer with a knack for rhythm\, and many of her most successful recordings -- 25 of which each sold more than 50\,000 copies -- featured her crisp\, swinging vocal style.   When Dorsey first heard her in action with James at Frank Dailey's Meadowbrook\, New Jersey's temple of big band music\, he reportedly asked\, "Hey\, little girl\, where'd you learn to swing like that? And when can you join my band?"  It didn't take long. Haines recorded "Comes Love" and "I Can't Afford to Dream" with James\, revealing a capacity to handle lyrical ballads as well as jitterbug specials\, before moving to the Dorsey organization with Sinatra.  James\, however\, was not fond of Haines' birth name -- Yvonne Marie Antoinette JaMais -- suggesting that it would take up too much space on a theater marquee. "You don't look like an Yvonne\," he said\, "you look like a Connie." And "Haines" was chosen\, apparently because it was a close rhyme to "James."  Haines quickly made the name her own\, however\, establishing herself as one of the prime female singers of the big band era. Many of her hit songs were the product of a warm musical partnership with Sinatra via tunes such as "Oh\, Look At Me Now\," "Let's Get Away From It All\," "Friendship\," "I'll Never Smile Again" and the jaunty rhythm tune "Snooty Little Cutie."  Like many big band vocalists of the '40s\, Haines moved on to a solo career as the public's preferences turned away from large ensemble swing to singers. Over the course of the next few decades\, she released more than 200 recordings\, ranging from her big band stylings to more contemporary rhythms.  The first white singer to record for Motown Records\, she released 14 songs written by Smokey Robinson\, including "What's Easy For Two Is Hard For One."  Haines also was drawn to gospel music as a reflection of her Christian beliefs\, recording and touring in an ensemble that included close friends Beryl Davis\, Rhonda Fleming and Jane Russell.  Although her career as an actress tended to be framed in films that allowed her to perform as a singer\, Haines' appearances in motion pictures such as "The Duchess of Idaho" suggested a talent that never had the opportunity to fully blossom within her lifelong dedication to music.  She was a regular on the Abbott & Costello Radio Show and a frequent guest artist during the golden years of television variety shows\, appearing with Milton Berle\, Eddie Cantor\, Perry Como\, Frankie Laine and Ed Sullivan\, among others.  Haines' marriage to Robert DeHaven\, an ace pilot during World War II\, ended in divorce.  She is survived by her mother\, Mildred JaMais\, who is 109; a son\, Robert DeHaven Jr. of San Francisco; a daughter\, Kimberly Harlan of Prineville\, Ore.; and three grandchildren."

The musical contained more great songs Shirley Bassey has also performed: "The Lady Is A Tramp"\, "Where Or When" and "My Funny Valentine".  The 'Babes In Arms' story is about a group of vaudevillians who want to revive their old fashioned form of entertainement by doing a roadshow. "Johnny One Note" is sung as a bedtimestory. A kind of fairy tale about a very ego-centred singer who is so very loud that nobody can hear the soprano. This lady singer asks her godmother to put a spell on Johnny\, so that the next time he wants to impress everybody by holding his note as long as possible he has to held it forever.  Shirley Bassey wrote about "Johnny One Note":   I don't always recognize the right songs for me the first time I hear them. For a long time I was asked to do 'Johnny One Note'\, but I couldn't do it for many\, many years. Then one day Eddie Fisher's musical director just sat at the piano and said\, 'This is a good song for you'\, and started playing 'Johnny One Note'. The way he played it\, I got so excited\, but I said 'I can't do this song'. 'Why not?' he asked. 'Well\, when I was discovered\, the girl whose place I took in the show\, she had a big hit with this song and I've never been able to touch this song.' 'Well\, try it\,' he said. And I was amazed when I opened my mouth: this voice came out singing this song as though it was mine. So\, after all those years - it was about ten years\, I believe - when we actually got down to it\, it was a piece of cake.  LYRICS: Johnny could only sing one note  And the note he sang was this: aaaahh  Poor Johnny One Note  Sang out with Gusto A nd just overloaded the place Poor Johnny One Note  Yelled willy-nilly  Until he was blue in the face For holding one note was his ace  Couldn't hear the brass  Couldn't hear the drum He was in a class  By himself\, by gum Poor Johnny One Note  Got in Aida indeed a great chance to be brave He took his one note  Howled like the North Wind  Brought forth wind that made critics rave While Verdi turned round in his grave  Couldn't hear the flute  Or the big trombone Everyone was mute  Johnny stood alone Cats and dogs stopped yapping  Lions in the zoo  Were all jealous of Johnny's big thrill Thunderclaps stopped clapping  Traffic ceased its roar  And they tell us Niag'ra stood still He stopped the trainwistles  Boatwhistles  Steamwhistles  Copwhistles All whistles bowed to his skill  Sing Johnny One Note Sing out with gusto  And just overwhelm all the crowd  Aaaahh   So sing\, Johnny One Note out loud  Sing\, Johnny One Note  Sing -  Johnny -  One Note -  Out loud  ABOUT the LP\, I've Got A Song For You: I've Got a Song for You is a 1966 album by Shirley Bassey. Bassey had left EMI's Columbia Label\, and this was her first album for United Artists\, a label she would remain with for approximately 14 years. This album and the following release And We Were Lovers were produced by Bassey's former husband\, Kenneth Hume. (Their marriage had ended in divorce in 1965\, but he continued to act as her manager\, and for these two albums\, her producer.) The album entered the UK Albums Chart at #26\, but only remained on the chart for one week\, and failed to chart in the US\, despite her having received outstanding reviews for live engagements in New York and Las Vegas that same year\, and the fact that the album was recorded in New York.

"iron Man" is available on 7" vinyl: http://shop.tapeterecords.com/hellsongs-iron-man-7-vinyl.html  HELLSONGS about "Iron Man":  "Iron Man must be one of the first guitar riffs I tried to copy on guitar. Easy but yet doomy and totally cool in the way that you just want to play it over and over again. This was probably one of the roughest songs ever to wrestle down for Hellsongs and there are many x-rated versions in the secret drawer. This since our idea never have been to just copy the original straight away.  Thanks to Johan Reivén\, one of the producers\, I kept throwing and re-building and I´m very happy that we all had the patience to let it grow. Hellsongs have never before released such a monstrous track\, always keeping it quite gentle and lo-fi. Well\, this new approach is more or less the red line this time\, not bothering about how we have done things in the past. This track needed drums\, bass and a whole lot more - so be it!  The video was shot in a very cosy but almost never used public space in Majorna\, Göteborg. The actors are friends and neighbours of Hellbender thus the finest beings alive. It was a true pleasure to watch them perform and work together with the talented video team. The director called us up late 2012\, stating that he wanted to do a video with Hellsongs. It´s always very fun and interesting when someone chases us\, instead of the opposite. Usually they are nutcases but Ronn Elfors Lipsker is quite the opposite\, which this video clearly shows.  His strong idea was to use a metal gimmick of some kind (it turned out to be the Kiss make up) to show how identity can be based in a music genre. In my own case\, metal was a big core of my self confidence and self esteem when I grew up. It made me strong enough to cope with some really tough situations. As I grew up\, that has been more and more internalized and I do not longer have the need to show that I´m a metal head to keep my cool up. We had great fun doing the video and I really think the actors are great\, especially if you consider the age of the youngsters!  The funniest part was that we hadn´t found any oldtimers until the day we finally shot the video. There was this gang of the local skid row\, hanging out in the park while we were shooting the last parts\, so I asked the director if he felt ok working with some of them. He was totally cool with it\, so I just walked up to them and succeded with convincing them to be a part of the video. After a while they hooked up with us and oh boy\, you could easily tell how much they enjoyed that!  http://www.tapeterecords.de/artists/hellsongs/ http://www.hellsongs.com/ COL channel name VAL Tapete Records	0
COL title VAL Island in the Sun COL performer VAL Belafonte	COL video title VAL Frank C. Stanley & Corinne Morgan - The Mocking Bird 1904 COL description VAL Victor 4080 - Frank C. Stanley & Corinne Morgan - The Mocking Bird 1904 - Music & Lyrics by Septimus Winner.  Frank C. Stanley (29 December 1868 -- 12 December 1910) was a bass-baritone singer\, stage performer and banjoist who made many early gramophone recordings on disc and cylinder during the 1890s and the 1900s. His real name was William Stanley Grinsted. He was born on 29 December 1868 in Orange\, New Jersey. From 1891 onwards he made banjo recordings for the Edison Phonograph Company under his own name. When he started to make vocal recordings\, he did that under the Frank Stanley pseudonym. In the early 1900s he organized the Columbia Quartet\, and in 1906 it was renamed the Peerless Quartet when it started to record for companies other than Columbia. He died of pleurisy on 12 December 1910 at his home in Orange.  Corinne Morgan (16 February 1876 -- 1945?) was the stage name of Corinne (or Cora) Welsh. She was a contralto singer and pioneer recording artist who recorded popular songs in the early years of the twentieth century and was best known for her duets with Frank Stanley. Some sources misspell her name as Corrine. She was born at Commercial Point\, Ohio\, the daughter of John C. Welsh\, a farmer\, and later moved to New York City. In 1902\, she started recording for the major cylinder recording companies of the day\, including Edison and Columbia\, although after 1904 most of her recordings were for Victor Records. She was one of the first female singers to record regularly\, and mainly recorded sentimental rather than comic songs. She does not seem to have recorded after 1909\, but worked as a professional singer until at least 1919. Most sources give her year of death as 1945\, although a date in 1942 has also been suggested.

COL title VAL Folsom Prison Blues COL performer VAL Ryan Sheridan	COL video title VAL Lainie Kazan Tribute COL description VAL Here is a great song by a great lady of show business. Lainie Kazan (born Lainie Levine in 1940 in New York City) is an American actress and singer. Born to an Ashkenazic Jewish father and a Sephardic Jewish mother\, Kazan began her Broadway career as understudy to Barbra Streisand in "Funny Girl"\, finally getting to go on eighteen months into the run when the star was felled by a serious throat problem. Coincidentally\, both had attended the same high school\, Erasmus High School in Brooklyn\, New York. Kazan's mother alerted the press and\, encouraged by rave reviews for her performance\, she quit the show and set out to establish herself in a singing career. She appeared in numerous supper clubs across the country\, and guested on Dean Martin's variety series twenty-six times. Other television work includes recurring roles on the sitcom "The Nanny" and on "Veronica's Closet"\, and guest shots on "St. Elsewhere" (resulting in an Emmy nomination)\, "The Paper Chase"\, "Touched by an Angel" (with Della Reese)\, and "Will & Grace".  Kazan returned to Broadway to recreate her film role for the musical adaptation of "My Favorite Year"\, earning a Tony Award nomination for her performance. She has also appeared in regional productions of "A Little Night Music"\, "Man of La Mancha"\, "Gypsy"\, "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"\, "Hello Dolly!"\, and "Fiddler on the Roof"\, among others. Kazan's feature films include Francis Ford Coppola's "One from the Heart"\, "My Favorite Year" (both in 1982)\, "Lust in the Dust" (1985)\, "Harry and the Hendersons" (1987)\, "Beaches" (1988)\, "The Cemetery Club" (1993)\, "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" (2002)\, "Gigli" (2003)\, "Red Riding Hood" (2004)\, "Whiskey School" (2005). In recent years\, Kazan has kept busy performing on concert stages and in Las Vegas and Atlantic City showrooms. Kazan posed for a spread in Playboy magazine that appeared in the October\, 1970\, issue\, an interesting departure from the magazine's usual norm of ultra-slender women. Kazan's Playboy spread inspired Jack Kirby to create the DC Comics superheroine Big Barda. Listen to Lainie's big and sunny voice and enjoy! COL channel name VAL johnxxx20000	0

The tune can also be heard on Side-1 of 1974's Sammi's Greatest Hits\, a LP released by the Mega Records Label.  With Pen in Hand  With pen in hand you signed your name Today at five I'll be on that train And you'll be free and I will be alone\, oh so alone If you think we can't find the love we once knew If you think I can't make everything up to you Then I'll be gone and you'll be on your own You'll be on your own  Can you take good care of Jenny Can you take her to school everyday Can you teach her how to play all the games that little girls play Now hear what I say  Can you teach her how to roll up her hair Can you make sure each night she says her prayers If you can do all these things well then maybe she won't miss me Maybe she won't miss me  And tonight as you lay in that big lonely bed Can you look at the pillow where I laid my head With your heart on fire will you have no desire  To hold me and to kiss me And if you can forget the good times we had If you don't think our good times outweigh the bad Well\, then sign your name and I'll be on my way Yes\, I'll be on my way  It was written by Bobby Goldsboro.

COL title VAL Nature Boy COL performer VAL Bobby Scott and His Trio	COL video title VAL Someone To Watch Over Me By Enoch Light COL description VAL Enoch Light was a classical violinist\, bandleader\, and recording engineer who was a pioneer of early stereo excellence.  He would go to extreme lengths to create high-quality recordings that took full advantage of current state of the art equipment.  He pioneered stereo effects that bounced the sounds between the right and left channels (often described as "ping-pong").  He arranged his musicians in ways to produce the kinds of recorded sounds he wished to achieve\, the first to do so.   His ensemble of studio musicians was frequently referred to as The Light Brigade.  The first of the his albums\, Persuasive Percussion\, became the first huge hit based solely on record sales.  His songs received little or no airplay on the radio\, because AM radio\, the standard of the day\, was monaural.  He released several albums in the Persuasive Percussion series\, as well as a Command test record.  He doubled the size of his album sleeves but enabled it to fold like a book\, thus inventing the gatefold-packaging format.   The gatefold sleeve became extremely popular in later decades\, and was used on albums such as The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  He pioneered many recording techniques such as the use of 35 mm film soundtrack instead of magnetic tape.  Recording on 35 mm film soundtrack reduced the effects of "wow" and "flutter"\, common in early stereo recordings.   The recordings were released under the "35MM" series\, starting from "Stereo 35-MM" released by Command Records.   Musicians who appeared on his albums include Doc Severinsen\, Tony Mottola\, Dick Hyman\, and arranger Lew Davies.    In 1965\, he sold the Command record label to ABC\, who began using the label for their lesser quality releases.  He continued recording after the sale of Command with a new label called Project 3\, but did not concentrate so heavily on stereo effects.  Enoch Light And The Light Brigade\, using the original scores\, released albums of the hits of the big band era\, keeping the arrangements as close to the original as possible.

Via della povertà    (versione LIVE eseguita a Viareggio nei primi anni "80)   Il Salone di bellezza in fondo al vicolo  è affollatissimo di marinai  prova a chiedere a uno che ore sono  e ti risponderà "non l'ho saputo mai".  Le cartoline dell'impiccagione  sono in vendita a cento lire l'una  il commissario cieco dietro la stazione  per un indizio ti legge la sfortuna  e le forze dell'ordine irrequiete  cercano qualcosa che non va  mentre io e la mia signora ci affacciamo stasera su via della Povertà. Signorile sembra così facile  ogni volta che sorride ti cattura  ricorda proprio Bette Davis  con le mani appoggiate alla cintura.  Arriva Lombardi trafelato  e le grida "la sinistra sei tu!"  ma qualcuno gli dice di andar via  perché ormai non esiste piu' e l'unico suono che rimane  quando l'ambulanza se ne va  è Signorile che spazza la strada  in via della Povertà. Mentre l'alba sta uccidendo la luna  e le stelle si son quasi nascoste  la signora che legge la fortuna  se n'è andata in compagnia dell'oste.  Ad eccezione di Abele e di Caino  tutti quanti sono andati a far l'amore  aspettando che venga la pioggia  ad annacquare la gioia ed il dolore  e il Cardinal Marcinkus sta affilando la sua pietà  se ne andrà a far la questua stasera  in via della Povertà. Al Quirinale sono disperati  Sandro Pertini è diventato vecchio  e Andreatta piange sconcertato  vedendo Craxi che ride nello specchio.  Sofia è dietro la finestra  tutti quanti le hanno detto che è bella  non ha ancora 53 anni  e mai nessuno l'ha chiamata zitella  la sua fuga sarà molto romantica  trasformandosi in oro se ne andrà  si è stufata di andare avanti e indietro in via della Povertà. Mongolfini travestito da pallone  ha nascosto i suoi appunti in un baule  è passato di qui un'ora fa  diretto verso l'ultima Thule\,  sembrava così timido e impaurito  quando ha chiesto di fermarsi un po' qui  ma poi ha cominciato a fumare  e a recitare l'A B C  ed a vederlo tu non lo diresti mai  ma era famoso qualche tempo fa  per suonare il violino elettrico  in via della Povertà. Ci si prepara per la grande festa  c'è qualcuno che comincia ad aver sete  Woityla ha gettato la ghiara si è travestito in abiti da prete  sta ingozzando a viva forza Berlinguer per punirlo della sua frugalità lo ucciderà parlandogli d'amore  dopo averlo avvelenato di pietà  e mentre Woityla grida  4 suore si son spogliate già  Berlinguer sta per essere violentato  in via della Povertà. E bravo Carboni mattacchione  il paese sta affondando nella merda e gli Anarchici tutti annegati e il capitano grida "ce ne stanno ancora"\,  e Agnelli e Indro Montanelli  fanno a pugni nella torre di comando  i suonatori di calipso ridono di loro  mentre il cielo si sta allontanando  e affacciati alle loro finestre nel mare  tutti pescano garofani e lillà  e nessuno deve più preoccuparsi  di via della Povertà. Il tuo articolo l'ho letto proprio ieri  ci hai messo dentro tutto quel che sai ma non essere ridicolo  non chiedermi "come stai"\,  questa gente di cui mi vai parlando  è quasi gente come tutti noi  non mi sembra che siano mostri  e né tanto meno eroi  e non mandarmi altre bozze da correggere nessuno ti risponderà  se non provi a spedirmi i tuoi articoli da via della Povertà.  Attraverso il gioco del rovescio della canzone di De André ha luogo la demitizzazione e la demistificazione. Via della Povertà ne offre un illuminato esempio. Marinai che affollano un salone di bellezza\, un commissario cieco che predice la sfortuna\, una Cenerentola non più ritrosa e fuggitiva ma spavalda ed energica come Bette Davis\, un Romeo che viene scacciato mentre fa la sua dichiarazione d'amore\, il Buon Samaritano che affila la pietà come se fosse un'arma e la indossa come una maschera di carnevale\, Mister Hyde in lacrime vedendo la sua parte cosiddetta sana "che ride nello specchio"\, un'Ofelia che si scopre zitella\, un Albert Einstein "travestito da ubriacone"\, il fantasma dell'opera "vestito in abiti da prete"\, un Casanova che "sta per essere violentato"\, il dio del mare che si diverte a far scendere negli abissi il Titanic mentre il sole si sta alzando: sono alcuni dei personaggi di un mondo carnevalizzato\, maschere di un teatrino dell'assurdo forse\, ma rivelatori di un modo d'essere degli uomini: "è gente come tutti noi / non mi sembra che siano mostri / non mi sembra che siano eroi".

COL title VAL Den vackraste visan COL performer VAL Karin Beckman	COL video title VAL Kris Kristofferson - For the good times (1970) COL description VAL Fair use - no copyright violation intended  "For the good times" from Kris' debut album "Kristofferson". It's so sad and beautiful at the same time...  Great lyrics as always\, and this beautiful tune ... I love it!  Of course this song was not written about Rita and him\, but things always happen twice in one's lifetime...  It was Kris'  first No 1 country hit as a writer in 1970 It was "Song of the Year" (and "Single Record of the Year") of the Academy of Country Music in 1970 - (That was the first time a writer had won "Song of the Year" awards from both the Country Music Association  - with "Sunday Mornin' comin' down"- AND the Academy of Country Music for different songs in the same year)  In 1971 Ray Price won a Grammy Award for "Best Male Country Vocal Performance" with it.  The scenes are from the movies "The last honor of Kathryn Beck"- aka "Act of Passion" (1984) and "Blood and Orchids" (TV\, 1986). Both movies are great to me and worth watching anyway\, but only available on VHS tapes. ... The latter one is available on DVD now http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0035QHNVU  Kris already began to write the song in 1968\, in his Opel\, on one of his endless rides from Nashville to the Gulf.   "I began a song about making love to a woman for the last time. After a while the melody really got to me. I couldn't wait to get to a guitar. I was riding along thinking about that part where it says\, 'Hear the whisper of the raindrops blowin' soft against the window\,' and I wondered if I could play it. I wrote only the first part of the lyrics then. A while went before I finished it\, I can't remember how long.... But I do remember who I wrote it about." Probably it was inspired by the dying days of his relationship to Fran...  Now it's hard to believe that for a time some radio stations wouldn't play the original recording by Bill Nash because of its "overtly sexual content"; indeed for a brief time\, Kris couldn't even find anyone who wanted to record the song... And then? A spokeman for Buckhorn Music\, which published the song shortly before Kris switched to Combine Music\, said later\, "It's recorded by pretty much everyone who comes into town to do an album\, Englebert Humperndinck\, Dean Martin\, Andy Williams\, Chet Atkins\, Loretta Lynn and many more."  For the good times  Don't look so sad\, I know it's over But life goes on and this old world will keep on turning Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together There's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning  Lay your head upon my pillow\, hold your warm and tender body close to mine Hear the whisper of the raindrops blowin' soft against the window And make believe you love me one more time For the good times   I'll get along\, you'll find another  And I'll be here if you should find  you ever need me Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever  There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me   Lay your head upon my pillow Hold your warm and tender body close to mine Hear the whisper of the raindrops Blowin' soft against my window Make believe you love me one more time For the good times   For the good times (1968)  Schau nicht so traurig\, ich weiß\, es ist vorbei. Aber das Leben geht weiter  und diese alte Welt wird sich weiterdrehen. Lass uns einfach froh sein\,  dass wir einige Zeit zusammen verbringen konnten Wir müssen uns nicht die Brücken anschauen\, die wir verbrennen.  Leg deinen Kopf auf mein Kissen\, halte deinen warmen und zärtlichen Körper  dicht an meinen Hör das Flüstern der Regentropfen  weich gegen das Fenster schlagen Und lass mich noch einmal glauben\, dass du mich liebst - wegen der guten Zeiten  Ich werd zurecht kommen\, du wirst einen anderen finden. Und ich werde hier sein falls du je entscheidest\, dass du mich brauchst. Sag kein Wort über das Morgen oder das Fürimmer. Es wird noch genug Zeit sein fürs Traurigsein wenn du mich verlässt...

COL title VAL Desolation Row COL performer VAL Songdog	COL video title VAL Via della Povertà [Desolation row] - Fabrizio De Andrè COL description VAL 1974 Canzoni ♫    Via della povertà  Testo italiano Fabrizio De André e Francesco De Gregori -Testo e Musica di Bob Dylan)  Autori: Fabrizio De Andrè ad eccezione di "Via della Povertà" De Andre'/De Gregori/Dylan; "Le passanti"\, "Morire per delle idee" e Deitto di paese De Andre'/Brassens; "Suzanne" e "Giovanna D'Arco" De Andre'/Cohen; "Valzer per un amore" De Andre'/Cohen..    Via della povertà    (versione LIVE eseguita a Viareggio nei primi anni "80)   Il Salone di bellezza in fondo al vicolo  è affollatissimo di marinai  prova a chiedere a uno che ore sono  e ti risponderà "non l'ho saputo mai".  Le cartoline dell'impiccagione  sono in vendita a cento lire l'una  il commissario cieco dietro la stazione  per un indizio ti legge la sfortuna  e le forze dell'ordine irrequiete  cercano qualcosa che non va  mentre io e la mia signora ci affacciamo stasera su via della Povertà. Signorile sembra così facile  ogni volta che sorride ti cattura  ricorda proprio Bette Davis  con le mani appoggiate alla cintura.  Arriva Lombardi trafelato  e le grida "la sinistra sei tu!"  ma qualcuno gli dice di andar via  perché ormai non esiste piu' e l'unico suono che rimane  quando l'ambulanza se ne va  è Signorile che spazza la strada  in via della Povertà. Mentre l'alba sta uccidendo la luna  e le stelle si son quasi nascoste  la signora che legge la fortuna  se n'è andata in compagnia dell'oste.  Ad eccezione di Abele e di Caino  tutti quanti sono andati a far l'amore  aspettando che venga la pioggia  ad annacquare la gioia ed il dolore  e il Cardinal Marcinkus sta affilando la sua pietà  se ne andrà a far la questua stasera  in via della Povertà. Al Quirinale sono disperati  Sandro Pertini è diventato vecchio  e Andreatta piange sconcertato  vedendo Craxi che ride nello specchio.  Sofia è dietro la finestra  tutti quanti le hanno detto che è bella  non ha ancora 53 anni  e mai nessuno l'ha chiamata zitella  la sua fuga sarà molto romantica  trasformandosi in oro se ne andrà  si è stufata di andare avanti e indietro in via della Povertà. Mongolfini travestito da pallone  ha nascosto i suoi appunti in un baule  è passato di qui un'ora fa  diretto verso l'ultima Thule\,  sembrava così timido e impaurito  quando ha chiesto di fermarsi un po' qui  ma poi ha cominciato a fumare  e a recitare l'A B C  ed a vederlo tu non lo diresti mai  ma era famoso qualche tempo fa  per suonare il violino elettrico  in via della Povertà. Ci si prepara per la grande festa  c'è qualcuno che comincia ad aver sete  Woityla ha gettato la ghiara si è travestito in abiti da prete  sta ingozzando a viva forza Berlinguer per punirlo della sua frugalità lo ucciderà parlandogli d'amore  dopo averlo avvelenato di pietà  e mentre Woityla grida  4 suore si son spogliate già  Berlinguer sta per essere violentato  in via della Povertà. E bravo Carboni mattacchione  il paese sta affondando nella merda e gli Anarchici tutti annegati e il capitano grida "ce ne stanno ancora"\,  e Agnelli e Indro Montanelli  fanno a pugni nella torre di comando  i suonatori di calipso ridono di loro  mentre il cielo si sta allontanando  e affacciati alle loro finestre nel mare  tutti pescano garofani e lillà  e nessuno deve più preoccuparsi  di via della Povertà. Il tuo articolo l'ho letto proprio ieri  ci hai messo dentro tutto quel che sai ma non essere ridicolo  non chiedermi "come stai"\,  questa gente di cui mi vai parlando  è quasi gente come tutti noi  non mi sembra che siano mostri  e né tanto meno eroi  e non mandarmi altre bozze da correggere nessuno ti risponderà  se non provi a spedirmi i tuoi articoli da via della Povertà.  Attraverso il gioco del rovescio della canzone di De André ha luogo la demitizzazione e la demistificazione. Via della Povertà ne offre un illuminato esempio. Marinai che affollano un salone di bellezza\, un commissario cieco che predice la sfortuna\, una Cenerentola non più ritrosa e fuggitiva ma spavalda ed energica come Bette Davis\, un Romeo che viene scacciato mentre fa la sua dichiarazione d'amore\, il Buon Samaritano che affila la pietà come se fosse un'arma e la indossa come una maschera di carnevale\, Mister Hyde in lacrime vedendo la sua parte cosiddetta sana "che ride nello specchio"\, un'Ofelia che si scopre zitella\, un Albert Einstein "travestito da ubriacone"\, il fantasma dell'opera "vestito in abiti da prete"\, un Casanova che "sta per essere violentato"\, il dio del mare che si diverte a far scendere negli abissi il Titanic mentre il sole si sta alzando: sono alcuni dei personaggi di un mondo carnevalizzato\, maschere di un teatrino dell'assurdo forse\, ma rivelatori di un modo d'essere degli uomini: "è gente come tutti noi / non mi sembra che siano mostri / non mi sembra che siano eroi".

Rebel Yell  ------------------------  "Seven Nation Army" is the first track on the album Elephant by American alternative rock band The White Stripes. It was released as a single in 2003. Seven Nation Army reached #1 on the Modern Rock Tracks for three weeks and won 2004's Grammy Award for Best Rock Song. The song is known for its underlying riff\, which plays throughout most of the song. Although it sounds like a bass guitar (an instrument the group had famously never previously used)\, the sound is actually created by running Jack White's semi-acoustic guitar (a 1950s style Kay Hollowbody) through a Digitech Whammy pedal set down an octave. The riff was composed at a sound check before a show at the Corner Hotel in Melbourne\, Australia\, according to the set notes in the booklet which accompanied the Under Blackpool Lights DVD. This riff was inspired by the main theme of Anton Bruckner's Fifth symphony.  According to White\, "Seven Nation Army" is what he used to call the Salvation Army as a child. The song ranked #1 on UpVenue's 10 best The White Stripes songs.  Critical  This song was number six on Rolling Stone's 2009 list of the 50 Best Songs of the Decade. In March 2005\, Q magazine placed "Seven Nation Army" at number 8 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks. In September 2005\, NME placed "Seven Nation Army" at number 5 in its list of the 50 Greatest Tracks Of The Decade. It was also called the 75th greatest hard rock song by VH1. In May 2008\, Rolling Stone placed this song at number 21 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time. "Seven Nation Army" also earned 20th place in Triple J's Hottest 100 of All Time in 2009. The song was also listed at #30 on Pitchfork Media's top 500 songs of the 2000s\, and at number 2 in Observer Music Monthly's top 75 songs of the decade\, behind Beyoncé's "Crazy in Love". It also came in second on Channel V Australia's top 1000 songs of the 00s. In 2009\, US website Consequence of Sound named this as their top rock track of the 2000s\, as did Boston's WFNX Radio. On Rolling Stone's updated version of their The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\, "Seven Nation Army" was listed at number 286. It was also ranked #1 on Rhapsody's list of the Top 100 Tracks of the Decade.  Cover versions  The song has been covered by the country music group The Oak Ridge Boys\, Funk Metal band Living Colour\, Rock supergroup Audioslave\, Alice Russell\, Nostalgia 77\, The Dynamics\, Flaming Lips\, Ben l'Oncle Soul\, Tomer G\, Kate Nash\, Nataly Dawn\, Kelly Clarkson\, OneRepublic\, Weezer\, The Strange\, Silent Thunder\, The Red Coats and many others.

COL title VAL It Might as Well Be Spring COL performer VAL Chris Connor	COL video title VAL Frank C. Stanley & Corinne Morgan - The Mocking Bird 1904 COL description VAL Victor 4080 - Frank C. Stanley & Corinne Morgan - The Mocking Bird 1904 - Music & Lyrics by Septimus Winner.  Frank C. Stanley (29 December 1868 -- 12 December 1910) was a bass-baritone singer\, stage performer and banjoist who made many early gramophone recordings on disc and cylinder during the 1890s and the 1900s. His real name was William Stanley Grinsted. He was born on 29 December 1868 in Orange\, New Jersey. From 1891 onwards he made banjo recordings for the Edison Phonograph Company under his own name. When he started to make vocal recordings\, he did that under the Frank Stanley pseudonym. In the early 1900s he organized the Columbia Quartet\, and in 1906 it was renamed the Peerless Quartet when it started to record for companies other than Columbia. He died of pleurisy on 12 December 1910 at his home in Orange.  Corinne Morgan (16 February 1876 -- 1945?) was the stage name of Corinne (or Cora) Welsh. She was a contralto singer and pioneer recording artist who recorded popular songs in the early years of the twentieth century and was best known for her duets with Frank Stanley. Some sources misspell her name as Corrine. She was born at Commercial Point\, Ohio\, the daughter of John C. Welsh\, a farmer\, and later moved to New York City. In 1902\, she started recording for the major cylinder recording companies of the day\, including Edison and Columbia\, although after 1904 most of her recordings were for Victor Records. She was one of the first female singers to record regularly\, and mainly recorded sentimental rather than comic songs. She does not seem to have recorded after 1909\, but worked as a professional singer until at least 1919. Most sources give her year of death as 1945\, although a date in 1942 has also been suggested.

Márcio Greyck apresentou um programa chamado "O Mundo é dos Jovens"\, na extinta TV Tupi de São Paulo\, ao lado da cantora Sandra\, em 1967. Nessa época\, Roberto Carlos apresentava o programa "Jovem Guarda" na TV Record\, exibido de 1965 a 1968. Revista ROLLING STONE\, Outubro de 2008\, pag 158 : "No ano em que o mundo comemora as 40 primaveras do White Album\, lançado em 1968\, o Brasil acaba de dar à luz uma versão também democrática do disco duplo dos Beatles. No original\, pela primeira vez\, Paul\, John e George abriram espaço para Ringo colocar uma música sua no repertório\, e\, como instrumentistas\, cada um teve a chance de se mostrar individualmente. No Álbum Branco produzido pelo jornalista e pesquisador Marcelo Fróes\, os 30 convidados imprimiram seu estilo às músicas. Zé Ramalho canta "Dear Prudence" na velha conhecida "atmosfera mística"\, enquanto Daniel Tendler\, com timbre grave e vocal cuidadoso\, transforma "The Continuing Story Of Bungalow Bill" em canção para ninar gente grande. Pato Fu fez "Birthday" com cara de... Pato Fu. "I Will"\, com Érika Martins\, virou um delicioso folk\, enquanto "Julia" fez as vezes de bossa nova na voz e no violão de Celso Fonseca. Grande surpresa é a versão de Márcio Greyck para "Martha My Dear": com voz dobrada\, o músico faz bela interpretação da canção de Lennon e McCartney." (..)

She developed an interest in jazz from an early age\, through her father's collection of 78rpm records\, becoming "obsessed" with big band singers like Ella Fitzgerald and big bands like Joe Loss.  "I Only Have Eyes for You" is a popular romantic love song by composer Harry Warren and lyricist Al Dubin\, written in 1934. The song is a jazz standard\, and has been covered by thousands of musicians. -Lyrics - Are the stars out tonight? I don't know if it's cloudy or bright 'Cause I only have eyes for you\, dear The moon may be high But I can't see a thing in the sky 'Cause I only have eyes for you. I don't know if we're in a garden Or on a crowded avenue You are here\, so am I Maybe millions of people go by But they all disappear from view And I only have eyes for you I don't know if we're in a garden Or on a crowded avenue You are here\, so am I Maybe millions of people go by But they all disappear from view And I only have eyes for you.  - Song and images belong to their respective owners - COL channel name VAL Dreamer8girl	0

She quickly became a popular attraction. Hall left the Taft in 1940\, taking Dolly with him. In July of 1941 he grew weary of leading a band and turned over his orchestra to Dolly\, renaming it Dolly Dawn and her Dawn Patrol. Dolly was successful leading the group\, but the stress of the job soon got to her. Her singing career was doing quite well\, and she found it easier to book herself solo than with the band. In March of 1942 she gave up the orchestra. COL channel name VAL warholsoup100	0

Márcio Greyck apresentou um programa chamado "O Mundo é dos Jovens"\, na extinta TV Tupi de São Paulo\, ao lado da cantora Sandra\, em 1967. Nessa época\, Roberto Carlos apresentava o programa "Jovem Guarda" na TV Record\, exibido de 1965 a 1968. Revista ROLLING STONE\, Outubro de 2008\, pag 158 : "No ano em que o mundo comemora as 40 primaveras do White Album\, lançado em 1968\, o Brasil acaba de dar à luz uma versão também democrática do disco duplo dos Beatles. No original\, pela primeira vez\, Paul\, John e George abriram espaço para Ringo colocar uma música sua no repertório\, e\, como instrumentistas\, cada um teve a chance de se mostrar individualmente. No Álbum Branco produzido pelo jornalista e pesquisador Marcelo Fróes\, os 30 convidados imprimiram seu estilo às músicas. Zé Ramalho canta "Dear Prudence" na velha conhecida "atmosfera mística"\, enquanto Daniel Tendler\, com timbre grave e vocal cuidadoso\, transforma "The Continuing Story Of Bungalow Bill" em canção para ninar gente grande. Pato Fu fez "Birthday" com cara de... Pato Fu. "I Will"\, com Érika Martins\, virou um delicioso folk\, enquanto "Julia" fez as vezes de bossa nova na voz e no violão de Celso Fonseca. Grande surpresa é a versão de Márcio Greyck para "Martha My Dear": com voz dobrada\, o músico faz bela interpretação da canção de Lennon e McCartney." (..)

Their line up was: George "Banduk" Apostolakis -- vocals and guitar (he played xylophone too later) Alex Apostolakis -- drums\, and Thodoros Kondouris -- bass.  Playing mainly a mixture of post punk and art rock with some funk elements\, they were always experimenting on stage trying to explore new styles and sounds.  They released 2 albums. 'Silence' and 'Catalog'. The band split after these two albums and later\, George "Banduk" toured and recorded with the blues band Blues Wire.  ------------------------  "Move on Up" is a song by Curtis Mayfield from his 1970 debut album Curtis. In 1971\, the song spent ten weeks in the top 50 of the UK Singles Chart\, but it did not chart in the United States. In 2001 Bran Van 3000 recorded "Astounded"\, which featured Curtis Mayfield singing the lyrics of "Move on Up". In 2008\, it was used at the end of the movie Semi-Pro\, starring Will Ferrell and was covered by Lettuce featuring Dwele on Rage! album\, as well as Los Fabulosos Cadillacs on the 2009 album El Arte De La Elegancia De LFC (under the Spanish title "Vamos Ya"). It was covered by The Flying Lizards on their 1981 Fourth Wall LP. It was also covered by The Jam on the 1982 "Beat Surrender" EP. It was featured prominently in the Wire episode Margin of Error (The Wire)\, as the ex-con Dennis "Cutty" Wise jogs across town listening to the song on Election Day.  Disco version  In 1979\, disco trio\, Destination\, recorded the song\, incorporating the song\, "Keep on Pushing"\, a 1964 hit by The Impressions. Along with the tracks\, "Up Up Up" and "Destination's Theme\, "Move on Up"\, hit number one on the disco chart for four weeks. It peaked at number sixty-eight on the soul singles chart.  "Move On Up" is regularly featured in concerts by the Hip-Hop group The Roots.  It is played after each Arsenal FC game played at the Emirates Stadium.  It is featured in the 1974 U.S. film "The Groove Tube".  It is also featured in the 2002 British film Bend It Like Beckham.  It was also heavily sampled for the Kanye West song "Touch the Sky"\, from West's album Late Registration.

The New York Voices was formed through a college alumni group and released their first\, self-titled album in 1989 and won a Grammy award for their 1996 collaboration with the Basie band\, Count Basie Orchestra with New York Voices Live at Manchester Craftsmen's Guild. Initially a sextet the NYV have\, through numerous member changes\, become a quintet and now a quartet. Besides their performances they give jazz clinics at schools and universities. They have to date released seven albums\, all blends of classical\, pop\, R&B\, Brazilian and jazz. This is primarily a pop-oriented date with the exception of the opening "All Blues" and "Lady Be Good". The latter is meant as a tribute to Ella Fitzgerald since it quotes from her famous scat solo. Seven of the 11 selections are group originals. Also included are Bill Wither's "Ain't No Sunshine" and James Taylor's "Traffic Jam". Not too many copies of this album around now as it's been out of print for a while. COL channel name VAL Damir Aleksic	0

COL title VAL Photographic COL performer VAL Louis Guidone	COL video title VAL Ferrante and Teicher -   Tie A Yellow Ribbon COL description VAL "Endeavour to play easy pieces well and with elegance; that is better than to play difficult pieces badly." ― Robert Schumann ▼▼▼  FERRANTE AND TEICHER Ferrante & Teicher were a duo of American piano players\, known for their light arrangements of familiar classical pieces\, movie soundtracks\, show tunes and popsongs. Arthur Ferrante and Louis Teicher met while studying at the Juilliard School of Music in New York.  Musical prodigies\, they began performing as a piano duo while still in school. After graduating\, they both joined the Juilliard faculty. In 1947\, they launched a full-time concert career\, at first playing nightclubs\, then quickly moving up to playing classical music with orchestral backing.  Between 1950 and 1980\, they were a major American easy listening act\, and scored four big U.S. hits: "Theme From The Apartment" \, "Theme From Exodus" \, "Tonight" \, and "Midnight Cowboy" . They performed and recorded regularly with pops orchestras popular standards by George Gershwin\, Jerome Kern\, Cole Porter\, Richard Rodgers and others. In 1973\, they did the Hollywood Radio Theater theme for the Rod Serling radio drama series\, The Zero Hour. Both men were initiated as honorary members of Tau Kappa Epsilon at Central State University (now University of Central Oklahoma) while on tour. Ferrante and Teicher ceased performing in 1989 and retired to Longboat Key and Siesta Key\, respectively\, both close to each other on the west coast of Florida. They continued to play together occasionally at a local piano store. CDs of their music\, some of it not previously released\, have continued to appear.  TIE A YELLOW RIBBON "Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree"  was written by Irwin Levine and L. Russell Brown and was a worldwide hit for the group "Dawn" (featuring Tony Orlando)  in 1973.   The origin of the idea of a yellow ribbon as remembrance may have been the 19th century practice that some women allegedly had of wearing a yellow ribbon in their hair to signify their devotion to a husband or sweetheart serving in the U.S. Cavalry. The song "'Round Her Neck She Wears a Yeller Ribbon"\, which later inspired the John Wayne movie "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"\, is a reference to this. The symbol of a yellow ribbon became widely known in civilian life in the 1970s as a reminder that an absent loved one\, either in the military or in jail\, would be welcomed home on their return.  MHO A beautiful "full body" arrangement of this famous seventies pop theme with the piano's of Ferrante and Teicher backed up by a large orchestra.  Some really enjoyable and unexpected counterpart melodies with both the brass and the strings coming out equally surprising.   The "knacky" rhythm that can be heard in the background adds to the listening pleasure.   Have fun and enjoy ! COL channel name VAL Socratess2007	0

I was just\, I was just\,  I was just sitting here thinking  Of your kiss and your warm embrace\,  When the reflection in the glass that I held to my lips\, baby  Revealed the tears that was on my face.   And  Baby\, Baby\, I'd rather be blind\, boy\,  Than to see you walk away from me. COL channel name VAL CynicalHippie	0

COL title VAL Sh Boom COL performer VAL Baldwin and The Whiffles	COL video title VAL Ferrante and Teicher -   Tie A Yellow Ribbon COL description VAL "Endeavour to play easy pieces well and with elegance; that is better than to play difficult pieces badly." ― Robert Schumann ▼▼▼  FERRANTE AND TEICHER Ferrante & Teicher were a duo of American piano players\, known for their light arrangements of familiar classical pieces\, movie soundtracks\, show tunes and popsongs. Arthur Ferrante and Louis Teicher met while studying at the Juilliard School of Music in New York.  Musical prodigies\, they began performing as a piano duo while still in school. After graduating\, they both joined the Juilliard faculty. In 1947\, they launched a full-time concert career\, at first playing nightclubs\, then quickly moving up to playing classical music with orchestral backing.  Between 1950 and 1980\, they were a major American easy listening act\, and scored four big U.S. hits: "Theme From The Apartment" \, "Theme From Exodus" \, "Tonight" \, and "Midnight Cowboy" . They performed and recorded regularly with pops orchestras popular standards by George Gershwin\, Jerome Kern\, Cole Porter\, Richard Rodgers and others. In 1973\, they did the Hollywood Radio Theater theme for the Rod Serling radio drama series\, The Zero Hour. Both men were initiated as honorary members of Tau Kappa Epsilon at Central State University (now University of Central Oklahoma) while on tour. Ferrante and Teicher ceased performing in 1989 and retired to Longboat Key and Siesta Key\, respectively\, both close to each other on the west coast of Florida. They continued to play together occasionally at a local piano store. CDs of their music\, some of it not previously released\, have continued to appear.  TIE A YELLOW RIBBON "Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree"  was written by Irwin Levine and L. Russell Brown and was a worldwide hit for the group "Dawn" (featuring Tony Orlando)  in 1973.   The origin of the idea of a yellow ribbon as remembrance may have been the 19th century practice that some women allegedly had of wearing a yellow ribbon in their hair to signify their devotion to a husband or sweetheart serving in the U.S. Cavalry. The song "'Round Her Neck She Wears a Yeller Ribbon"\, which later inspired the John Wayne movie "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"\, is a reference to this. The symbol of a yellow ribbon became widely known in civilian life in the 1970s as a reminder that an absent loved one\, either in the military or in jail\, would be welcomed home on their return.  MHO A beautiful "full body" arrangement of this famous seventies pop theme with the piano's of Ferrante and Teicher backed up by a large orchestra.  Some really enjoyable and unexpected counterpart melodies with both the brass and the strings coming out equally surprising.   The "knacky" rhythm that can be heard in the background adds to the listening pleasure.   Have fun and enjoy ! COL channel name VAL Socratess2007	0

Rebel Yell  ------------------------  "Seven Nation Army" is the first track on the album Elephant by American alternative rock band The White Stripes. It was released as a single in 2003. Seven Nation Army reached #1 on the Modern Rock Tracks for three weeks and won 2004's Grammy Award for Best Rock Song. The song is known for its underlying riff\, which plays throughout most of the song. Although it sounds like a bass guitar (an instrument the group had famously never previously used)\, the sound is actually created by running Jack White's semi-acoustic guitar (a 1950s style Kay Hollowbody) through a Digitech Whammy pedal set down an octave. The riff was composed at a sound check before a show at the Corner Hotel in Melbourne\, Australia\, according to the set notes in the booklet which accompanied the Under Blackpool Lights DVD. This riff was inspired by the main theme of Anton Bruckner's Fifth symphony.  According to White\, "Seven Nation Army" is what he used to call the Salvation Army as a child. The song ranked #1 on UpVenue's 10 best The White Stripes songs.  Critical  This song was number six on Rolling Stone's 2009 list of the 50 Best Songs of the Decade. In March 2005\, Q magazine placed "Seven Nation Army" at number 8 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks. In September 2005\, NME placed "Seven Nation Army" at number 5 in its list of the 50 Greatest Tracks Of The Decade. It was also called the 75th greatest hard rock song by VH1. In May 2008\, Rolling Stone placed this song at number 21 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time. "Seven Nation Army" also earned 20th place in Triple J's Hottest 100 of All Time in 2009. The song was also listed at #30 on Pitchfork Media's top 500 songs of the 2000s\, and at number 2 in Observer Music Monthly's top 75 songs of the decade\, behind Beyoncé's "Crazy in Love". It also came in second on Channel V Australia's top 1000 songs of the 00s. In 2009\, US website Consequence of Sound named this as their top rock track of the 2000s\, as did Boston's WFNX Radio. On Rolling Stone's updated version of their The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\, "Seven Nation Army" was listed at number 286. It was also ranked #1 on Rhapsody's list of the Top 100 Tracks of the Decade.  Cover versions  The song has been covered by the country music group The Oak Ridge Boys\, Funk Metal band Living Colour\, Rock supergroup Audioslave\, Alice Russell\, Nostalgia 77\, The Dynamics\, Flaming Lips\, Ben l'Oncle Soul\, Tomer G\, Kate Nash\, Nataly Dawn\, Kelly Clarkson\, OneRepublic\, Weezer\, The Strange\, Silent Thunder\, The Red Coats and many others.

COL title VAL A Girl I Used to Know COL performer VAL Tompall & The Glaser Brothers	COL video title VAL Ferrante and Teicher -   Tie A Yellow Ribbon COL description VAL "Endeavour to play easy pieces well and with elegance; that is better than to play difficult pieces badly." ― Robert Schumann ▼▼▼  FERRANTE AND TEICHER Ferrante & Teicher were a duo of American piano players\, known for their light arrangements of familiar classical pieces\, movie soundtracks\, show tunes and popsongs. Arthur Ferrante and Louis Teicher met while studying at the Juilliard School of Music in New York.  Musical prodigies\, they began performing as a piano duo while still in school. After graduating\, they both joined the Juilliard faculty. In 1947\, they launched a full-time concert career\, at first playing nightclubs\, then quickly moving up to playing classical music with orchestral backing.  Between 1950 and 1980\, they were a major American easy listening act\, and scored four big U.S. hits: "Theme From The Apartment" \, "Theme From Exodus" \, "Tonight" \, and "Midnight Cowboy" . They performed and recorded regularly with pops orchestras popular standards by George Gershwin\, Jerome Kern\, Cole Porter\, Richard Rodgers and others. In 1973\, they did the Hollywood Radio Theater theme for the Rod Serling radio drama series\, The Zero Hour. Both men were initiated as honorary members of Tau Kappa Epsilon at Central State University (now University of Central Oklahoma) while on tour. Ferrante and Teicher ceased performing in 1989 and retired to Longboat Key and Siesta Key\, respectively\, both close to each other on the west coast of Florida. They continued to play together occasionally at a local piano store. CDs of their music\, some of it not previously released\, have continued to appear.  TIE A YELLOW RIBBON "Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree"  was written by Irwin Levine and L. Russell Brown and was a worldwide hit for the group "Dawn" (featuring Tony Orlando)  in 1973.   The origin of the idea of a yellow ribbon as remembrance may have been the 19th century practice that some women allegedly had of wearing a yellow ribbon in their hair to signify their devotion to a husband or sweetheart serving in the U.S. Cavalry. The song "'Round Her Neck She Wears a Yeller Ribbon"\, which later inspired the John Wayne movie "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"\, is a reference to this. The symbol of a yellow ribbon became widely known in civilian life in the 1970s as a reminder that an absent loved one\, either in the military or in jail\, would be welcomed home on their return.  MHO A beautiful "full body" arrangement of this famous seventies pop theme with the piano's of Ferrante and Teicher backed up by a large orchestra.  Some really enjoyable and unexpected counterpart melodies with both the brass and the strings coming out equally surprising.   The "knacky" rhythm that can be heard in the background adds to the listening pleasure.   Have fun and enjoy ! COL channel name VAL Socratess2007	0

Herbert Jay Solomon (April 16\, 1930  July 1\, 2003)\, better known as Herbie Mann\, was a Jewish American jazz flautist and important early practitioner of world music. Early in his career\, he also played saxophones and clarinets (including bass clarinet)\, but Mann was among the first jazz musicians to specialize on the flute and was perhaps jazz music's preeminent flautist during the 1960s.

COL title VAL Little Green Apples COL performer VAL Ginette Reno	COL video title VAL Lenny Dee - His Organ and Orchestra -  For Once in my Life COL description VAL " Life is like a beautiful melody\, only the lyrics are messed up ."  ―---- Hans Christian Andersen  Lenny Dee Leonard George DeStoppelaire (January 5\, 1923 -- February 12\, 2006)\, better known as Lenny Dee\, was a virtuoso organist who played many styles of music. His record albums were among the most popular of easy listening and space age pop organists of the 1950s through the early 1970s. His signature hit\, Plantation Boogie\, charted as a Top 20 hit in 1955. He also had a gold record with 1970's Spinning Wheel. Dee played a variety of songs in numerous styles. He played original compositions\, popular songs\, and novelty tunes\, and was a master of improvisation. Although his unique style was a pop/boogie-woogie blend\, he also played ballads\, country and western\, jazz\, rock\, and patriotic songs. As a child\, he sang in his church's choir; he also played ukulele and accordion. As a teenager\, he turned playing the accordion into a profession\, which he continued until he was drafted into the Navy during World War II in 1943. Upon his return from service\, Dee spent his Navy earnings on a Hammond Model A organ\, one of the earliest of its kind. With money from the G.I. Bill\, he received instruction in organ at the Chicago Conservatory of Music. Afterward\, he began playing hotels and night clubs in the south in the late 1940s to some degree of success\, but very little fame and no record contracts. It was not until the early 1950s that Dee was signed up to Decca after country singer Red Foley heard him playing at the Plantation Inn in Nashville\, Tennessee\, and thought Dee's country flavor would be a good contrast to the label's then prominent organist\, Ethel Smith. Dee made good\, and his original composition\, Plantation Boogie charted at #18 in 1955. Dee re-recorded the hit on numerous albums\, and was often imitated\, even plagiarized\, but never duplicated. Dee ventured into recording albums for Decca starting in 1954 with his first LP\, Dee-lightful. Part of Dee's charm was his albums' zany covers featuring Dee in various situations\, and titles with puns that usually included his name\, such as Dee-Lirious\, Dee-Licious\, and Dee-Most! His recording featured organ with other instruments. He was nearly always backed by percussion; depending on the song\, he also recorded with guitar; bass; a backup chorus; strings; horns such as saxophones\, trombones\, trumpets; and even the banjo.  Dee continued recording into the 1970s\, adding a background orchestra in the late '60s as many other easy listening performers were doing at the time. By the late 1970s\, Dee was in less demand. After recording 56 albums\, he was finally dropped from the MCA label\, along with many other easy listening artists. Dee spent the rest of his career at his night clubs and on tour\, but the demand for his music continued to decline. In 1999\, Dee played on a series of cruise ship tours. He retired in 2003. He died on February 12\, 2006 in St. Petersburg.  For Once In My Life "For Once in My Life" is a swing song written by Ron Miller and Orlando Murden for Motown Records' Jobete publishing company in 1967.   The composition was originally recorded by Jean DuShon\, while other artists\, such as Tony Bennett and The Temptations\, recorded slow ballad versions of the song. Jack Soo was the first male artist to record a version of the song—it never made it to any public market and the recording was permanently shelved in the Motown Records archives.  The most familiar and successful version of "For Once in My Life" is an uptempo arrangement by Stevie Wonder\, recorded immediately after DuShon's original.   Wonder's version (issued on Motown's Tamla label) was a top-three hit in the United States in late 1968 and early 1969. Remarkably\, the song became one of the most covered songs of all time (it's estimated that by now some 300 different versions have been recorded) - it also became part of popular culture because it appeared in many films and television programs\, as well as in commercials.  MHO Arranger Bill Mc Enhiley wrote this fabulous up-tempo arrangement for Lenny and "Mr Dee" is clearly enjoying himself when he plays this well known Stevie Wonder hit. The supporting orchestra is in good shape as well and provides the ideal background for Lenny as he delivers some great improvisation here and there.  Hearing this\, it will not come as surprise to you that Lenny Dee was one of the most successful artists in the field of easy listening\, and especially in the hammond organ branche.  From the 1969 album "Little Green Apples" here's Lenny Dee & His Orchestra with "For Once in my Life". ENJOY !

The standard\, "Chloe\," was written in 1927 and recorded over the years by many well-known recording artists\, including the Paul Whiteman Orchestra in 1928 and Louis Armstrong in 1953.

"Through the black of night\, I've got to go where you are. If it's wrong or right\, I've got to go where you are!  "I'll roam through the dismal swamp land Searching for you; 'Cause if you are lost there\, Let me be there\, too!  "Through the smoke and flames\, I've got to go where you are; For no place could be too far\, Where you are!  "Ain't no chains can bind you; If you live\, I'll find you. Love is calling me; I've got to go where you are!"  The swamp land pictorial interlude includes illustrations from vintage magazines in the collection of abendstunde49.

This is one of her first recordings in 1923 with pianist Clarence Williams. In no other way than living the kind of violent\, hard-drinking street life she sang about\, could Bessie Smith have inspired in her audiences the powerful empathy that ultimately won her the title\, "Empress of the Blues." Throughout her career\, Bessie was respected for being a strong\, independent African-American woman with tremendous talent and determination. She expressed great pride in her culture\, and gladly participated in its earthy pleasures\, regularly indulging her taste for alcohol and sex to extremes. How ever much others tried to run roughshod over her\, Bessie refused to submit to the slightest abuse without a knock-down\, drag-out fight. With few exceptions\, she held to her musical ideals with equal tenacity. Though musically illiterate\, she regularly collaborated with her pianists to compose and write down her music and her words frequently touched on pertinent events in her life. Her performance style\, too\, derives considerably from her own personal and cultural attributes. (first posted on ilbofilms feb 24 2008; 492 views) COL channel name VAL Henri Erwig	0

COL title VAL Nature Boy COL performer VAL Lisa Ekdahl\, Peter Nordahl Trio	COL video title VAL Bobby Scott  "Nature Boy"      (1990) COL description VAL In 1941\, a 33 year old George McGrew arrived in Los Angeles and began playing piano in the Eutropheon\, a small health food store and raw food restaurant on Laurel Canyon Boulevard. The cafe was owned by John and Vera Richter\, German immigrants who followed a Naturmensch and Lebensreform philosophy influenced by the Wandervogel movement in Germany.Their followers\, known as "Nature Boys"\, wore long hair and beards and ate only raw fruits and vegetables. McGrew adopted the philosophy and chose the name "eden ahbez"\, writing and spelling his name with lower-case letters. It was there while living in a cave near Palm Springs\, ahbez wrote "Nature Boy". Partly autobiographical\, the song was a tribute to his mentor Bill Pester\, who had originally introduced him to Naturmensch and Lebensreform.  In 1947\, at the prompting of Cowboy Jack Patton and Johnny Mercer\, ahbez approached Nat King Cole's manager backstage at the Lincoln Theater in Los Angeles\, handed him a tattered copy of "Nature Boy"\, and asked him to show it to Cole. However his pleas were ignored and a disappointed ahbez left the sheet music of "Nature Boy" with Cole's valet\, Otis Pollard. From him Cole came to know of the song and after reading it\, the singer loved it and began playing "Nature Boy" for live audiences to much acclaim. Irving Berlin\, who was present in the crowd\, had initially offered to buy the track from Cole. But he decided to record the track for himself and needed to get permission from ahbez before releasing it as a single. After ahbez was discovered living under the Hollywood Sign\, Cole got his permission and recorded the song COL channel name VAL nyronut	1
COL title VAL Sharp Dressed Man COL performer VAL The Charlie Daniels Band	COL video title VAL SALTY HOLMES - Blue Eyes Cryin' in the Rain.wmv COL description VAL Recorded by Salty in the 40's\, it is now an ironic tribute to the love of his life\, Mattie O'Neil aka Jean Chapel. Their marriage ended in 1957\, but his love for her never did. It was an unusually amicable ending caused by his drinking problem and the seperate success she began to have when she went into rock & roll as Jean Chapel. Sadly he was left in the wings.   He passed away on Jan.1\, 1970\, and she passed on Aug. 12\, 1995. Both had remarried\, but the bond had never been truly broken between them\, mainly because of their daughter Lana.  Lana and her Mom\, whom he always called Mattie\, drank a private toast together to him every New Year's Eve after his death. New Year's Eve was his favorite and most sentimental occassion...and strangely enough\, he lived through New Year's Eve of 1969 in the hospital to die in the early hours of New Year's Day\, 1970.  Both Salty and Matiie had the same birthday of Mar. 6th..though different years. They had a truly psychic connection.  Maybe they're jamming again on that big stage in the sky..... Lana would surely like to think so\, for she'd like to get back into the act again someday.... COL channel name VAL SALTYHOLMES	0

Dámaso Pérez Prado es mayormente conocido por sus aportes al género del mambo\, que tiene sus orígenes en el danzón cubano y daría pauta al surgimiento y desarrollo del chachachá\, así como también de la música surgida a finales de la década de los cincuenta y conocida luego\, a finales de los años setenta y principio de los ochenta como salsa. Pasado el clímax del mambo\, es llamativo que Dámaso Pérez Prado\, una vez compuesta su pieza musical "Patricia" y obtenido su éxito correspondiente\, la grabase muchas veces y con diferentes arreglos\, actitud que parece demostrar que tuvo por dicha pieza una especial predilección. Entre sus composiciones más conocidas se encuentran Qué rico el mambo y Mambo Nº 5\, ésta última después lanzada en una nueva versión en 1999 por el cantante alemán Lou Bega. Destacan otras canciones como sus interpretaciones en "El Manisero" "Calypso Man" "La Macarena" "El Millonario" "Cuatro Paredes" "Marilyn Monroe Mambo" y muchas más.

COL title VAL Since I Fell for You COL performer VAL Aaron Neville	COL video title VAL Paul Mauriat: ♫ L'Amour est bleu (Love is Blue) ♫ COL description VAL Sucesso de Paul Mauriat e sua orquestra em 1968\, "L'Amour est bleu" ("Love is Blue")  é uma composição de Pierre Cour e André Popp\, que a gravou originalmente em 1967. A canção foi enorme sucesso não só na França\, mas também em vários países do mundo\, e recebeu inúmeras gravações\, como as de Caravelli\, Claudine Longet\, Clementine\, Gabor Szabo\, Jeff Beck\, Los Indios Trabajaras\, Michel Fugain\, Michele Torr\, Ray Conniff\, Richard Clayderman\, Sandpipers\, Santo and Johnny\, The Dells\, Vicky Leandros e outros. No Brasil foram registrações versões\, intituladas "O amor é azul"\,  de Clara Nunes\, Celly Campello\, Luiz Loy e seu Conjunto e The Jordans. A gravação de Paul Mauriat é o principal hit da carreira deste orquestrador francês nascido em 4 de março de 1925 em Marselha.  O talento de Paul Mauriat é hereditário. Era filho de uma família de músicos\, tendo seu pai como primeiro mestre. Aos quatro anos\, iniciou seus estudos de piano. Aos dez\, entra para o Conservatório de Paris\, saindo quatro anos mais tarde decidido a seguir a carreira de concertista. O encontro com o jazz\, entretanto\, muda os planos iniciais do artista. O novo ritmo decididamente influencia o estilo que o tornaria famoso em todo o mundo.  Mauriat cresceu em Paris e aos dezessete anos\, organiza sua própria orquestra\, apresentando-se em cabarés e teatros na França e em outros países da Europa. Na década de 50\, tornou-se o arranjador preferido de vários cantores franceses\, entre os quais se destaca a figura de Charles Aznavour. Fã da Música Popular Brasileira\, Mauriat gravou clássicos como Casa no campo (Zé Rodrix - Tavito)\, Amada amante (Roberto Carlos - Erasmo Carlos)\, Presepada (Antonio Carlos - Jocafi)\, Naquela mesa (Sergio Bittencourt)\, Viagem (J.de Aquino - Paulo César Pinheiro) e outros.  Ele se retirou da profissão em 1998\, num último show em Osaka\, Japão. Mas a orquestra ainda faz shows pelo mundo\, e inclusive fez duas viagens para a China. Em 2002 o escritor e perito na vida do maestro\, Serge Elhaik lançou uma biografia autorizada escrita em francês\, que se chama "Une vie en Bleu". Esta biografia contém valiosas informações sobre a discografia de Mauriat e muitas fotos dele e de sua orquestra. Nos últimos meses de vida\, o maestro ficou residindo em sua casa de verão na cidade de Perpignan. Foi internado no hospital da cidade\, muito fraco e\, após 2 dias internado\, a 1 da manhã do dia 3 de Novembro (horário local) de 2006\, Paul Mauriat faleceu aos 81 anos.

Active as a recording artist from 1956 to 1970\, he is known primarily for his hit single\, "From a Jack to a King"\, a crossover hit in 1962 which reached Top 10 on the country music\, adult contemporary\, and Billboard Hot 100 charts. He had several more chart singles in his career\, though none matched the peak of "From a Jack to a King". He composed and recorded "Invisible Tears\," which was later recorded by Connie Smith\, Bobby Bare\, and the Ray Conniff Singers.Biography  Miller's start as a songwriter came when he was sixteen years old.[2] He later joined the United States Marine Corps\, from which he was later discharged. In 1956\, both Gale Storm and Bonnie Guitar had Top Five hits with different versions of the song "Dark Moon"\, which Miller co-wrote.[2] Another song he wrote "A Falling Star"\, was a country hit for Jimmy C. Newman. Very notable is also his uptempo song "Cave In"\, which in 1960 was the flip side of Warren Smiths\, #5 country hit "I Don't Believe I'll Fall In Love Today" recorded for the Liberty records label. He also wrote and recorded a song called "From a Jack to a King"\, which was released on Fabor Records but saw little success on the charts.[3] After being briefly signed to Capitol Records\, Miller returned to Fabor and persuaded them to re-release "From a Jack to a King". The song proved successful the second time around\, and became a crossover hit for Miller.[2] It sold over two million copies by July 1963\, and was awarded a gold disc.[4]  Miller was not particularly interested in his singing career\, and rarely toured owing to stage fright.[3] He gave up recording in the 1970s and soon moved to Prescott\, Arizona\, and later to Las Vegas\, Nevada.[3]  Country music artist Ricky Van Shelton covered "From a Jack to a King" in the 1980s; his version reached Number One on the country music chart.[2] [edit] Discography [edit] Albums Year  Album  Chart Positions  Label U.S. Country  U.S. 1963  From a Jack to a King   50  Fabor 1965  Ned Miller Sings the Songs of Ned Miller    Capitol The Best of Ned Miller  28   1967  Teardrop Lane  22   1968  In the Name of Love    1970  Ned Miller's Back    Republic 1981  From a Jack to a King    Plantation [edit] Singles Year  Single  U.S. Country  U.S.  U.S. AC  UK[5]  IRE  Album 1957  "Roll O' Rollin' Stone"  —  —  —  —  —  singles only "From a Jack to a King"  —  —  —  —  — "Lights in the Street"  —  —  —  —  — 1958  "Gypsy"  —  —  —  —  — 1959  "Ring the Bell for Johnny"  —  —  —  —  — 1961  "Cold Gray Bars"  —  —  —  —  — "Dark Moon"  —  —  —  —  — 1962  "From a Jack to a King" (re-release)  2  6  3  2  1  From a Jack to a King 1963  "One Among the Many"  27  —  —  —  — "Another Fool Like Me"  28  —  —  —  —  singles only "Big Love"  —  —  —  —  — 1964  "Invisible Tears"  13  131  —  —  —  The Best 1965  "Do What You Do Do Well"  7  52  —  48  — "Two Voices\, Two Shadows\, Two Faces"  —  —  —  —  —  Songs of Ned Miller "Whistle Walkin'"  28  —  —  —  — "Down the Street"  —  —  —  —  — 1966  "Lovin' Pains"  —  —  —  —  —  The Best "Summer Roses"  39  —  —  —  —  Teardrop Lane "Teardrop Lane"  44  —  —  —  — 1967  "Echo of the Pines"  —  —  —  —  —  singles only "Hobo"  53  —  —  —  — 1968  "Only a Fool"  61  —  —  —  —  In the Name of Love 1969  "Autumn Winds"  —  —  —  —  —  singles only 1970  "Breakin'"  —  —  —  —  — "Lover's Song"  39  —  —  —  —  Ned Miller's Back "Back to Oklahoma"  —  —  —  —  — COL channel name VAL Amnondoowop	0

COL title VAL Everytime You Go Away COL performer VAL Boyz Nite Out	COL video title VAL Sonny Rollins: Sonnymoon for Two COL description VAL Theodore Walter "Sonny" Rollins (born September 7\, 1930 in New York City) is an American jazz tenor saxophonist. Rollins is widely recognized as one of the most important and influential jazz musicians. A number of his compositions\, including "St. Thomas"\, "Oleo"\, "Doxy"\, and "Airegin"\, have become jazz standards. Rollins was born in New York City\, to parents who were born in the United States Virgin Islands. Rollins received his first saxophone at age 13. He attended Benjamin Franklin High School in East Harlem. He said that a concert by Frank Sinatra there\, accompanied by a plea for racial harmony\, changed his life. His widely acclaimed album Saxophone Colossus was recorded on June 22\, 1956 at Rudy Van Gelder's studio in New Jersey\, with Tommy Flanagan on piano\, former Jazz Messengers bassist Doug Watkins and his favorite drummer Max Roach. This was Rollins' sixth recording as a leader and it included his best-known composition "St. Thomas"\, a Caribbean calypso based on a tune sung to him by his mother in his childhood\, as well as the fast bebop number "Strode Rode"\, and "Moritat" (the Kurt Weill composition also known as "Mack the Knife"). In 1957 he pioneered the use of bass and drums (without piano) as accompaniment for his saxophone solos. This texture came to be known as "strolling". Two early tenor/bass/drums trio recordings are Way Out West (Contemporary\, 1957) and A Night at the Village Vanguard (Blue Note\, 1957). Rollins uses the trio format intermittently throughout his career\, sometimes taking the unusual step of using his sax as a rhythm section instrument during bass and drum solos. Way Out West was so named because it was recorded for a California-based record label (with L.A. stalwart drummer Shelly Manne)\, and because the record included country and western songs such as "Wagon Wheels" and "I'm an Old Cowhand". The Village Vanguard CD consists of two sets\, a matinee with bassist Donald Bailey and drummer Pete LaRoca and then the evening set with bassist Wilbur Ware and drummer Elvin Jones. By 1959\, Rollins was frustrated with what he perceived as his own musical limitations and took the first -- and most famous -- of his musical sabbaticals. To spare a neighboring expectant mother the sound of his practice routine\, Rollins ventured to the Williamsburg Bridge to practice. Upon his return to the jazz scene in 1962 he named his "comeback" album The Bridge at the start of a contract with RCA Records\, recorded with a quartet featuring guitarist Jim Hall and still no piano. The rhythm section was Ben Riley on drums and bassist Bob Cranshaw. This became one of Rollins' best-selling records. Rollins took a sabbatical to study yoga\, meditation\, and Eastern philosophies. When he returned in 1972\, it was clear that he had become enamored of R&B\, pop\, and funk rhythms. His bands throughout the 1970s and 1980s featured electric guitar\, electric bass\, and usually more pop- or funk-oriented drummers. For most of this period he recorded for Milestone Records (The compilation Silver City: A Celebration of 25 Years on Milestone contains a selection from these years.) The 1970s and 1980s were not all disco though and it was during this period that Rollins' passion for unaccompanied saxophone solos came to the forefront. In 1985 he released The Solo Album. Critics such as Gary Giddins and Stanley Crouch have noted the disparity between Sonny Rollins the recording artist\, and Sonny Rollins the concert artist. In a May 2005 New Yorker profile\, Crouch wrote of Rollins the concert artist: "Over and over\, decade after decade\, from the late seventies through the eighties and nineties\, there he is\, Sonny Rollins\, the saxophone colossus\, playing somewhere in the world\, some afternoon or some eight o'clock somewhere\, pursuing the combination of emotion\, memory\, thought\, and aesthetic design with a command that allows him to achieve spontaneous grandiloquence. With its brass body\, its pearl-button keys\, its mouthpiece\, and its cane reed\, the horn becomes the vessel for the epic of Rollins' talent and the undimmed power and lore of his jazz ancestors."... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_Rollins   A link to this wonderful artists personal website: http://www.sonnyrollins.com/   Please Enjoy!

COL title VAL If I Fell COL performer VAL Barbara Casini Quartet	COL video title VAL Underground Sunshine - Bad Moon Rising (Creedence Clearwater Revival Cover) COL description VAL From '' Let There Be Light '' Label: Intrepid ‎-- IT 74003 Format: Vinyl\, LP\, Stereo Country: US Released: 1969  Tracklist A1 Birthday A2 All I Want Is You A3 Bad Moon Rising A4 Don't Let Me Down A5 Gimme Some Lovin' B1 Don't Shut Me Out B2 Proud Mary B3 Take Me\, Break Me  ------------------------  "Bad Moon Rising" is a song written by John Fogerty and performed by Creedence Clearwater Revival. It was the lead single from their album Green River and was released in April 1969\, four months before the album. The song reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart for three weeks in September 1969. It was CCR's second gold single.  The song has been recorded by at least 20 different artists\, in styles ranging from folk to reggae to psychedelic rock.  In 2011\, Rolling Stone ranked it #364 on its "500 Greatest Songs of All Time" list.  Composition  Fogerty reportedly wrote "Bad Moon Rising" after watching The Devil and Daniel Webster. Inspired by a scene in the film involving a hurricane\, Fogerty claims the song is about "the apocalypse that was going to be visited upon us."  Mondegreen  The refrain in the chorus\, "there's a bad moon on the rise\," is commonly misheard as "there's a bathroom on the right". Fogerty has parodied the mishearing in live performances of the song.  Cover versions  Jerry Lee Lewis released a version of the song on his 1973 album\, The Session.  Fogerty and Lewis recorded a version together that was released on Lewis' 2010 album\, Mean Old Man.  Emmylou Harris released a version of the song on her 1981 album\, Evangeline.  A 1986 version by the Australian band the Reels reached number 11 on the Australian charts.  The Scottish traditional group Battlefield Band recorded a version for their 1987 album After Hours: Forward to Scotland's Past.  Soundtrack  The song has been used in a number of films\, including: An American Werewolf in London\, My Fellow Americans\, Twilight Zone: The Movie\, Blade\, Sweet Home Alabama\, My Girl\, Man of the House\, Mr. Woodcock and The Big Chill.  It has also appeared in many television programs\, including: Supernatural\, Cold Case\, Northern Exposure and Alvin and the Chipmunks\, in which it is performed by the titular characters.  A remixed version of the song can be heard in the video game Crackdown 2.  The song was available as a playable song for Guitar Hero 5 series of music rhythm video games as downloadable content.  Rock Band Music Gaming Platform  The song was made available to download on March 1\, 2011 for use in the Rock Band 3 music gaming platform in both Basic rhythm\, and PRO mode which takes advantage of the use of a real guitar / bass guitar\, along with standard MIDI-compatible electronic drum kits / keyboards in addition to three-part harmony vocals.

Although all of these seven natural wonders are still in existence today\, and are still being adored by many tourists across the globe\, the New7Wonders Foundation launched a campaign in 2007 to select a new list of natural wonders. The declaration of the New Seven Natural Wonders of the World will take place in 2011.  The Following is CNN list of seven breathtaking wonders of the world created by nature itself\, in random order:  1. Magical dancing lights\, performing through the night! -- AURORA BOREALIS (Alaska) 2. A thousand tiny islands in one mountain cupped bay\, no way! -- HARBOR OF RIO DE JANEIRO (Brazil) 3. A canyon so vast\, and carved out of the past! -- GRAND CANYON (USA) 4. A giant coral reef\, with fish beyond belief! -- GREAT BARRIER REEF (Australia) 5.  A mountain so high it almost reaches the sky! -- MOUNT EVEREST (Himalayas) 6.  A volcano that grew\, nearly right in front of you! -- PARICUTIN VOLCANO (Mexico) 7.  Falls so tall\, a dinosaur would feel small! - VICTORIA FALLS (South Africa)       ~Planetpals~ ---------------------------------------------------- DADDY'S LOVE (an acrostic poem)  Daddy's love\, so beautiful Aurora\, you're colorful\, but not as wonderful Daddy's love\, can never be detached Deep Grand Canyon\, you're so vast\, but not a match  Yesterdays\, today and into tomorrows Surpassing all sorrow 'though times are borrowed Love of Daddy\, so solid\, like Mount Kilimanjaro Only his love is indestructible and so magical Victoria Falls\, you're fantastic\, but you don't have his magic  Endless love and wind beneath my wings\, that's my Daddy!  ~I love you\, Daddy! Happy Father's Day - From WhiteLibraTexas~ ----------------------------------------------------------  I picked the featured song\, "Wind Beneath My Wings\," to dedicate to the coolest father on earth\, my Daddy\, and to all the wonderful fathers across the globe\, too. This song describes my feelings for my Daddy\, very perfectly.    This beautiful song has been recorded by many popular artists\, to include Roger Whittaker\, Gladys Knight\, Lou Rawls\, B.J.

Schweigend geht die Belegschaft aufs Klo Zählend\, wie viele Krümel Gnädig vom Herrntisch gefall'n  Stille Nacht\, heilige Nacht! Falscher Trost! Oh\, wie lacht Der Direktor mit randvollem Mund! Singt uns gnädig zu göttlicher Stund: "Arbeitsfriede auf Erden!" -- Wir fallen mal wieder drauf rein!  Billige Nacht\, eilige Nacht -- Ratenkauf\, leichtgemacht Durch der Engel Alleluja! Die gehören zum Werbe-Etat Denn der Vater im Himmel Ist Präsident vom Konzern!  Stille Nacht\, heilige Nacht -- Lichterbaum angemacht Und ein liebliches Liedlein gesingt! Und ein Eierlikörchen getrinkt -- Und die Kinder geprügelt Bis sie hübsch andächtig sind!  Gute Nacht\, peinliche Nacht -- Fernsehspiel ausgemacht Und im Magen ein flaues Gefühl Weil die Liebe nicht hochkommen will! Noch zwei Nächte zum Schlafen -- Dann wieder rinn in' Betrieb!  Stille Nacht\, heilige Nacht -- Weihnachtszeit rumgebracht! Großes Gähnen im Portemonnaie -- Überstunden tun immer noch weh! Falscher Frieden auf Erden Feierten wir mit den Herrn!  Wilde Nacht\, streikende Nacht! Eines Tag's\, nicht ganz sacht Pfeifen wir auf die Gnade der Herrn Übernimmt mal das Volk den Konzern Und die Führung im Staate -- Das wird ein Weihnachtsfest wer'n!

COL title VAL It's So Peaceful in the Country COL performer VAL Mildred Bailey with The Delta Rhythm Boys	COL video title VAL Don\, Dick and Jimmy - Love is a Many-Splendored Thing (1955) COL description VAL Charted at #96 on Billboard Hot 100 in December 1955. This is very likely the most obscure charting version of this song. Don\, Dick and Jimmy had one other entry on the Hot 100; "That's What I Like" at #14 in October 1954. Song is the theme of the 1955 movie of the same name\, starring Jennifer Jones and William Holden. Also #1 for the Four Aces in August 1955\, #54 for David Rose and His Orchestra in November 1955\, #26 for Don Cornell in November 1955 and #79 for Woody Herman and His Orchestra in November 1955. Later\, it charted at #32 on the Adult Contemporary chart for Barry Manilow in 2006. I have also posted the Don Cornell and David Rose versions.  Original Billboard review: "The pretty flick tune\, coming along strongly via the Four Aces disk\, gets a solid pop-type performance here." Billboard rating: 73 out of 100.  Written by Sammy Fain & Paul Francis Webster.   B-side is "In Madrid". COL channel name VAL CatsPjamas1	0

COL title VAL You Really Got Me COL performer VAL Denmark + Winter	COL video title VAL Bud and Travis -- They Call the Wind Maria COL description VAL Bud & Travis began recording together in 1958; Edmonson was related to Colin Edmonson\, whom Dashiell had met while serving in the Korean War.  Travis Edmonson had previously been a member of the Gateway Singers. They released ten albums and toured widely before splitting in 1965\, becoming significant musicians on the folk revival circuit. Edmonson and Dashiell reportedly had frequent clashes\, and the duo separated from 1960-63. During this period Dashiell put out several records with The Kinsmen\, and Edmonson put out several solo albums. Dashiell went solo after their final breakup in 1965\, putting out a solo album in 1968. He taught late in life\, and died in 1989 as a result of a brain tumor. Edmonson toured regularly in the 1970s as a solo act. He died on May 9\, 2009.  iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/es/album/bud-and-travis-1959/id833528283  Síguenos en: Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/vintagem.es Spotify: http://open.spotify.com/user/vintagemusic Web: http://www.vintagemusic.es BoutiqAlia: http://boutiqalia.com/store/vintage/ (compra física de CD) Compra nuestros Cd's en formato físico en estas plataformas: Ebay:  http://stores.ebay.com/VintageMusicFm BoutiqAlia: www.boutiqalia-vintagemusic.com Síguenos en: Spotify: https://goo.gl/raouHQ Facebook: https://goo.gl/L92BHL Instagram: https://goo.gl/3oYDGH Web: http://www.vintagemusic.es   Compra nuestros Cd's en formato físico en estas plataformas: Ebay:  http://stores.ebay.com/VintageMusicFm BoutiqAlia: www.boutiqalia-vintagemusic.com Discogs: https://www.discogs.com/es/seller/vintagemusicfm/profile COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm	0

The cafe was owned by John and Vera Richter\, German immigrants who followed a Naturmensch and Lebensreform philosophy influenced by the Wandervogel movement in Germany.Their followers\, known as "Nature Boys"\, wore long hair and beards and ate only raw fruits and vegetables. McGrew adopted the philosophy and chose the name "eden ahbez"\, writing and spelling his name with lower-case letters. It was there while living in a cave near Palm Springs\, ahbez wrote "Nature Boy". Partly autobiographical\, the song was a tribute to his mentor Bill Pester\, who had originally introduced him to Naturmensch and Lebensreform.  In 1947\, at the prompting of Cowboy Jack Patton and Johnny Mercer\, ahbez approached Nat King Cole's manager backstage at the Lincoln Theater in Los Angeles\, handed him a tattered copy of "Nature Boy"\, and asked him to show it to Cole. However his pleas were ignored and a disappointed ahbez left the sheet music of "Nature Boy" with Cole's valet\, Otis Pollard. From him Cole came to know of the song and after reading it\, the singer loved it and began playing "Nature Boy" for live audiences to much acclaim. Irving Berlin\, who was present in the crowd\, had initially offered to buy the track from Cole. But he decided to record the track for himself and needed to get permission from ahbez before releasing it as a single. After ahbez was discovered living under the Hollywood Sign\, Cole got his permission and recorded the song COL channel name VAL nyronut	1

COL title VAL Choo Choo Ch'boogie COL performer VAL Billy Mure	COL video title VAL Choo Choo Ch'Boogie - Tim Timebomb and Friends COL description VAL Louis Jordan and the Tympany Five was a BIG time R&B\, jazz and dance band\, put together by Jordan in 1938. They had a smokin' rhythm and horn section. This one was done in 1946. It spent 18 weeks on top of the R&B charts\, and peaked at number seven on the national chart. The band AND this song were a big hit with everyone. The tune is a jump blues\, that was written by country songwriters Denver Darling\, who was known as a "hillbilly" songwriter and guitarist\, and Vaughn Horton\, who wrote a hit called "Mockin' Bird Hill"\, and Milt Gabler\, who ran Decca Records\, and was Louis Jordan's record producer.  Even though the song came out in the 40's\, (a decade before rock and roll happened) it's a predecessor. And\, because of all those wonderful influences of Country\, Jazz and R&B\, in it\, the record could be on the list for being one of the first rock and roll songs.

COL title VAL Beyond the Sea COL performer VAL Tex Beneke and His Orchestra	COL video title VAL Shirley Bassey - Johnny One Note (1976 Show #1) COL description VAL 1976 (Shirley performs this classic Rodgers & Hart Big Band Style Number 'Johnny One Note' with her own uniquely powerful style\, which is from the Musical 'Babes In Arms\,'  Shirley performed this song on her 1976 TV Variety Show.  Shirley recorded and released this song on her 1966 LP titled\, 'Shirley Bassey - I've Got A Song For You'.  ABOUT Johnny One Note: "Johnny One Note" is a 1937 show tune from the 1937 Rodgers and Hart musical Babes in Arms\, where it was introduced by Wynn Murrary. Judy Garland sang it in the film version\, released in 1939.  The musical contained more great songs Shirley Bassey has also performed: "The Lady Is A Tramp"\, "Where Or When" and "My Funny Valentine".  The 'Babes In Arms' story is about a group of vaudevillians who want to revive their old fashioned form of entertainement by doing a roadshow. "Johnny One Note" is sung as a bedtimestory. A kind of fairy tale about a very ego-centred singer who is so very loud that nobody can hear the soprano. This lady singer asks her godmother to put a spell on Johnny\, so that the next time he wants to impress everybody by holding his note as long as possible he has to held it forever.  Shirley Bassey wrote about "Johnny One Note":   I don't always recognize the right songs for me the first time I hear them. For a long time I was asked to do 'Johnny One Note'\, but I couldn't do it for many\, many years. Then one day Eddie Fisher's musical director just sat at the piano and said\, 'This is a good song for you'\, and started playing 'Johnny One Note'. The way he played it\, I got so excited\, but I said 'I can't do this song'. 'Why not?' he asked. 'Well\, when I was discovered\, the girl whose place I took in the show\, she had a big hit with this song and I've never been able to touch this song.' 'Well\, try it\,' he said. And I was amazed when I opened my mouth: this voice came out singing this song as though it was mine. So\, after all those years - it was about ten years\, I believe - when we actually got down to it\, it was a piece of cake.  LYRICS: Johnny could only sing one note  And the note he sang was this: aaaahh  Poor Johnny One Note  Sang out with Gusto A nd just overloaded the place Poor Johnny One Note  Yelled willy-nilly  Until he was blue in the face For holding one note was his ace  Couldn't hear the brass  Couldn't hear the drum He was in a class  By himself\, by gum Poor Johnny One Note  Got in Aida indeed a great chance to be brave He took his one note  Howled like the North Wind  Brought forth wind that made critics rave While Verdi turned round in his grave  Couldn't hear the flute  Or the big trombone Everyone was mute  Johnny stood alone Cats and dogs stopped yapping  Lions in the zoo  Were all jealous of Johnny's big thrill Thunderclaps stopped clapping  Traffic ceased its roar  And they tell us Niag'ra stood still He stopped the trainwistles  Boatwhistles  Steamwhistles  Copwhistles All whistles bowed to his skill  Sing Johnny One Note Sing out with gusto  And just overwhelm all the crowd  Aaaahh   So sing\, Johnny One Note out loud  Sing\, Johnny One Note  Sing -  Johnny -  One Note -  Out loud  ABOUT the LP\, I've Got A Song For You: I've Got a Song for You is a 1966 album by Shirley Bassey. Bassey had left EMI's Columbia Label\, and this was her first album for United Artists\, a label she would remain with for approximately 14 years. This album and the following release And We Were Lovers were produced by Bassey's former husband\, Kenneth Hume. (Their marriage had ended in divorce in 1965\, but he continued to act as her manager\, and for these two albums\, her producer.) The album entered the UK Albums Chart at #26\, but only remained on the chart for one week\, and failed to chart in the US\, despite her having received outstanding reviews for live engagements in New York and Las Vegas that same year\, and the fact that the album was recorded in New York.

Em Angola\, também é conhecido porm'bolumbumba e é utilizado entre os quimbundos\, ovambos\, nyanekas\, humbise khoisan[2]. Este instrumento foi levado pelos escravos angolanos para o Brasil\, onde é utilizado para acompanhar uma dança/luta acrobática chamada capoeira[1]. No sul de Moçambique\, tem o nome de xitende. No Brasil\, também é conhecido por urucungo\, urucurgo\, orucungo\, oricungo\,uricungo\, rucungo\, ricungo\, berimbau metalizado\, gobo\, marimbau\,bucumbumba\, bucumbunga\, gunga\, macungo\, matungo\, mutungo\,aricongo\, arco musical e rucumbo. O instrumento é conhecido por ser tema de uma canção popular de Baden Powell de Aquino\, grande violonista brasileiro. A letra da música foi escrita por Vinícius de Moraes. Considerado um dos maiores percussionistas do planeta\, Naná Vasconcelos especializou-se em instrumentos brasileiros\, em especial o berimbau\, inclusive expandindo a sua técnica. Preservado na Bahia até o presente\, o berimbau sempre foi um souvenir típico do estado\, vendido aos turistas muito mais como adorno que como instrumento - colorido e enfeitado\, bem diferente daquele que os capoeiristas utilizam. Berimbau Vinicius de Moraes Quem é homem de bem Não trai! O amor que lhe quer Seu bem! Quem diz muito que vai Não vai! Assim como não vai Não vem!... Quem de dentro de si Não sai! Vai morrer sem amar Ninguém! O dinheiro de quem Não dá! É o trabalho de quem Não tem! Capoeira que é bom Não cai! E se um dia ele cai Cai bem!... Capoeira me mandou Dizer que já chegou Chegou para lutar Berimbau me confirmou Vai ter briga de amor Tristeza camará... Se não tivesse o amor (2x) Se não tivesse essa dor (2x) E se não tivesse o sofrer (2x) E se não tivesse o chorar (2x) Melhor era tudo se acabar (2x) Eu amei\, amei demais O que eu sofri por causa de amor ninguém sofreu Eu chorei\, perdi a paz Mas o que eu sei é que ninguém nunca teve mais... Mais do que eu Capoeira me mandou Dizer que já chegou Chegou para lutar Berimbau me confirmou Vai ter briga de amor Tristeza camará (Vídeo de Antônio Augusto dos Santos -- antaugsan -- Bocaiuva\, Divinópolis -- MG -- 1/10/2012) COL channel name VAL Antônio Bocaiúva	0

This is proven true\, given the fact that I recently discovered her albums—and I just haven't had my fill. I've searched and purchased everything I could find from such a gifted songstress. Lorez crafts each lyric with such grace and tonality that could easily match (if not surpass) the reigning jazz stylists of the bop/jazz/pop age. She gives each standard a new sense of evocative meaning as far as lyrics are concerned\, and reinvents the wheel each time she unleashes her enthralling voice. As she once said "A lyric is dead\, until you breathe life into it." This is exactly what she does. Enjoy and listen in HD\, to the lovely—Lorez Alexandria.

COL title VAL Als een vrouw COL performer VAL Ernst Jansz	COL video title VAL Someone To Watch Over Me By Enoch Light COL description VAL Enoch Light was a classical violinist\, bandleader\, and recording engineer who was a pioneer of early stereo excellence.  He would go to extreme lengths to create high-quality recordings that took full advantage of current state of the art equipment.  He pioneered stereo effects that bounced the sounds between the right and left channels (often described as "ping-pong").  He arranged his musicians in ways to produce the kinds of recorded sounds he wished to achieve\, the first to do so.   His ensemble of studio musicians was frequently referred to as The Light Brigade.  The first of the his albums\, Persuasive Percussion\, became the first huge hit based solely on record sales.  His songs received little or no airplay on the radio\, because AM radio\, the standard of the day\, was monaural.  He released several albums in the Persuasive Percussion series\, as well as a Command test record.  He doubled the size of his album sleeves but enabled it to fold like a book\, thus inventing the gatefold-packaging format.   The gatefold sleeve became extremely popular in later decades\, and was used on albums such as The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  He pioneered many recording techniques such as the use of 35 mm film soundtrack instead of magnetic tape.  Recording on 35 mm film soundtrack reduced the effects of "wow" and "flutter"\, common in early stereo recordings.   The recordings were released under the "35MM" series\, starting from "Stereo 35-MM" released by Command Records.   Musicians who appeared on his albums include Doc Severinsen\, Tony Mottola\, Dick Hyman\, and arranger Lew Davies.    In 1965\, he sold the Command record label to ABC\, who began using the label for their lesser quality releases.  He continued recording after the sale of Command with a new label called Project 3\, but did not concentrate so heavily on stereo effects.  Enoch Light And The Light Brigade\, using the original scores\, released albums of the hits of the big band era\, keeping the arrangements as close to the original as possible.

COL title VAL You Came a Long Way from St. Louis COL performer VAL Perry Como	COL video title VAL Paul Mauriat: ♫ L'Amour est bleu (Love is Blue) ♫ COL description VAL Sucesso de Paul Mauriat e sua orquestra em 1968\, "L'Amour est bleu" ("Love is Blue")  é uma composição de Pierre Cour e André Popp\, que a gravou originalmente em 1967. A canção foi enorme sucesso não só na França\, mas também em vários países do mundo\, e recebeu inúmeras gravações\, como as de Caravelli\, Claudine Longet\, Clementine\, Gabor Szabo\, Jeff Beck\, Los Indios Trabajaras\, Michel Fugain\, Michele Torr\, Ray Conniff\, Richard Clayderman\, Sandpipers\, Santo and Johnny\, The Dells\, Vicky Leandros e outros. No Brasil foram registrações versões\, intituladas "O amor é azul"\,  de Clara Nunes\, Celly Campello\, Luiz Loy e seu Conjunto e The Jordans. A gravação de Paul Mauriat é o principal hit da carreira deste orquestrador francês nascido em 4 de março de 1925 em Marselha.  O talento de Paul Mauriat é hereditário. Era filho de uma família de músicos\, tendo seu pai como primeiro mestre. Aos quatro anos\, iniciou seus estudos de piano. Aos dez\, entra para o Conservatório de Paris\, saindo quatro anos mais tarde decidido a seguir a carreira de concertista. O encontro com o jazz\, entretanto\, muda os planos iniciais do artista. O novo ritmo decididamente influencia o estilo que o tornaria famoso em todo o mundo.  Mauriat cresceu em Paris e aos dezessete anos\, organiza sua própria orquestra\, apresentando-se em cabarés e teatros na França e em outros países da Europa. Na década de 50\, tornou-se o arranjador preferido de vários cantores franceses\, entre os quais se destaca a figura de Charles Aznavour. Fã da Música Popular Brasileira\, Mauriat gravou clássicos como Casa no campo (Zé Rodrix - Tavito)\, Amada amante (Roberto Carlos - Erasmo Carlos)\, Presepada (Antonio Carlos - Jocafi)\, Naquela mesa (Sergio Bittencourt)\, Viagem (J.de Aquino - Paulo César Pinheiro) e outros.  Ele se retirou da profissão em 1998\, num último show em Osaka\, Japão. Mas a orquestra ainda faz shows pelo mundo\, e inclusive fez duas viagens para a China. Em 2002 o escritor e perito na vida do maestro\, Serge Elhaik lançou uma biografia autorizada escrita em francês\, que se chama "Une vie en Bleu". Esta biografia contém valiosas informações sobre a discografia de Mauriat e muitas fotos dele e de sua orquestra. Nos últimos meses de vida\, o maestro ficou residindo em sua casa de verão na cidade de Perpignan. Foi internado no hospital da cidade\, muito fraco e\, após 2 dias internado\, a 1 da manhã do dia 3 de Novembro (horário local) de 2006\, Paul Mauriat faleceu aos 81 anos.

COL title VAL Wicked Game COL performer VAL Sonos	COL video title VAL Bessie Smith -- Baby Won't You Please Come Home 1923 COL description VAL Bessie Smith -- Baby Won't You Please Come Home 1923  Bessie Smith (1892 or 1894 --1937) was the most popular and successful female American blues singer of the 1920s and 1930s\, and a strong influence on subsequent generations\, including Billie Holiday\, Mahalia Jackson\, Dinah Washington\, Nina Simone and Janis Joplin. This is one of her first recordings in 1923 with pianist Clarence Williams. In no other way than living the kind of violent\, hard-drinking street life she sang about\, could Bessie Smith have inspired in her audiences the powerful empathy that ultimately won her the title\, "Empress of the Blues." Throughout her career\, Bessie was respected for being a strong\, independent African-American woman with tremendous talent and determination. She expressed great pride in her culture\, and gladly participated in its earthy pleasures\, regularly indulging her taste for alcohol and sex to extremes. How ever much others tried to run roughshod over her\, Bessie refused to submit to the slightest abuse without a knock-down\, drag-out fight. With few exceptions\, she held to her musical ideals with equal tenacity. Though musically illiterate\, she regularly collaborated with her pianists to compose and write down her music and her words frequently touched on pertinent events in her life. Her performance style\, too\, derives considerably from her own personal and cultural attributes. (first posted on ilbofilms feb 24 2008; 492 views) COL channel name VAL Henri Erwig	0

It was the lead single from their album Green River and was released in April 1969\, four months before the album. The song reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart for three weeks in September 1969. It was CCR's second gold single.  The song has been recorded by at least 20 different artists\, in styles ranging from folk to reggae to psychedelic rock.  In 2011\, Rolling Stone ranked it #364 on its "500 Greatest Songs of All Time" list.  Composition  Fogerty reportedly wrote "Bad Moon Rising" after watching The Devil and Daniel Webster. Inspired by a scene in the film involving a hurricane\, Fogerty claims the song is about "the apocalypse that was going to be visited upon us."  Mondegreen  The refrain in the chorus\, "there's a bad moon on the rise\," is commonly misheard as "there's a bathroom on the right". Fogerty has parodied the mishearing in live performances of the song.  Cover versions  Jerry Lee Lewis released a version of the song on his 1973 album\, The Session.  Fogerty and Lewis recorded a version together that was released on Lewis' 2010 album\, Mean Old Man.  Emmylou Harris released a version of the song on her 1981 album\, Evangeline.  A 1986 version by the Australian band the Reels reached number 11 on the Australian charts.  The Scottish traditional group Battlefield Band recorded a version for their 1987 album After Hours: Forward to Scotland's Past.  Soundtrack  The song has been used in a number of films\, including: An American Werewolf in London\, My Fellow Americans\, Twilight Zone: The Movie\, Blade\, Sweet Home Alabama\, My Girl\, Man of the House\, Mr. Woodcock and The Big Chill.  It has also appeared in many television programs\, including: Supernatural\, Cold Case\, Northern Exposure and Alvin and the Chipmunks\, in which it is performed by the titular characters.  A remixed version of the song can be heard in the video game Crackdown 2.  The song was available as a playable song for Guitar Hero 5 series of music rhythm video games as downloadable content.  Rock Band Music Gaming Platform  The song was made available to download on March 1\, 2011 for use in the Rock Band 3 music gaming platform in both Basic rhythm\, and PRO mode which takes advantage of the use of a real guitar / bass guitar\, along with standard MIDI-compatible electronic drum kits / keyboards in addition to three-part harmony vocals.

It was written in 1949 in support of the progressive movement\, and was first recorded by The Weavers\, a folk music quartet composed of Seeger\, Hays\, Ronnie Gilbert and Fred Hellerman\, and then by Peter\, Paul and Mary.  Early versions  The song was not particularly successful when it was first released\, likely due in part to the political climate of the time. It fared notably better when it was recorded by Peter\, Paul and Mary more than a decade later. Their cover of the song\, released in August 1962\, became a Top 10 hit.  Other versions  The song has since been recorded by dozens of major artists\, including a version by Trini Lopez on his 1963 album Trini Lopez at PJ's\, which reached No. 3 in the USA\, as well as one by Leonard Nimoy\, which appeared on his 1968 release The Way I Feel. Australian folk group The Seekers also performed the song\, and recorded it in 1963.  A more recent example is the reggae-style cover released by BBC personality Handy Andy\, which was not particularly well received.  French popstar Claude François released his cover "Si j'avais un marteau" ("If I had a Hammer") in November 1963.  The French vocal group Les Surfs released another cover "Si j'avais un marteau" in a version faithful to that of Trini Lopez  Italian popstar Rita Pavone sang "Datemi un martello" ("Give me a hammer") in 1963\, using the theme but without any political overtones.  Chilean Folk Artist Víctor Jara also sang a 1969 cover titled "El Martillo" ("The hammer") on his album Pongo En Tus Manos Abiertas.  Jamaican Toaster U-Roy recorded a very violent version of the song called "Hammering" in 1972  Nicaraguan singer\, song writer and composer Hernaldo Zúñiga\, also made a cover version in Spanish for the Mexican group "Fandango" titled "Dame Aquel Martillo"\, this one was released in 1991.  Israeli singer Geula Gil also made a cover version in Hebrew.  Another version can be found on Kidsongs video and DVD\, "Yankee Doodle Boy (AKA Sing Out America)".  Another version of the song was recorded by AC/DC's lead singer Brian Johnson.  Sam Cooke recorded the song in concert.  The Von Trapp Children also recorded their version for their vol. 2 CD.  Waldemar Matuška Kladivo (czech Hammer)  Legacy  The song "If I Had a Hammer" was a Civil Rights anthem of the American Civil Rights movement.  It also was a common selection for "folk masses" in Roman Catholic Churches.[citation needed]  Wikileaks has chosen it as their "Wikileaks song".  In popular culture  Hall of Fame baseball player Hank Aaron\, whose nicknames included "Hammerin' Hank" and "The Hammer"\, titled his autobiography\, I Had a Hammer.  "If I Had a Hammer" is a fourth season episode of Dexter in which the eponymous character is investigating a serial killer's use of a hammer.  "If I Had a Tail-Hammer" is a second season episode of Digimon.  Peter\, Paul & Mary's version of the song is used in the film Confessions of a Dangerous Mind during a sequence in which "Gong Show" host Chuck Barris (Sam Rockwell) has an on-air nervous breakdown due to his years as a CIA assassin\, and visualizes the entire audience as dead bodies.  In May 2005\, colleagues of then-House Majority Leader Tom DeLay sang "If I Had a Hammer" at a dinner held in support of him during the investigation that eventually led to his indictment on charges of money laundering and conspiracy to violate election law. The song was chosen in reference to his nickname "The Hammer." On The Daily Show\, Jon Stewart joked about the dissonance between the song's progressive history and DeLay's conservative politics\, saying\, "If Tom DeLay actually had a hammer\, he would bludgeon Pete Seeger to death."  "If Al Had a Hammer" is a sixth season episode of Married... with Children. Also\, in a fifth season episode\, "You Better Shop Around\, Part I"\, Marcy tells Al: We sang our favorite folk songs like\, "If I Had A Hammer\, I'd Drive It Through Al Bundy's Skull".  "Steve's Hammer (For Pete)" by Steve Earle references Seeger's song through its title and its content  Israeli hip-hop band "Hadag Nahash" based its top-chart single "אף אחד" ("Nobody") on the song.

"iron Man" is available on 7" vinyl: http://shop.tapeterecords.com/hellsongs-iron-man-7-vinyl.html  HELLSONGS about "Iron Man":  "Iron Man must be one of the first guitar riffs I tried to copy on guitar. Easy but yet doomy and totally cool in the way that you just want to play it over and over again. This was probably one of the roughest songs ever to wrestle down for Hellsongs and there are many x-rated versions in the secret drawer. This since our idea never have been to just copy the original straight away.  Thanks to Johan Reivén\, one of the producers\, I kept throwing and re-building and I´m very happy that we all had the patience to let it grow. Hellsongs have never before released such a monstrous track\, always keeping it quite gentle and lo-fi. Well\, this new approach is more or less the red line this time\, not bothering about how we have done things in the past. This track needed drums\, bass and a whole lot more - so be it!  The video was shot in a very cosy but almost never used public space in Majorna\, Göteborg. The actors are friends and neighbours of Hellbender thus the finest beings alive. It was a true pleasure to watch them perform and work together with the talented video team. The director called us up late 2012\, stating that he wanted to do a video with Hellsongs. It´s always very fun and interesting when someone chases us\, instead of the opposite. Usually they are nutcases but Ronn Elfors Lipsker is quite the opposite\, which this video clearly shows.  His strong idea was to use a metal gimmick of some kind (it turned out to be the Kiss make up) to show how identity can be based in a music genre. In my own case\, metal was a big core of my self confidence and self esteem when I grew up. It made me strong enough to cope with some really tough situations. As I grew up\, that has been more and more internalized and I do not longer have the need to show that I´m a metal head to keep my cool up. We had great fun doing the video and I really think the actors are great\, especially if you consider the age of the youngsters!  The funniest part was that we hadn´t found any oldtimers until the day we finally shot the video. There was this gang of the local skid row\, hanging out in the park while we were shooting the last parts\, so I asked the director if he felt ok working with some of them. He was totally cool with it\, so I just walked up to them and succeded with convincing them to be a part of the video. After a while they hooked up with us and oh boy\, you could easily tell how much they enjoyed that!  http://www.tapeterecords.de/artists/hellsongs/ http://www.hellsongs.com/ COL channel name VAL Tapete Records	0

COL title VAL The Letter COL performer VAL Classics IV	COL video title VAL Ferrante and Teicher -   Tie A Yellow Ribbon COL description VAL "Endeavour to play easy pieces well and with elegance; that is better than to play difficult pieces badly." ― Robert Schumann ▼▼▼  FERRANTE AND TEICHER Ferrante & Teicher were a duo of American piano players\, known for their light arrangements of familiar classical pieces\, movie soundtracks\, show tunes and popsongs. Arthur Ferrante and Louis Teicher met while studying at the Juilliard School of Music in New York.  Musical prodigies\, they began performing as a piano duo while still in school. After graduating\, they both joined the Juilliard faculty. In 1947\, they launched a full-time concert career\, at first playing nightclubs\, then quickly moving up to playing classical music with orchestral backing.  Between 1950 and 1980\, they were a major American easy listening act\, and scored four big U.S. hits: "Theme From The Apartment" \, "Theme From Exodus" \, "Tonight" \, and "Midnight Cowboy" . They performed and recorded regularly with pops orchestras popular standards by George Gershwin\, Jerome Kern\, Cole Porter\, Richard Rodgers and others. In 1973\, they did the Hollywood Radio Theater theme for the Rod Serling radio drama series\, The Zero Hour. Both men were initiated as honorary members of Tau Kappa Epsilon at Central State University (now University of Central Oklahoma) while on tour. Ferrante and Teicher ceased performing in 1989 and retired to Longboat Key and Siesta Key\, respectively\, both close to each other on the west coast of Florida. They continued to play together occasionally at a local piano store. CDs of their music\, some of it not previously released\, have continued to appear.  TIE A YELLOW RIBBON "Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree"  was written by Irwin Levine and L. Russell Brown and was a worldwide hit for the group "Dawn" (featuring Tony Orlando)  in 1973.   The origin of the idea of a yellow ribbon as remembrance may have been the 19th century practice that some women allegedly had of wearing a yellow ribbon in their hair to signify their devotion to a husband or sweetheart serving in the U.S. Cavalry. The song "'Round Her Neck She Wears a Yeller Ribbon"\, which later inspired the John Wayne movie "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"\, is a reference to this. The symbol of a yellow ribbon became widely known in civilian life in the 1970s as a reminder that an absent loved one\, either in the military or in jail\, would be welcomed home on their return.  MHO A beautiful "full body" arrangement of this famous seventies pop theme with the piano's of Ferrante and Teicher backed up by a large orchestra.  Some really enjoyable and unexpected counterpart melodies with both the brass and the strings coming out equally surprising.   The "knacky" rhythm that can be heard in the background adds to the listening pleasure.   Have fun and enjoy ! COL channel name VAL Socratess2007	0

Rumour has it that The Squires were ousted out of their position as Tom's band when Jones was offered his lucrative TV show in the States\,seems thay wanted Tom and not the Boys in the band. To placate them\, Manager Gordon Mills offered them the chance of stardom with this cover.Joe South went on to score the big trans atlantic hit and Freddy Weller(of Paul Revere and The Raiders) took his pedal steel laden version to the top of the Country Charts later that year. The Squires? - When this flopped they went their seperate ways.Still love that guitar though!!! COL channel name VAL mrrayjd	1

He was known as "The Sentimental Gentleman of Swing"\, due to his smooth-toned trombone playing. He was the younger brother of bandleader Jimmy Dorsey.[  After Dorsey broke with his brother in the mid-1930s\, he led an extremely popular and highly successful band from the late 1930s into the 1950s. In 1934 the Dorsey Brothers band signed with Decca records\, having a hit with "I Believe In Miracles".Future bandleader Glenn Millerwas a member of the Dorsey Brothers Orchestra in 1934 and 1935\, composing "Annie's Cousin Fanny" and "Dese Dem Dose" both recorded for Decca for the band. Ongoing acrimony between the brothers\, however\, led to Tommy Dorsey's walking out to form his own band in 1935\, just as the orchestra was having a hit with "Every Little Moment." Destacan temas como "I´m Getting Sentimental Over You"\, "Marie"\, "The Big Apple"\, "Music\, Maestro\, Please"\, "I´ll Never Smile Again"\, "This Love of Mine"\, "On the Sunny Side of the Street"\, "T.D.´s Boogie Woogie"\, "Well\, Git ´It"\, "Opus One"\, "Manhattan Serenade" y "There Are Such Things"\, entre muchos otros.

COL title VAL In My Room COL performer VAL Sagittarius	COL video title VAL Robert Palmer - Don't Explain (Billie Holiday / Arthur Herzog's Cover) [Audio HQ] COL description VAL "Don't Explain" beautiful cover made it by Robert Palmer that you can find in his homonymous Lp of 1990. This song is surely one of the most amazing that he made on this album. Good Listening.  1990's  Don't  Explain  lp finds Robert Palmer in an ambitious  mood\, attempting  to highlight  both  his love of world  music and jazz standards  on an album  featuring  trademark  hard  rock. Essentially\, this 18  song collection comes across like three separate mini albums\, lacking a sense of cohesiveness when played as a whole\, a jarring juxtoposition of divergent musical styles instead of one record. However\, there are plenty of gems among the 18 tracks featured. Palmer showcases his love for African influenced melodies with the uptempo "Housework"\, complete with clever humorous lyrics\, and does a credible reggae version of Bob Dylan's "I'll Be Your Babt Tonight" with help from UB40 believe it or not. Actually\, that song was a major hit single in the UK!! The first third of the album is dominated by the rock material\, especially on the fast paced guitar driven metal songs "You're Mother Should Have Told You" and "Can't Get Enough Of A Good Thing". The highlight  is a rock  power ballad version of Otis Redding's "Dreams To Remember" where Palmer has to flex some vocal muscle and invoke some soul not present in the faster paced rock  songs. "You're Amazing" is a pleasant rocker (and a Top 40 US Hit Single)\, milder than the previous mentioned songs and similair to the singer's 1988 hit "Simply Irresistible"\, although not as good. The last third of this set sees the singer in full romance mode\, alternating between inspired original compositions such as "Aeroplane" and "Not A Word" and Palmer's own take of classic bits such as "You're So Desirable". The first two feature excellent string arrangements and show Palmer capable of conveying emotion vocally without being over the top while the latter plays to his vocal strengths with a more happy lyric and upbeat tempo. The title track is a Bille Holiday standard where Palmer's subtle\, understated vocals strongly convey the emotions of longing and pain expressed in the lyrics. In between it all is a unique medley of 2 Marvin Gaye hits\, "Mercy Mercy Me" and "I Want You"\, where the singer literally creates a whole new song\, using the pain and anguish over a world going bad from Gaye's powerful environmental ode as the bridge into a lyrical pleading for a chance at romance from Gaye's second number. Sticking with an arrangement culled largely from the first song\, the lyrics provide near perfect segue and Palmer raises the bar with some of his most powerful vocalizing in the song's second half. It's little wonder this song was a major hit single in both the US and UK\, arguably the best known song in this collection. Overall\, there are a good 12-14 songs in this set that would make a really good Robert Palmer record\, the problem here isn't that there isn't enough\, it's that there is a bit too much. Still a good buy\, with a lot of interesting material alongside some enjoyable guitar driven rock songs. In fact\, Palmer recruits Steve Stevens from Billy Idol's band to assist on some of the more edgy material\, an excellent choice. Robert Palmer fans will definately enjoy.

A6 Chante A7 Rosbeef Attack B1 La Nuit Le Jour B2 Tout Est Fini B3 Tes Yeux B4 Tu Perds Ton Temps B5 Trop Sage B6 Debbie Merci B7 Froggies Strike Back!  ------------------------  "All Day and All of the Night" is a song by the British band The Kinks from 1964. It reached #2 on the UK Singles Chart and #7 on the United States Charts. Like their previous hit "You Really Got Me"\, the song relies on a simple sliding power chord riff\, although this song's riff is slightly more complicated\, incorporating a B Flat after the chords F and G. Otherwise\, the recordings are similar in beat and structure\, with similar background vocals\, progressions\, and guitar solos. In 2003 it appeared as #57 on Pure Pop's list of The 100 Best Singles of All. The guitar solo break by Dave Davies is truly inspired and difficult to copy\, and deemed to be so excellent that for many years it was claimed that Jimmy Page played the break - however\, it has been documented\, and confirmed by Ray Davies\, that Dave made up and played the solo himself\, accidentally augmenting the unique riff by playing it through an amp with a hole in it. Time.  Cover versions  The Stranglers made a cover in 1988\, reaching #7 in the UK singles charts. The Remains also did a cover of the song. It can be found on their album\, "A Session with The Remains". It was covered by Evermore on the single Light Surrounding You. Andy Timmons\, Paul Gilbert and Steve Vai covered it for the 90th Anniversary Ibanez concert. the Zodiacs (1965) Trooper (1979) Praying Mantis (1981) Skew Siskin (1992) Quiet Riot covered the song on their album "Down to the Bone" (1995) Cactus Jack (2002) Status Quo (17 November 2003) Flunk (2 May 2005) WaveGroup Sound (2007) Metallica covered the song at the Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame Anniversary Show with Ray Davies on vocals. The Adolescents covered this song on their live album\, Return To The Black Hole. Jessica Harp covered this song on the motion picture soundtrack "Shanghai Knights" The Brilliant Green\, featured on their 2010 single "Blue Daisy" 2 Live Crew\, parodied the song in track "One And One" in 1987's Move Somethin' Zwan covered the song in one of their latest live concerts.  Use in pop culture  "All Day and All of the Night" was featured in television advertisements for Starburst candy in 1998 and 1999.  The Wavegroup Sound cover of "All Day and All of the Night" is featured in the video game Guitar Hero: Aerosmith.  "All Day and All of the Night" is played in the video game Battlefield Vietnam.  "All Day and All of the Night" is played during the opening and closing credits of The Boat That Rocked and is also used in a trailer for the film.

She quickly became a popular attraction. Hall left the Taft in 1940\, taking Dolly with him. In July of 1941 he grew weary of leading a band and turned over his orchestra to Dolly\, renaming it Dolly Dawn and her Dawn Patrol. Dolly was successful leading the group\, but the stress of the job soon got to her. Her singing career was doing quite well\, and she found it easier to book herself solo than with the band. In March of 1942 she gave up the orchestra. COL channel name VAL warholsoup100	0

You might want to check out this other jazz artist on harp: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QORJxhL27cc  ******************************************************************************************  About the Artists (info from Wikipedia):  William John Evans\, known as Bill Evans (August 16\, 1929 -- September 15\, 1980) was an American jazz pianist. His use of impressionist harmony\, inventive interpretation of traditional jazz repertoire\, and trademark rhythmically independent\, "singing" melodic lines influenced a generation of pianists including: Chick Corea\, Herbie Hancock\, John Taylor\, Steve Kuhn\, Don Friedman\, Denny Zeitlin\, Bobo Stenson\, Michel Petrucciani and Keith Jarrett\, as well as many other musicians world-wide. The music of Bill Evans continues to inspire younger pianists like Marcin Wasilewski\, Fred Hersch\, Bill Charlap\, Lyle Mays\, Eliane Elias[1] and arguably Brad Mehldau\, early in his career.  He is considered the most influential post World War II jazz pianist. Evans is an inductee of the Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame. *** Edgar "Eddie" Gómez (born October 4\, 1944) is a Puerto Rican jazz double bassist born in Santurce\, Puerto Rico\, perhaps most notable for his work done with the Bill Evans trio from 1966 to 1977.  Gómez emigrated with his family at a young age to the United States of America and grew up in New York.  He started on double bass in the New York City school system at the age of eleven and at age thirteen went to the New York City High School of Music and Art. He played in the Newport Festival Youth Band (led by Marshall Brown) from 1959 to 1961\, and graduated from Juilliard in 1963. His impressive résumé includes performances with jazz giants such as Miles Davis\, Dizzy Gillespie\, Gerry Mulligan\, Benny Goodman\, Buck Clayton\, Bill Bruford\, Marian McPartland\, Paul Bley\, Wayne Shorter\, Steps Ahead\, Steve Gadd\, Jeremy Steig\, Herbie Hancock\, Tony Williams\, Al Foster\, Chick Corea\, Eugenio Toussaint and Carli Muñoz. Time lauded: "Eddie Gómez has the world on his strings".  He would spend a total of eleven years with the Bill Evans Trio\, which included performances throughout the United States\, Europe\, and Asia\, as well as dozens of recordings.  Two of the Trio's recordings won Grammy awards. In addition\, he was a member of the Manhattan Jazz Quintet. His career mainly consists of working as an accompanist\, a position suited for his quick reflexes and flexibility.  In addition to working as a studio musician for many famous jazz musicians\, he has recorded as a leader for Columbia Records\, Projazz and Stretch.  Most of his recent recordings as a leader are co-led by jazz pianist Mark Kramer.  *** COL channel name VAL 65Seasons	0

COL title VAL I'm Comin' Virginia COL performer VAL Barbara Lea with The Johnny Windhurst Quintets	COL video title VAL My Melancholy Baby (1947) Les Paul Trio COL description VAL "Along with the 1944 JATP concert\, this bargain-priced collection of 21 MacGregor radio transcriptions from 1947 is the best example we have of Les Paul's abilities as a jazz guitarist. Though one can still hear the formative Django Reinhardt harmonic influence in the single-string runs\, Paul's showboating style is fully formed here\, marked by humor and mind-boggling speed\, but also by a lyrical gift in ballads like "Stardust." The songs\, mostly standards and uncredited public domain material\, are all rather brief\, but that imposes a welcome discipline on the solos\, although Paul did tend to repeat certain ideas from song to song at that time. The CD box fails to name the members of the trio\, but one can surmise from the year that Paul Smith is on piano\, Cal Gooden is on rhythm guitar\, and Bob Meyer is on bass; and they make a nifty\, tight-knit foursome."

COL title VAL Welcome to the Jungle COL performer VAL Iron Horse [1]	COL video title VAL Kris Kristofferson - For the good times (1970) COL description VAL Fair use - no copyright violation intended  "For the good times" from Kris' debut album "Kristofferson". It's so sad and beautiful at the same time...  Great lyrics as always\, and this beautiful tune ... I love it!  Of course this song was not written about Rita and him\, but things always happen twice in one's lifetime...  It was Kris'  first No 1 country hit as a writer in 1970 It was "Song of the Year" (and "Single Record of the Year") of the Academy of Country Music in 1970 - (That was the first time a writer had won "Song of the Year" awards from both the Country Music Association  - with "Sunday Mornin' comin' down"- AND the Academy of Country Music for different songs in the same year)  In 1971 Ray Price won a Grammy Award for "Best Male Country Vocal Performance" with it.  The scenes are from the movies "The last honor of Kathryn Beck"- aka "Act of Passion" (1984) and "Blood and Orchids" (TV\, 1986). Both movies are great to me and worth watching anyway\, but only available on VHS tapes. ... The latter one is available on DVD now http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0035QHNVU  Kris already began to write the song in 1968\, in his Opel\, on one of his endless rides from Nashville to the Gulf.   "I began a song about making love to a woman for the last time. After a while the melody really got to me. I couldn't wait to get to a guitar. I was riding along thinking about that part where it says\, 'Hear the whisper of the raindrops blowin' soft against the window\,' and I wondered if I could play it. I wrote only the first part of the lyrics then. A while went before I finished it\, I can't remember how long.... But I do remember who I wrote it about." Probably it was inspired by the dying days of his relationship to Fran...  Now it's hard to believe that for a time some radio stations wouldn't play the original recording by Bill Nash because of its "overtly sexual content"; indeed for a brief time\, Kris couldn't even find anyone who wanted to record the song... And then? A spokeman for Buckhorn Music\, which published the song shortly before Kris switched to Combine Music\, said later\, "It's recorded by pretty much everyone who comes into town to do an album\, Englebert Humperndinck\, Dean Martin\, Andy Williams\, Chet Atkins\, Loretta Lynn and many more."  For the good times  Don't look so sad\, I know it's over But life goes on and this old world will keep on turning Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together There's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning  Lay your head upon my pillow\, hold your warm and tender body close to mine Hear the whisper of the raindrops blowin' soft against the window And make believe you love me one more time For the good times   I'll get along\, you'll find another  And I'll be here if you should find  you ever need me Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever  There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me   Lay your head upon my pillow Hold your warm and tender body close to mine Hear the whisper of the raindrops Blowin' soft against my window Make believe you love me one more time For the good times   For the good times (1968)  Schau nicht so traurig\, ich weiß\, es ist vorbei. Aber das Leben geht weiter  und diese alte Welt wird sich weiterdrehen. Lass uns einfach froh sein\,  dass wir einige Zeit zusammen verbringen konnten Wir müssen uns nicht die Brücken anschauen\, die wir verbrennen.  Leg deinen Kopf auf mein Kissen\, halte deinen warmen und zärtlichen Körper  dicht an meinen Hör das Flüstern der Regentropfen  weich gegen das Fenster schlagen Und lass mich noch einmal glauben\, dass du mich liebst - wegen der guten Zeiten  Ich werd zurecht kommen\, du wirst einen anderen finden. Und ich werde hier sein falls du je entscheidest\, dass du mich brauchst. Sag kein Wort über das Morgen oder das Fürimmer. Es wird noch genug Zeit sein fürs Traurigsein wenn du mich verlässt...

COL title VAL The Battle of New Orleans COL performer VAL Johnny Cash	COL video title VAL Wilson Pickett - Hey Jude (w/ Duane Allman) COL description VAL Before there was The Allman Brothers Band\, Duane Allman was trying to attract any kind of attention and make a name for himself. The music business is hard you know. Though immortalized now as one of the greatest guitarist of all time\, it was Gregg who was more sought out in the record business in the early days. So Duane made ends meet by being a session guitarist in studios while he decided what his next move would be.  It was in November of 1968\, when Wilson Pickett - already a star - showed up at Rick Halls Fame Studio in Muscle Shoals\, AL wanting to record\, but with no material or ideas. Duane\, who was working for Rick but was not even the main\, lead session guitarist\, suggested that they cut "Hey Jude"\, which Rick thought was "the most preposterous thing" he had ever heard and Wilson agreed they would NOT do it. The Beatles had just recently released it and it was climbing the charts. But Duane somehow convinced them both it was a good idea because it "was" a Beatles song and it "would" be Number 1. And\, as you hear\, it was a GREAT idea. This song sparked the beginning of Duane's future nickname and the formation of ABB.  The story goes that Duane was already known as "Dog" because of his looks. As you might imagine\, the hippie look that Duane sported was few and far between in late 1960's Alabama. When Wilson heard the way Duane played he started calling him "Sky Man". Not just for his "out of this world" playing but also for his "out of this world" state of mind he liked being in (recreational activities for those who still don't get it). From there the name somewhere morphed into "Skydog". Rick Hall was also so amazed that he phoned Jerry Wexler and put the phone up to the speakers on the playback so he could hear the song. Needless to say\, he was also blown away by Duane's playing. And in Wilson's defense of this DA story\, his vocals in this song are what they are in all his songs -- AWESOME.  Jerry Wexler was Wilson's main producer for Atlantic who wasn't able to be there and gave the reins to Hall. Wexler\, along with Phil Walden\, later in '69\, started Capricorn Records in Macon\, GA and we all know that story. Also\, Phil Walden is also the man who introduced and brought in Jaimoe to play with Duane. They started jamming together before any of the other Brothers joined in.  Well anyway - this is for your listening pleasure and hope you enjoy it. If you want to know more of this story\, I highly recommend pp. 80-88 of "Skydog: The Duane Allman Story" by Randy Poe. It is where this info came from and it is the best book ever if you are a Duane and/or ABB fan. And the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section...thank you...you helped change the world and the music for the better. COL channel name VAL MrElDuderino85	0

At least the album cover didn't fall apart on this one like the other one\, but it had no labels  when I removed it from the album.  I found them in like new condition inside the album\, maybe they were so budgeted you had to affix your own labels\, which I'll do with some 3M adhesive.

Their marriage ended in 1957\, but his love for her never did. It was an unusually amicable ending caused by his drinking problem and the seperate success she began to have when she went into rock & roll as Jean Chapel. Sadly he was left in the wings.   He passed away on Jan.1\, 1970\, and she passed on Aug. 12\, 1995. Both had remarried\, but the bond had never been truly broken between them\, mainly because of their daughter Lana.  Lana and her Mom\, whom he always called Mattie\, drank a private toast together to him every New Year's Eve after his death. New Year's Eve was his favorite and most sentimental occassion...and strangely enough\, he lived through New Year's Eve of 1969 in the hospital to die in the early hours of New Year's Day\, 1970.  Both Salty and Matiie had the same birthday of Mar. 6th..though different years. They had a truly psychic connection.  Maybe they're jamming again on that big stage in the sky..... Lana would surely like to think so\, for she'd like to get back into the act again someday.... COL channel name VAL SALTYHOLMES	1

COL title VAL Down by the Riverside COL performer VAL Taj Mahal	COL video title VAL Kenny Drew - On Green Dolphin Street (1985). COL description VAL Drew was born in New York City in 1928 and received piano lessons from the age of five.He attended The High School of Music & Art in Manhattan. Drew's first recording\, in 1950\, was with Howard McGhee\, and over the next two years he worked in bands led by Buddy DeFranco\, Coleman Hawkins\, Lester Young\, and Charlie Parker\, among others.After a brief period with his own trio in California\, Drew returned to New York\, playing with Dinah Washington\, Johnny Griffin\, Buddy Rich\, and several others over the following few years.He led many recording sessions throughout the '50s\, and in 1957 appeared on John Coltrane's album Blue Train.  Drew was one of several American jazz musicians who settled in Europe around this period: he moved to Paris in 1961 and to Copenhagen three years later.While he sacrificed much of the interest of the American jazz audience\, he gained a wide following across Europe. Kenny Drew was a well-known figure on the Copenhagen jazz scene\, recording many sessions with the Danish bassist Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen. "Living in Copenhagen\, and travelling out from there\," Drew remarked\, "I have probably worked in more different contexts than if I had stayed in New York where I might have got musically locked in with a set-group of musicians. This way\, I have been able to keep my musical antennas in shape\, while at the same time I have had more time to study and also get deeper into my own endeavors."  Drew and Dexter Gordon appeared on screen in Ole Ege's theatrically released hardcore pornographic film Pornografi - en musical (1971)\, for which they composed and performed the score.  Drew died in 1993 and was interred in the Assistens Cemetery in Norrebro\, Copenhagen. He has a street named after him in southern Copenhagen\, "Kenny Drews Vej" (Eng.\, Kenny Drew Street).  His son\, Kenny Drew\, Jr.\, was also a jazz pianist. _______________________________________________________________________________________________ Tracklist: 1.On Green Dolphin Street (T.Washington/B.Kaper) _______________________________________________________________________________________________   Personnel: 1.Kenny Drew - piano  2.Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen - bass  3.Ed Thigpen - drums. _______________________________________________________________________________________________  Genre:Jazz/Hard Bop/Contemporary Jazz Recorded: at Easy Sound Studio\, Copenhagen;August 24-25\, 1985.

Available in physical form direct from website http://HistoryofRnB.net   Download from   Amazon http://www.amazon.co.uk/Those-Hoodlum-Friends-Coasters-Stereo/dp/B00BR0QU6A/ref=dm_cd_album_lnk  iTunes https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/those-hoodlum-friends-coasters/id609884465    Stream from Spotify http://open.spotify.com/album/6IDmQkLUjCQe6poBO4izrg   The Coasters had the benefit of recording in the best studios\, backed by the best musicians and produced by the top producers of their generation\, Leiber and Stoller. Naturally\, they were required to run through as many takes of each song as was necessary to satisfy the exacting demands of their mentors. Luckily for us\, many of these alternate takes have survived. Mono was the standard recording format until the late 1960s\, but many of the big selling artists also recorded alternate versions specifically for the stereo market\, which was targeted to the discerning adult listener.     Disc One features all the alternate stereo versions of Coasters songs that were issued at the time on album and subsequently on CD. Disc Two takes you deep into the heart of Coasters sessions with composite tracks which combine studio chatter together with the finest moments from various different takes. This disc contains several outtakes which have until now been unavailable anywhere and gives an invaluable insight into the genesis of many well-loved tracks and also into the character and working practice of the Coasters and of their producers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller.     The accompanying 24-page booklet includes many rare photos and an exhaustive session discography by Claus Röhnisch. A collection for Coasters and early rock 'n' roll aficionados!

Gloria\, du willst alles geben\, in dir brennt wie ein Feuer\, der wilde Hunger nach dem Leben\, unsichtbare Stimmen rufen laut: Du wirst frei sein. Rufen Gloria.  Gloria\, du denkst dir immer wieder Gloria\, jetzt werf ich alle Fesseln ab.  Gloria\, die Nacht ist voller Lieder Gloria\, doch wenn du da richtig hinhörst\, hörst du\, wie der Teufel lacht. durch die neonhelle Nacht ruft er Gloria.  Aha ha\, aha ha Gloria\, du glaubst noch an Wunder\, du musst lernen zu kämpfen\, denn wer schwach ist geht hier unter. Lass dir nicht die Zukunft stehlen\, lass dir nicht dein Lachen nehmen\, süsses Gift ist der Traum der dich lockt\, aber bitter sind die Tränen  wenn du nur richtig hinhörst hörst du\, wie der Teufel lacht. durch die neonhelle Nacht ruft er Gloria.  Gloria\, du willst alles geben\, in dir brennt nie ein Feuer\, der wilde Hunger nach dem Leben\, unsichtbare Stimmen rufen laut: Du wirst frei sein. oh ho rufen Gloria.

It was the lead single from their album Green River and was released in April 1969\, four months before the album. The song reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart for three weeks in September 1969. It was CCR's second gold single.  The song has been recorded by at least 20 different artists\, in styles ranging from folk to reggae to psychedelic rock.  In 2011\, Rolling Stone ranked it #364 on its "500 Greatest Songs of All Time" list.  Composition  Fogerty reportedly wrote "Bad Moon Rising" after watching The Devil and Daniel Webster. Inspired by a scene in the film involving a hurricane\, Fogerty claims the song is about "the apocalypse that was going to be visited upon us."  Mondegreen  The refrain in the chorus\, "there's a bad moon on the rise\," is commonly misheard as "there's a bathroom on the right". Fogerty has parodied the mishearing in live performances of the song.  Cover versions  Jerry Lee Lewis released a version of the song on his 1973 album\, The Session.  Fogerty and Lewis recorded a version together that was released on Lewis' 2010 album\, Mean Old Man.  Emmylou Harris released a version of the song on her 1981 album\, Evangeline.  A 1986 version by the Australian band the Reels reached number 11 on the Australian charts.  The Scottish traditional group Battlefield Band recorded a version for their 1987 album After Hours: Forward to Scotland's Past.  Soundtrack  The song has been used in a number of films\, including: An American Werewolf in London\, My Fellow Americans\, Twilight Zone: The Movie\, Blade\, Sweet Home Alabama\, My Girl\, Man of the House\, Mr. Woodcock and The Big Chill.  It has also appeared in many television programs\, including: Supernatural\, Cold Case\, Northern Exposure and Alvin and the Chipmunks\, in which it is performed by the titular characters.  A remixed version of the song can be heard in the video game Crackdown 2.  The song was available as a playable song for Guitar Hero 5 series of music rhythm video games as downloadable content.  Rock Band Music Gaming Platform  The song was made available to download on March 1\, 2011 for use in the Rock Band 3 music gaming platform in both Basic rhythm\, and PRO mode which takes advantage of the use of a real guitar / bass guitar\, along with standard MIDI-compatible electronic drum kits / keyboards in addition to three-part harmony vocals.

The first known published version of a "Frankie and Johnny" melody appeared in 1904 in the song "He Done Me Wrong (The Death Of Bill Bailey)"\, written by Hughie Cannon.  A variation on the melody\, with words and music by Frank and Bert Leighton\, appeared in 1908 under the title "Bill\, You Done Me Wrong". It was republished in 1912\, credited to the Leighton Brothers and Ren Shields\, as the more commonly recognizable "Frankie and Johnny".  The first known recording of Frankie and Johnny was in 1912\,  a vocal by Gene Greene accompanied by Charlie Straight on a very rare British Pathé 78 rpm disk.  The Leighton brothers recorded it for Victor in 1916 but it was never issued. Al Bernard made the first American recording for Brunswick in May of 1921\, followed a month later by this recording by Frank Crumit with the Biese Trio. In 1927\, Crumit recorded it again for Victor Records using different lyrics. COL channel name VAL bsgs98	0

Crazy some'd say Where is the life that I recognize?  But I won't cry for yesterday there's an ordinary world Somehow I have to find And as I try to make my way to the ordinary world I will learn to survive  Papers in the roadside tell of suffering and greed Here today\, forgot tomorrow Here besides the news of holy war and holy need Ours is just a little sorrowed talk What has happened to the world? Crazy some'd say Where is my friend when I need you most?  But I won't cry for yesterday there's an ordinary world Somehow I have to find And as I try to make my way to the ordinary world I will learn to survive  Any world is my world Any world is my world Any world is my world Every world is my world COL channel name VAL SaybiaFTW	0

A6 Chante A7 Rosbeef Attack B1 La Nuit Le Jour B2 Tout Est Fini B3 Tes Yeux B4 Tu Perds Ton Temps B5 Trop Sage B6 Debbie Merci B7 Froggies Strike Back!  ------------------------  "All Day and All of the Night" is a song by the British band The Kinks from 1964. It reached #2 on the UK Singles Chart and #7 on the United States Charts. Like their previous hit "You Really Got Me"\, the song relies on a simple sliding power chord riff\, although this song's riff is slightly more complicated\, incorporating a B Flat after the chords F and G. Otherwise\, the recordings are similar in beat and structure\, with similar background vocals\, progressions\, and guitar solos. In 2003 it appeared as #57 on Pure Pop's list of The 100 Best Singles of All. The guitar solo break by Dave Davies is truly inspired and difficult to copy\, and deemed to be so excellent that for many years it was claimed that Jimmy Page played the break - however\, it has been documented\, and confirmed by Ray Davies\, that Dave made up and played the solo himself\, accidentally augmenting the unique riff by playing it through an amp with a hole in it. Time.  Cover versions  The Stranglers made a cover in 1988\, reaching #7 in the UK singles charts. The Remains also did a cover of the song. It can be found on their album\, "A Session with The Remains". It was covered by Evermore on the single Light Surrounding You. Andy Timmons\, Paul Gilbert and Steve Vai covered it for the 90th Anniversary Ibanez concert. the Zodiacs (1965) Trooper (1979) Praying Mantis (1981) Skew Siskin (1992) Quiet Riot covered the song on their album "Down to the Bone" (1995) Cactus Jack (2002) Status Quo (17 November 2003) Flunk (2 May 2005) WaveGroup Sound (2007) Metallica covered the song at the Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame Anniversary Show with Ray Davies on vocals. The Adolescents covered this song on their live album\, Return To The Black Hole. Jessica Harp covered this song on the motion picture soundtrack "Shanghai Knights" The Brilliant Green\, featured on their 2010 single "Blue Daisy" 2 Live Crew\, parodied the song in track "One And One" in 1987's Move Somethin' Zwan covered the song in one of their latest live concerts.  Use in pop culture  "All Day and All of the Night" was featured in television advertisements for Starburst candy in 1998 and 1999.  The Wavegroup Sound cover of "All Day and All of the Night" is featured in the video game Guitar Hero: Aerosmith.  "All Day and All of the Night" is played in the video game Battlefield Vietnam.  "All Day and All of the Night" is played during the opening and closing credits of The Boat That Rocked and is also used in a trailer for the film.

Join our Youtube: https://goo.gl/8AOGaN Join our Facebook: http://goo.gl/5oL723 Charles Edward Anderson "Chuck" Berry (born October 18\, 1926) is an American guitarist\, singer and songwriter and is one of the pioneers of rock and roll music. With songs such as "Maybellene" (1955)\, "Roll Over Beethoven" (1956)\, "Rock and Roll Music" (1957) and "Johnny B. Goode" (1958)\, Berry refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive\, with lyrics focusing on teen life and consumerism and music featuring guitar solos and showmanship that were a major influence on subsequent rock music. Born into a middle-class African-American family in St. Louis\, Missouri\, Berry had an interest in music from an early age and gave his first public performance at Sumner High School. While still a high-school student he was convicted of armed robbery and was sent to a reformatory\, where he was held from 1944 to 1947. After his release\, Berry settled into married life and worked at an automobile assembly plant. By early 1953\, influenced by the guitar riffs and showmanship techniques of the blues musician T-Bone Walker\, Berry began performing with the Johnnie Johnson Trio. His break came when he traveled to Chicago in May 1955 and met Muddy Waters\, who suggested he contact Leonard Chess\, of Chess Records. With Chess he recorded "Maybellene"—Berry's adaptation of the country song "Ida Red"—which sold over a million copies\, reaching number one on Billboard magazine's rhythm and blues chart. By the end of the 1950s\, Berry was an established star with several hit records and film appearances and a lucrative touring career. He had also established his own St. Louis nightclub\, Berry's Club Bandstand. But in January 1962\, he was sentenced to three years in prison for offenses under the Mann Act—he had transported a 14-year-old girl across state lines.

Great times Great memories.Cheers Oz Guys I got this info from "Wikipedia" on 'Baby Please Don't Go'    In the 1960s\, "Baby\, Please Don't Go" became a popular rock song after the Northern Irish group Them recorded it in 1964. Several music writers have identified Jimmy Page\, a studio guitarist at the time\, as participating in the recording\, although his exact contributions are unclear. Subsequently\, Them's uptempo rock arrangement has become a rock standard. "Baby\, Please Don't Go" has been inducted into both the Blues and Rock and Roll Halls of Fame.

COL title VAL Stormy Monday COL performer VAL Lou Rawls	COL video title VAL Lorez Alexandria w/The Ramsey Lewis Trio -- Rocks In My Bed (Monophonic Version) [1960] COL description VAL Continuing with saga of America's most gifted\, and underrated jazz vocalists—this particular artist takes the cake—not meaning the particular term in a negative connotation\, but it's such a pity that a remarkable songstress—the incomparable\, Lorez Alexandria is not afforded the recognition that she so deserves. This is proven true\, given the fact that I recently discovered her albums—and I just haven't had my fill. I've searched and purchased everything I could find from such a gifted songstress. Lorez crafts each lyric with such grace and tonality that could easily match (if not surpass) the reigning jazz stylists of the bop/jazz/pop age. She gives each standard a new sense of evocative meaning as far as lyrics are concerned\, and reinvents the wheel each time she unleashes her enthralling voice. As she once said "A lyric is dead\, until you breathe life into it." This is exactly what she does. Enjoy and listen in HD\, to the lovely—Lorez Alexandria.

The 7 Natural Wonders of the World COL description VAL HAPPY FATHER'S DAY!  Note to all my AMP friends: this is a RE-UPLOAD. I first uploaded this song on 05/26/2010 for Father's Day ~WhiteLibraTexas~ --------------------------------------------------------------------  Many lists have been compiled for the Seven Natural Wonders of the World; however\, the list compiled by CNN is the most recognized. Although all of these seven natural wonders are still in existence today\, and are still being adored by many tourists across the globe\, the New7Wonders Foundation launched a campaign in 2007 to select a new list of natural wonders. The declaration of the New Seven Natural Wonders of the World will take place in 2011.  The Following is CNN list of seven breathtaking wonders of the world created by nature itself\, in random order:  1. Magical dancing lights\, performing through the night! -- AURORA BOREALIS (Alaska) 2. A thousand tiny islands in one mountain cupped bay\, no way! -- HARBOR OF RIO DE JANEIRO (Brazil) 3. A canyon so vast\, and carved out of the past! -- GRAND CANYON (USA) 4. A giant coral reef\, with fish beyond belief! -- GREAT BARRIER REEF (Australia) 5.  A mountain so high it almost reaches the sky! -- MOUNT EVEREST (Himalayas) 6.  A volcano that grew\, nearly right in front of you! -- PARICUTIN VOLCANO (Mexico) 7.  Falls so tall\, a dinosaur would feel small! - VICTORIA FALLS (South Africa)       ~Planetpals~ ---------------------------------------------------- DADDY'S LOVE (an acrostic poem)  Daddy's love\, so beautiful Aurora\, you're colorful\, but not as wonderful Daddy's love\, can never be detached Deep Grand Canyon\, you're so vast\, but not a match  Yesterdays\, today and into tomorrows Surpassing all sorrow 'though times are borrowed Love of Daddy\, so solid\, like Mount Kilimanjaro Only his love is indestructible and so magical Victoria Falls\, you're fantastic\, but you don't have his magic  Endless love and wind beneath my wings\, that's my Daddy!  ~I love you\, Daddy! Happy Father's Day - From WhiteLibraTexas~ ----------------------------------------------------------  I picked the featured song\, "Wind Beneath My Wings\," to dedicate to the coolest father on earth\, my Daddy\, and to all the wonderful fathers across the globe\, too. This song describes my feelings for my Daddy\, very perfectly.    This beautiful song has been recorded by many popular artists\, to include Roger Whittaker\, Gladys Knight\, Lou Rawls\, B.J. Thomas\, Sheena Easton\, and Bette Middler\, to name just a few. For this clip\, I am featuring a new version by the Canadian identical twin vocalists\, Ryan and Dan Kowarsky. The twins are now based in London\, England.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I've also uploaded three other Father's Day clips\, featuring the 7 Ancient Wonders of the World\, the New 7 Wonders of the World\, and the 7 Underwater Wonders of the World.

COL title VAL Love is Blue COL performer VAL Johnny Johnson and The Bandwagon	COL video title VAL Paul Mauriat: ♫ L'Amour est bleu (Love is Blue) ♫ COL description VAL Sucesso de Paul Mauriat e sua orquestra em 1968\, "L'Amour est bleu" ("Love is Blue")  é uma composição de Pierre Cour e André Popp\, que a gravou originalmente em 1967. A canção foi enorme sucesso não só na França\, mas também em vários países do mundo\, e recebeu inúmeras gravações\, como as de Caravelli\, Claudine Longet\, Clementine\, Gabor Szabo\, Jeff Beck\, Los Indios Trabajaras\, Michel Fugain\, Michele Torr\, Ray Conniff\, Richard Clayderman\, Sandpipers\, Santo and Johnny\, The Dells\, Vicky Leandros e outros. No Brasil foram registrações versões\, intituladas "O amor é azul"\,  de Clara Nunes\, Celly Campello\, Luiz Loy e seu Conjunto e The Jordans. A gravação de Paul Mauriat é o principal hit da carreira deste orquestrador francês nascido em 4 de março de 1925 em Marselha.  O talento de Paul Mauriat é hereditário. Era filho de uma família de músicos\, tendo seu pai como primeiro mestre. Aos quatro anos\, iniciou seus estudos de piano. Aos dez\, entra para o Conservatório de Paris\, saindo quatro anos mais tarde decidido a seguir a carreira de concertista. O encontro com o jazz\, entretanto\, muda os planos iniciais do artista. O novo ritmo decididamente influencia o estilo que o tornaria famoso em todo o mundo.  Mauriat cresceu em Paris e aos dezessete anos\, organiza sua própria orquestra\, apresentando-se em cabarés e teatros na França e em outros países da Europa. Na década de 50\, tornou-se o arranjador preferido de vários cantores franceses\, entre os quais se destaca a figura de Charles Aznavour. Fã da Música Popular Brasileira\, Mauriat gravou clássicos como Casa no campo (Zé Rodrix - Tavito)\, Amada amante (Roberto Carlos - Erasmo Carlos)\, Presepada (Antonio Carlos - Jocafi)\, Naquela mesa (Sergio Bittencourt)\, Viagem (J.de Aquino - Paulo César Pinheiro) e outros.  Ele se retirou da profissão em 1998\, num último show em Osaka\, Japão. Mas a orquestra ainda faz shows pelo mundo\, e inclusive fez duas viagens para a China. Em 2002 o escritor e perito na vida do maestro\, Serge Elhaik lançou uma biografia autorizada escrita em francês\, que se chama "Une vie en Bleu". Esta biografia contém valiosas informações sobre a discografia de Mauriat e muitas fotos dele e de sua orquestra. Nos últimos meses de vida\, o maestro ficou residindo em sua casa de verão na cidade de Perpignan. Foi internado no hospital da cidade\, muito fraco e\, após 2 dias internado\, a 1 da manhã do dia 3 de Novembro (horário local) de 2006\, Paul Mauriat faleceu aos 81 anos.

Via della povertà    (versione LIVE eseguita a Viareggio nei primi anni "80)   Il Salone di bellezza in fondo al vicolo  è affollatissimo di marinai  prova a chiedere a uno che ore sono  e ti risponderà "non l'ho saputo mai".  Le cartoline dell'impiccagione  sono in vendita a cento lire l'una  il commissario cieco dietro la stazione  per un indizio ti legge la sfortuna  e le forze dell'ordine irrequiete  cercano qualcosa che non va  mentre io e la mia signora ci affacciamo stasera su via della Povertà. Signorile sembra così facile  ogni volta che sorride ti cattura  ricorda proprio Bette Davis  con le mani appoggiate alla cintura.  Arriva Lombardi trafelato  e le grida "la sinistra sei tu!"  ma qualcuno gli dice di andar via  perché ormai non esiste piu' e l'unico suono che rimane  quando l'ambulanza se ne va  è Signorile che spazza la strada  in via della Povertà. Mentre l'alba sta uccidendo la luna  e le stelle si son quasi nascoste  la signora che legge la fortuna  se n'è andata in compagnia dell'oste.  Ad eccezione di Abele e di Caino  tutti quanti sono andati a far l'amore  aspettando che venga la pioggia  ad annacquare la gioia ed il dolore  e il Cardinal Marcinkus sta affilando la sua pietà  se ne andrà a far la questua stasera  in via della Povertà. Al Quirinale sono disperati  Sandro Pertini è diventato vecchio  e Andreatta piange sconcertato  vedendo Craxi che ride nello specchio.  Sofia è dietro la finestra  tutti quanti le hanno detto che è bella  non ha ancora 53 anni  e mai nessuno l'ha chiamata zitella  la sua fuga sarà molto romantica  trasformandosi in oro se ne andrà  si è stufata di andare avanti e indietro in via della Povertà. Mongolfini travestito da pallone  ha nascosto i suoi appunti in un baule  è passato di qui un'ora fa  diretto verso l'ultima Thule\,  sembrava così timido e impaurito  quando ha chiesto di fermarsi un po' qui  ma poi ha cominciato a fumare  e a recitare l'A B C  ed a vederlo tu non lo diresti mai  ma era famoso qualche tempo fa  per suonare il violino elettrico  in via della Povertà. Ci si prepara per la grande festa  c'è qualcuno che comincia ad aver sete  Woityla ha gettato la ghiara si è travestito in abiti da prete  sta ingozzando a viva forza Berlinguer per punirlo della sua frugalità lo ucciderà parlandogli d'amore  dopo averlo avvelenato di pietà  e mentre Woityla grida  4 suore si son spogliate già  Berlinguer sta per essere violentato  in via della Povertà. E bravo Carboni mattacchione  il paese sta affondando nella merda e gli Anarchici tutti annegati e il capitano grida "ce ne stanno ancora"\,  e Agnelli e Indro Montanelli  fanno a pugni nella torre di comando  i suonatori di calipso ridono di loro  mentre il cielo si sta allontanando  e affacciati alle loro finestre nel mare  tutti pescano garofani e lillà  e nessuno deve più preoccuparsi  di via della Povertà. Il tuo articolo l'ho letto proprio ieri  ci hai messo dentro tutto quel che sai ma non essere ridicolo  non chiedermi "come stai"\,  questa gente di cui mi vai parlando  è quasi gente come tutti noi  non mi sembra che siano mostri  e né tanto meno eroi  e non mandarmi altre bozze da correggere nessuno ti risponderà  se non provi a spedirmi i tuoi articoli da via della Povertà.  Attraverso il gioco del rovescio della canzone di De André ha luogo la demitizzazione e la demistificazione. Via della Povertà ne offre un illuminato esempio. Marinai che affollano un salone di bellezza\, un commissario cieco che predice la sfortuna\, una Cenerentola non più ritrosa e fuggitiva ma spavalda ed energica come Bette Davis\, un Romeo che viene scacciato mentre fa la sua dichiarazione d'amore\, il Buon Samaritano che affila la pietà come se fosse un'arma e la indossa come una maschera di carnevale\, Mister Hyde in lacrime vedendo la sua parte cosiddetta sana "che ride nello specchio"\, un'Ofelia che si scopre zitella\, un Albert Einstein "travestito da ubriacone"\, il fantasma dell'opera "vestito in abiti da prete"\, un Casanova che "sta per essere violentato"\, il dio del mare che si diverte a far scendere negli abissi il Titanic mentre il sole si sta alzando: sono alcuni dei personaggi di un mondo carnevalizzato\, maschere di un teatrino dell'assurdo forse\, ma rivelatori di un modo d'essere degli uomini: "è gente come tutti noi / non mi sembra che siano mostri / non mi sembra che siano eroi".

COL title VAL The Way We Were COL performer VAL Vicky Leandros	COL video title VAL Bobby Scott  "Nature Boy"      (1990) COL description VAL In 1941\, a 33 year old George McGrew arrived in Los Angeles and began playing piano in the Eutropheon\, a small health food store and raw food restaurant on Laurel Canyon Boulevard. The cafe was owned by John and Vera Richter\, German immigrants who followed a Naturmensch and Lebensreform philosophy influenced by the Wandervogel movement in Germany.Their followers\, known as "Nature Boys"\, wore long hair and beards and ate only raw fruits and vegetables. McGrew adopted the philosophy and chose the name "eden ahbez"\, writing and spelling his name with lower-case letters. It was there while living in a cave near Palm Springs\, ahbez wrote "Nature Boy". Partly autobiographical\, the song was a tribute to his mentor Bill Pester\, who had originally introduced him to Naturmensch and Lebensreform.  In 1947\, at the prompting of Cowboy Jack Patton and Johnny Mercer\, ahbez approached Nat King Cole's manager backstage at the Lincoln Theater in Los Angeles\, handed him a tattered copy of "Nature Boy"\, and asked him to show it to Cole. However his pleas were ignored and a disappointed ahbez left the sheet music of "Nature Boy" with Cole's valet\, Otis Pollard. From him Cole came to know of the song and after reading it\, the singer loved it and began playing "Nature Boy" for live audiences to much acclaim. Irving Berlin\, who was present in the crowd\, had initially offered to buy the track from Cole. But he decided to record the track for himself and needed to get permission from ahbez before releasing it as a single. After ahbez was discovered living under the Hollywood Sign\, Cole got his permission and recorded the song COL channel name VAL nyronut	0

Via della povertà    (versione LIVE eseguita a Viareggio nei primi anni "80)   Il Salone di bellezza in fondo al vicolo  è affollatissimo di marinai  prova a chiedere a uno che ore sono  e ti risponderà "non l'ho saputo mai".  Le cartoline dell'impiccagione  sono in vendita a cento lire l'una  il commissario cieco dietro la stazione  per un indizio ti legge la sfortuna  e le forze dell'ordine irrequiete  cercano qualcosa che non va  mentre io e la mia signora ci affacciamo stasera su via della Povertà. Signorile sembra così facile  ogni volta che sorride ti cattura  ricorda proprio Bette Davis  con le mani appoggiate alla cintura.  Arriva Lombardi trafelato  e le grida "la sinistra sei tu!"  ma qualcuno gli dice di andar via  perché ormai non esiste piu' e l'unico suono che rimane  quando l'ambulanza se ne va  è Signorile che spazza la strada  in via della Povertà. Mentre l'alba sta uccidendo la luna  e le stelle si son quasi nascoste  la signora che legge la fortuna  se n'è andata in compagnia dell'oste.  Ad eccezione di Abele e di Caino  tutti quanti sono andati a far l'amore  aspettando che venga la pioggia  ad annacquare la gioia ed il dolore  e il Cardinal Marcinkus sta affilando la sua pietà  se ne andrà a far la questua stasera  in via della Povertà. Al Quirinale sono disperati  Sandro Pertini è diventato vecchio  e Andreatta piange sconcertato  vedendo Craxi che ride nello specchio.  Sofia è dietro la finestra  tutti quanti le hanno detto che è bella  non ha ancora 53 anni  e mai nessuno l'ha chiamata zitella  la sua fuga sarà molto romantica  trasformandosi in oro se ne andrà  si è stufata di andare avanti e indietro in via della Povertà. Mongolfini travestito da pallone  ha nascosto i suoi appunti in un baule  è passato di qui un'ora fa  diretto verso l'ultima Thule\,  sembrava così timido e impaurito  quando ha chiesto di fermarsi un po' qui  ma poi ha cominciato a fumare  e a recitare l'A B C  ed a vederlo tu non lo diresti mai  ma era famoso qualche tempo fa  per suonare il violino elettrico  in via della Povertà. Ci si prepara per la grande festa  c'è qualcuno che comincia ad aver sete  Woityla ha gettato la ghiara si è travestito in abiti da prete  sta ingozzando a viva forza Berlinguer per punirlo della sua frugalità lo ucciderà parlandogli d'amore  dopo averlo avvelenato di pietà  e mentre Woityla grida  4 suore si son spogliate già  Berlinguer sta per essere violentato  in via della Povertà. E bravo Carboni mattacchione  il paese sta affondando nella merda e gli Anarchici tutti annegati e il capitano grida "ce ne stanno ancora"\,  e Agnelli e Indro Montanelli  fanno a pugni nella torre di comando  i suonatori di calipso ridono di loro  mentre il cielo si sta allontanando  e affacciati alle loro finestre nel mare  tutti pescano garofani e lillà  e nessuno deve più preoccuparsi  di via della Povertà. Il tuo articolo l'ho letto proprio ieri  ci hai messo dentro tutto quel che sai ma non essere ridicolo  non chiedermi "come stai"\,  questa gente di cui mi vai parlando  è quasi gente come tutti noi  non mi sembra che siano mostri  e né tanto meno eroi  e non mandarmi altre bozze da correggere nessuno ti risponderà  se non provi a spedirmi i tuoi articoli da via della Povertà.  Attraverso il gioco del rovescio della canzone di De André ha luogo la demitizzazione e la demistificazione. Via della Povertà ne offre un illuminato esempio. Marinai che affollano un salone di bellezza\, un commissario cieco che predice la sfortuna\, una Cenerentola non più ritrosa e fuggitiva ma spavalda ed energica come Bette Davis\, un Romeo che viene scacciato mentre fa la sua dichiarazione d'amore\, il Buon Samaritano che affila la pietà come se fosse un'arma e la indossa come una maschera di carnevale\, Mister Hyde in lacrime vedendo la sua parte cosiddetta sana "che ride nello specchio"\, un'Ofelia che si scopre zitella\, un Albert Einstein "travestito da ubriacone"\, il fantasma dell'opera "vestito in abiti da prete"\, un Casanova che "sta per essere violentato"\, il dio del mare che si diverte a far scendere negli abissi il Titanic mentre il sole si sta alzando: sono alcuni dei personaggi di un mondo carnevalizzato\, maschere di un teatrino dell'assurdo forse\, ma rivelatori di un modo d'essere degli uomini: "è gente come tutti noi / non mi sembra che siano mostri / non mi sembra che siano eroi".

COL title VAL A Whole New World COL performer VAL Dave & Domino	COL video title VAL My Melancholy Baby (1947) Les Paul Trio COL description VAL "Along with the 1944 JATP concert\, this bargain-priced collection of 21 MacGregor radio transcriptions from 1947 is the best example we have of Les Paul's abilities as a jazz guitarist. Though one can still hear the formative Django Reinhardt harmonic influence in the single-string runs\, Paul's showboating style is fully formed here\, marked by humor and mind-boggling speed\, but also by a lyrical gift in ballads like "Stardust." The songs\, mostly standards and uncredited public domain material\, are all rather brief\, but that imposes a welcome discipline on the solos\, although Paul did tend to repeat certain ideas from song to song at that time. The CD box fails to name the members of the trio\, but one can surmise from the year that Paul Smith is on piano\, Cal Gooden is on rhythm guitar\, and Bob Meyer is on bass; and they make a nifty\, tight-knit foursome."

COL title VAL Puff (The Magic Dragon) COL performer VAL The Andrews Sisters	COL video title VAL Kris Kristofferson - For the good times (1970) COL description VAL Fair use - no copyright violation intended  "For the good times" from Kris' debut album "Kristofferson". It's so sad and beautiful at the same time...  Great lyrics as always\, and this beautiful tune ... I love it!  Of course this song was not written about Rita and him\, but things always happen twice in one's lifetime...  It was Kris'  first No 1 country hit as a writer in 1970 It was "Song of the Year" (and "Single Record of the Year") of the Academy of Country Music in 1970 - (That was the first time a writer had won "Song of the Year" awards from both the Country Music Association  - with "Sunday Mornin' comin' down"- AND the Academy of Country Music for different songs in the same year)  In 1971 Ray Price won a Grammy Award for "Best Male Country Vocal Performance" with it.  The scenes are from the movies "The last honor of Kathryn Beck"- aka "Act of Passion" (1984) and "Blood and Orchids" (TV\, 1986). Both movies are great to me and worth watching anyway\, but only available on VHS tapes. ... The latter one is available on DVD now http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0035QHNVU  Kris already began to write the song in 1968\, in his Opel\, on one of his endless rides from Nashville to the Gulf.   "I began a song about making love to a woman for the last time. After a while the melody really got to me. I couldn't wait to get to a guitar. I was riding along thinking about that part where it says\, 'Hear the whisper of the raindrops blowin' soft against the window\,' and I wondered if I could play it. I wrote only the first part of the lyrics then. A while went before I finished it\, I can't remember how long.... But I do remember who I wrote it about." Probably it was inspired by the dying days of his relationship to Fran...  Now it's hard to believe that for a time some radio stations wouldn't play the original recording by Bill Nash because of its "overtly sexual content"; indeed for a brief time\, Kris couldn't even find anyone who wanted to record the song... And then? A spokeman for Buckhorn Music\, which published the song shortly before Kris switched to Combine Music\, said later\, "It's recorded by pretty much everyone who comes into town to do an album\, Englebert Humperndinck\, Dean Martin\, Andy Williams\, Chet Atkins\, Loretta Lynn and many more."  For the good times  Don't look so sad\, I know it's over But life goes on and this old world will keep on turning Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together There's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning  Lay your head upon my pillow\, hold your warm and tender body close to mine Hear the whisper of the raindrops blowin' soft against the window And make believe you love me one more time For the good times   I'll get along\, you'll find another  And I'll be here if you should find  you ever need me Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever  There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me   Lay your head upon my pillow Hold your warm and tender body close to mine Hear the whisper of the raindrops Blowin' soft against my window Make believe you love me one more time For the good times   For the good times (1968)  Schau nicht so traurig\, ich weiß\, es ist vorbei. Aber das Leben geht weiter  und diese alte Welt wird sich weiterdrehen. Lass uns einfach froh sein\,  dass wir einige Zeit zusammen verbringen konnten Wir müssen uns nicht die Brücken anschauen\, die wir verbrennen.  Leg deinen Kopf auf mein Kissen\, halte deinen warmen und zärtlichen Körper  dicht an meinen Hör das Flüstern der Regentropfen  weich gegen das Fenster schlagen Und lass mich noch einmal glauben\, dass du mich liebst - wegen der guten Zeiten  Ich werd zurecht kommen\, du wirst einen anderen finden. Und ich werde hier sein falls du je entscheidest\, dass du mich brauchst. Sag kein Wort über das Morgen oder das Fürimmer. Es wird noch genug Zeit sein fürs Traurigsein wenn du mich verlässt...

COL title VAL Fools Rush In COL performer VAL The Morning Benders	COL video title VAL Tommy Dorsey -  "Oh Look At Me Now"  -  vocals - Frank Sinatra\,Connie Haines\, & The Pied Pipers COL description VAL "Oh! Look at Me Now" is a 1941 song composed by Joe Bushkin\, with lyrics by John DeVries. It is strongly associated with Frank Sinatra\, who first recorded it with Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra\, in an arrangement by Sy Oliver. Sinatra re-recorded the song in 1957 for the album A Swingin' Affair\, this time conducted by Nelson Riddle.  Frank Sinatra - with Tommy Dorsey\, Connie Haines and The Pied Pipers\, January 6\, 1941\, A Swingin' Affair! (1957)\, Sinatra 57 in Concert (1999)  Connie Haines died in September 2008 Obit... September 26\, 2008  Connie Haines\, a petite and dynamic big band singer who performed alongside Frank Sinatra in the Harry James and Tommy Dorsey orchestras\, died Monday in Clearwater\, Fla. The cause of death was myasthenia gravis\, an autoimmune neuromuscular disease. She was 87.  Haines was best known as a singer with a knack for rhythm\, and many of her most successful recordings -- 25 of which each sold more than 50\,000 copies -- featured her crisp\, swinging vocal style.   When Dorsey first heard her in action with James at Frank Dailey's Meadowbrook\, New Jersey's temple of big band music\, he reportedly asked\, "Hey\, little girl\, where'd you learn to swing like that? And when can you join my band?"  It didn't take long. Haines recorded "Comes Love" and "I Can't Afford to Dream" with James\, revealing a capacity to handle lyrical ballads as well as jitterbug specials\, before moving to the Dorsey organization with Sinatra.  James\, however\, was not fond of Haines' birth name -- Yvonne Marie Antoinette JaMais -- suggesting that it would take up too much space on a theater marquee. "You don't look like an Yvonne\," he said\, "you look like a Connie." And "Haines" was chosen\, apparently because it was a close rhyme to "James."  Haines quickly made the name her own\, however\, establishing herself as one of the prime female singers of the big band era. Many of her hit songs were the product of a warm musical partnership with Sinatra via tunes such as "Oh\, Look At Me Now\," "Let's Get Away From It All\," "Friendship\," "I'll Never Smile Again" and the jaunty rhythm tune "Snooty Little Cutie."  Like many big band vocalists of the '40s\, Haines moved on to a solo career as the public's preferences turned away from large ensemble swing to singers. Over the course of the next few decades\, she released more than 200 recordings\, ranging from her big band stylings to more contemporary rhythms.  The first white singer to record for Motown Records\, she released 14 songs written by Smokey Robinson\, including "What's Easy For Two Is Hard For One."  Haines also was drawn to gospel music as a reflection of her Christian beliefs\, recording and touring in an ensemble that included close friends Beryl Davis\, Rhonda Fleming and Jane Russell.  Although her career as an actress tended to be framed in films that allowed her to perform as a singer\, Haines' appearances in motion pictures such as "The Duchess of Idaho" suggested a talent that never had the opportunity to fully blossom within her lifelong dedication to music.  She was a regular on the Abbott & Costello Radio Show and a frequent guest artist during the golden years of television variety shows\, appearing with Milton Berle\, Eddie Cantor\, Perry Como\, Frankie Laine and Ed Sullivan\, among others.  Haines' marriage to Robert DeHaven\, an ace pilot during World War II\, ended in divorce.  She is survived by her mother\, Mildred JaMais\, who is 109; a son\, Robert DeHaven Jr. of San Francisco; a daughter\, Kimberly Harlan of Prineville\, Ore.; and three grandchildren."

This is very likely the most obscure charting version of this song. Don\, Dick and Jimmy had one other entry on the Hot 100; "That's What I Like" at #14 in October 1954.

It was covered by The Flying Lizards on their 1981 Fourth Wall LP. It was also covered by The Jam on the 1982 "Beat Surrender" EP.

In July of 1941 he grew weary of leading a band and turned over his orchestra to Dolly\, renaming it Dolly Dawn and her Dawn Patrol. Dolly was successful leading the group\, but the stress of the job soon got to her. Her singing career was doing quite well\, and she found it easier to book herself solo than with the band.

COL title VAL Honky Tonk Women COL performer VAL Billy Joel	COL video title VAL ♥ "Red Roses for a Blue Lady" - The Lettermen COL description VAL Song: Red Roses for a Blue Lady Singers: The Lettermen  The making of this video: This music video is a compilation of photos that I have previously taken (except the wedding gown photo).  The lovely lady wearing very deep dark blue dress who became the "circumstantial" or "incidental" subject of this video just happened to be walking towards my direction when I was trying to take the photo of the Shibuya Station (渋谷駅) Exit towards the famous Shibuya Hachiko (忠犬 ハチ公).  (See Wikipedia and type in "Hachiko" for this story.)  The HMV Music Store is a "shop till you drop" music store near Shibuya JR train & the Metro subway station in Tokyo.  It was my YT friend (60otaku3) who gave me the info where to find it in the Tokyo maze.   The floribunda red roses were from my garden.  The San-ai flower shop is in the prime corner spot of Ginza\, a very high class shopping district of downtown Tokyo. It was the blue roses of this flower shop that gave me the idea to make this video of this Lettermen song. Luckily this flower shop also had the white orchids on display.  Except for the beat and transitions\, my videos usually have no direct relation to the lyrics of the song.  This music video however has become a true composition and I like the outcome.  ***************************************  And to the beautiful Lady at Shibuya Station (渋谷駅): Thank you for wearing the right color and being at the right spot at the perfect time when I clicked the camera shutter.  That photo was taken at 1:34 p.m. on July 3\, 2008.  - COL channel name VAL 65Seasons	0

Available in physical form direct from website http://HistoryofRnB.net   Download from   Amazon http://www.amazon.co.uk/Those-Hoodlum-Friends-Coasters-Stereo/dp/B00BR0QU6A/ref=dm_cd_album_lnk  iTunes https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/those-hoodlum-friends-coasters/id609884465    Stream from Spotify http://open.spotify.com/album/6IDmQkLUjCQe6poBO4izrg   The Coasters had the benefit of recording in the best studios\, backed by the best musicians and produced by the top producers of their generation\, Leiber and Stoller. Naturally\, they were required to run through as many takes of each song as was necessary to satisfy the exacting demands of their mentors. Luckily for us\, many of these alternate takes have survived. Mono was the standard recording format until the late 1960s\, but many of the big selling artists also recorded alternate versions specifically for the stereo market\, which was targeted to the discerning adult listener.     Disc One features all the alternate stereo versions of Coasters songs that were issued at the time on album and subsequently on CD. Disc Two takes you deep into the heart of Coasters sessions with composite tracks which combine studio chatter together with the finest moments from various different takes. This disc contains several outtakes which have until now been unavailable anywhere and gives an invaluable insight into the genesis of many well-loved tracks and also into the character and working practice of the Coasters and of their producers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller.     The accompanying 24-page booklet includes many rare photos and an exhaustive session discography by Claus Röhnisch. A collection for Coasters and early rock 'n' roll aficionados!

COL title VAL Gloria COL performer VAL Lena Valaitis	COL video title VAL Ferrante and Teicher -   Tie A Yellow Ribbon COL description VAL "Endeavour to play easy pieces well and with elegance; that is better than to play difficult pieces badly." ― Robert Schumann ▼▼▼  FERRANTE AND TEICHER Ferrante & Teicher were a duo of American piano players\, known for their light arrangements of familiar classical pieces\, movie soundtracks\, show tunes and popsongs. Arthur Ferrante and Louis Teicher met while studying at the Juilliard School of Music in New York.  Musical prodigies\, they began performing as a piano duo while still in school. After graduating\, they both joined the Juilliard faculty. In 1947\, they launched a full-time concert career\, at first playing nightclubs\, then quickly moving up to playing classical music with orchestral backing.  Between 1950 and 1980\, they were a major American easy listening act\, and scored four big U.S. hits: "Theme From The Apartment" \, "Theme From Exodus" \, "Tonight" \, and "Midnight Cowboy" . They performed and recorded regularly with pops orchestras popular standards by George Gershwin\, Jerome Kern\, Cole Porter\, Richard Rodgers and others. In 1973\, they did the Hollywood Radio Theater theme for the Rod Serling radio drama series\, The Zero Hour. Both men were initiated as honorary members of Tau Kappa Epsilon at Central State University (now University of Central Oklahoma) while on tour. Ferrante and Teicher ceased performing in 1989 and retired to Longboat Key and Siesta Key\, respectively\, both close to each other on the west coast of Florida. They continued to play together occasionally at a local piano store. CDs of their music\, some of it not previously released\, have continued to appear.  TIE A YELLOW RIBBON "Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree"  was written by Irwin Levine and L. Russell Brown and was a worldwide hit for the group "Dawn" (featuring Tony Orlando)  in 1973.   The origin of the idea of a yellow ribbon as remembrance may have been the 19th century practice that some women allegedly had of wearing a yellow ribbon in their hair to signify their devotion to a husband or sweetheart serving in the U.S. Cavalry. The song "'Round Her Neck She Wears a Yeller Ribbon"\, which later inspired the John Wayne movie "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"\, is a reference to this. The symbol of a yellow ribbon became widely known in civilian life in the 1970s as a reminder that an absent loved one\, either in the military or in jail\, would be welcomed home on their return.  MHO A beautiful "full body" arrangement of this famous seventies pop theme with the piano's of Ferrante and Teicher backed up by a large orchestra.  Some really enjoyable and unexpected counterpart melodies with both the brass and the strings coming out equally surprising.   The "knacky" rhythm that can be heard in the background adds to the listening pleasure.   Have fun and enjoy ! COL channel name VAL Socratess2007	0

While there are hints of the original Julie London version\, Ms. Basinet's rendition is particularly bluesy\, while being a bit more sensual. Accompanied by a sensitive rhythm section\, the singer displays her beautiful voice on a version full of desire\, regret\, and quiet satisfaction at how the broken love affair turned out. The results are haunting and memorable." ~Scott Yanow\, author of ten jazz books including The Jazz Singers\, Jazz On Film and Jazz On Record 1917-76  Written by Arthur Hamilton Vocals - Cynthia Basinet Piano - Lee Musiker Acoustic Rhythm Guitar- Gerry Beaudoin Acoustic Bass- Jesse Williams Piano and Voice Recorded Nola Studios NYC NY Engineered and Mixed : Tim Kelher Post recording and Post Production : Produced by J.

(1939) COL description VAL Please activate the HD function(720p) before watching the video or watch it with a larger type player in 480p!  This in order to avoid serious sound distortion (as YT continues to reduce sound quality and does not activate HD or HQ playback automatically).  "Avant de mourir" (lit. Before I die) was composed by famed Romanian violinist\, composer and conductor Georges Boulanger (1893-1958). It is a beautiful haunting sad melody which became a enormous hit for Boulanger. In 1939 English lyrics were added to the music and "Avant de mourir" became "My prayer" -recorded by the orchestra of Glenn Miller and other bands...  In France "Avant de mourir" was featured in the Casino de Paris spectacle "Amours de Paris" starring Maurice Chevalier.  The title was changed to "Tout nous parle d'amour" (lit. Everything speaks to us of love) although another set of lyrics with the title "Ma prière" was written as well.... In 1958 the song was revived by The Platters and spent 21 weeks at number 1 in the US charts.  The version presented in this video was recorded by the orchestra of AJ Pesenti - a popular tango orchestra from the late 1930s...  The video features images of Paris from the 1930s....  About the record :  Pathé PA. 1673/ mx. CPT 4528 Paris\, 1939  Record in quite good condition.

COL title VAL Softly and Tenderly COL performer VAL Roy & Dale	COL video title VAL George Barnes -- Adios COL description VAL George Barnes era uno de los guitarristas más prolíficos y versátiles de los años cincuenta y sesenta. Aunque\, básicamente era un hombre de jazz\, era un maestro de todos los estilos: blues\, country\, folk\, pop\, R & R\, R & B. Fue uno de los primeros en grabar con la guitarra eléctrica y Chet Atkins\, Les Paul y Charlie Christian le han citado como una fuente de inspiración principal.  A la edad de 14 años\, Barnes ya era un músico profesional y  había formado su propio cuarteto George Barnes. Dos años más tarde grabó sus primeros discos consu propio nombre: "I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles" and "I Can't Believe That You're In Love With Me" para el sello Okeh. En 1938 estaba trabajando para la NBC\, como director de orquesta\, guitarrista y arreglista. Tras su paso por el ejército durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial\, Barnes volvió a su trabajo de estudio y grabó transcripciones de radio con su octeto inusual.  En 1951 se trasladó de Chicago a Nueva York\, donde de inmediato consiguió un contrato con Decca para grabar sus propios álbumes. George también se reunió con Carl Kress en 1951\, el comienzo de una amistad que iba a dar lugar a una  formación aclamada por la crítica.

Born Anita Belle Colton\, O'Day was admired for her sense of rhythm and dynamics\, and her early big band appearances shattered the traditional image of the "girl singer". Refusing to pander to any female stereotype\, O'Day presented herself as a "hip" jazz musician\, wearing a band jacket and skirt as opposed to an evening gown. She changed her surname from Colton to O'Day\, pig Latin for "dough\," slang for money. COL channel name VAL Music Legends Book	0

COL title VAL Concrete and Clay COL performer VAL The Bob Crewe Generation	COL video title VAL Hazy Osterwald - Cheek To Cheek (VintageMusic.es) COL description VAL Hazy Osterwald (* 18. Februar 1922 als Rolf Erich Osterwalder in Bern; † 26. Februar2012 in Luzern) war ein Schweizer Musiker\, Sänger und Orchesterleiter. Zu seinen bekanntesten Stücken gehören der «Kriminal-Tango» und der «Konjunktur-Cha-Cha» («Geh'n Sie mit der Konjunktur»). Osterwald\, der Sohn des Fussballnationalspielers und Buchhalters Adolf Osterwalder\, der ebenfalls den Spitznamen Hazy trug\, begeisterte sich als Schüler eher für Fussball und wurde wegen mangelnden Übens vom Klavierunterricht ausgeschlossen. Mitschüler drängten ihn aber dazu\, Pianist im Schulorchester zu werden. 1939 wurde er dessen Leiter. Ab 1940 besuchte er das Konservatorium und lernte bei Albert Moeschinger Komposition und Theorie\, daneben übte er Trompete. 1940\, ein Jahr vor seiner Matura\, arrangierte er für den Orchesterleiter Teddy Stauffer und andere. 1941 spielte er Trompete in der Band von Fred Böhler\, ab 1942 unter dem Künstlernamen «Hazy Osterwald». Bei den «Original Teddies» des Saxophonisten Eddie Brunner\, dem Nachfolger Stauffers\, spielte er 1944 Klavier und Trompete\, gründete aber im gleichen Jahr eine eigene achtköpfige Combo mit der Sängerin Kitty Ramon. Am 1. September 1944 kam das erste Engagement im Dancing Chikito in Bern. Die Erweiterung zur Bigband erwies sich als zu teuer\, und so gründete er nach dem Vorbild von Svend Asmussen am 1. Mai 1949 sein Sextett\, mit dem er noch im selben Jahr auf dem Festival International 1949 de Jazz in Paris spielte\, wo auch Grössen wie Charlie Parker und Sidney Bechet auftraten.

It was the lead single from their album Green River and was released in April 1969\, four months before the album. The song reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart for three weeks in September 1969. It was CCR's second gold single.  The song has been recorded by at least 20 different artists\, in styles ranging from folk to reggae to psychedelic rock.  In 2011\, Rolling Stone ranked it #364 on its "500 Greatest Songs of All Time" list.  Composition  Fogerty reportedly wrote "Bad Moon Rising" after watching The Devil and Daniel Webster. Inspired by a scene in the film involving a hurricane\, Fogerty claims the song is about "the apocalypse that was going to be visited upon us."  Mondegreen  The refrain in the chorus\, "there's a bad moon on the rise\," is commonly misheard as "there's a bathroom on the right". Fogerty has parodied the mishearing in live performances of the song.  Cover versions  Jerry Lee Lewis released a version of the song on his 1973 album\, The Session.  Fogerty and Lewis recorded a version together that was released on Lewis' 2010 album\, Mean Old Man.  Emmylou Harris released a version of the song on her 1981 album\, Evangeline.  A 1986 version by the Australian band the Reels reached number 11 on the Australian charts.  The Scottish traditional group Battlefield Band recorded a version for their 1987 album After Hours: Forward to Scotland's Past.  Soundtrack  The song has been used in a number of films\, including: An American Werewolf in London\, My Fellow Americans\, Twilight Zone: The Movie\, Blade\, Sweet Home Alabama\, My Girl\, Man of the House\, Mr. Woodcock and The Big Chill.  It has also appeared in many television programs\, including: Supernatural\, Cold Case\, Northern Exposure and Alvin and the Chipmunks\, in which it is performed by the titular characters.  A remixed version of the song can be heard in the video game Crackdown 2.  The song was available as a playable song for Guitar Hero 5 series of music rhythm video games as downloadable content.  Rock Band Music Gaming Platform  The song was made available to download on March 1\, 2011 for use in the Rock Band 3 music gaming platform in both Basic rhythm\, and PRO mode which takes advantage of the use of a real guitar / bass guitar\, along with standard MIDI-compatible electronic drum kits / keyboards in addition to three-part harmony vocals.

She quickly became a popular attraction. Hall left the Taft in 1940\, taking Dolly with him. In July of 1941 he grew weary of leading a band and turned over his orchestra to Dolly\, renaming it Dolly Dawn and her Dawn Patrol. Dolly was successful leading the group\, but the stress of the job soon got to her. Her singing career was doing quite well\, and she found it easier to book herself solo than with the band. In March of 1942 she gave up the orchestra. COL channel name VAL warholsoup100	0

Original Billboard review of this single: "The new singer on the label (Capitol) bows in strongly as he warbles an intimate ballad about a couple of lovers.

A budge label or drugstore label as they were sometimes called.  This is another 25 cent record I found at the flea market\, that had to be thoroughly cleaned.  At least the album cover didn't fall apart on this one like the other one\, but it had no labels  when I removed it from the album.  I found them in like new condition inside the album\, maybe they were so budgeted you had to affix your own labels\, which I'll do with some 3M adhesive. The Johnny Mann singers were mostly found on  Liberty records.   Played on an Onkyo turntable with a Pickering XUV 4500Q cartridge\, and direclty uploaded to the PC COL channel name VAL maynardcat	1

Welle: Erdball -- Ganz In Weiß  ------------------------  "Walk on the Wild Side" is a Lou Reed song from his 1972 second solo album Transformer. It was produced by David Bowie. The song received wide radio coverage\, despite its touching on taboo topics such as transsexuality\, drugs\, male prostitutes and oral sex and the term "colored" to refer to African Americans. In the United States\, RCA released an edited version of song as a single which eliminated the song's reference to oral sex.  It is usually regarded as Reed's best-known solo work. The song reached #16 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100\, and #10 in the UK. In 2003\, the song was ranked #221 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.  Covers  This song was covered by Company B\, on their album "Jam on Me." In February 1990\, two club/hiphop versions charted simultaneously in the UK - Jamie J. Morgan's cover produced by Richard Mazda reached #27\, whilst Beat System got to #63. In 1985\, 79-year old veteran German actress Gerty Molzen recorded her own version of the song\, cleaning up some of the lyrics in the process. She performed it on the David Letterman show in the US and on Gay Byrne's Late Late Show in Ireland. Echo & the Bunnymen usually merge this in concert with Nothing Lasts Forever. A 2005 song by artist RX featured George W. Bush "singing" a mixture of John Lennon's "Imagine" and the chorus from "Walk on the Wild Side". Irish/Australian comedian Jimeoin covered the song in 1993 on his music/comedy CD\, Goin' Off. The song featured the line "You should have seen them go go go\, I said G-O-G-G-O\, take a walk on the wildside" as a reference to the popular Yellow Pages ad on TV at the time. The Strokes and Robbie Williams played the full song or a snippet during their last tours. The band Sponge have been known to break into the song in the middle of playing their hit "Have You Seen Mary?" in live performances. The Rentals also play it live before transitioning into their hit "Friends of P". Train sings this song for the Bay Area's local station KFOG\, on a CD called Live From The Archives: Vol. 11\, as a part of the KFOG Kaboom Medley. A short part of the song was often used by Bono during performances of Bad in the mid eighties. Most notably performed at Live Aid in London. At a charity event\, Lou Reed played this song with comedians Conan O'Brien\, Jimmy Fallon\, Adam Sandler\, and Jack Black. Each person took on one verse of the song. Vanessa Paradis covered the song in her album Variations sur le même t'aime. Jesse Malin covered it on On Your Sleeve\, a cover album released in 2008. Young@Heart\, an entertainment group created by and for the elderly\, composed of people at least 70 years of age\, perform this song in concert. Moby includes the song in his concerts. During Exit Festival 2009\, he referred to it as "his favourite song about New York." Editors covered this song on 2007. Cover can be found on album Rhythms del Mundo Classics. Australian band Yves Klein Blue covered the song on the radio segment 'Like a Version' on Triple J in 2010 Trumpeter Rick Braun covered the song from 2005 album "Yours Truly." The German group Tok Tok Tok covers this song in their album "I wish" in 2005. The French group Pink Turtle gives this song a Jazz Age twist in their album "Reprise! When jazz meets pop #3" (2007).  Media Appearances  In a scene from the film Hedwig and the Angry Inch Hedwig starts singing it while in an oven. This song is usually the opening to Danny Masterson's LA radio show\, "Feel My Heat". Natalie Portman sings the line "And the colored girls go Doo\, doo\, doo\, doo\, doo\, doo\, doo\, doo" in the film Beautiful Girls. In the television show Medium\, the episode "Lady Killer" featured the tune of "Walk on the Wild side" (with no lyrics) during Patricia Arquette's character's dreams about a woman seducing men\, and perhaps gave a clue to who the actual killer was. The bassline of this song is used in the Gatorade G2 commercial. In the movie Guess Who this song is playing on the radio while Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher are driving in the car. In the film The Salton Sea an old man with a tracheotomy sings the song on a karaoke machine in a bar. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

Although all of these seven natural wonders are still in existence today\, and are still being adored by many tourists across the globe\, the New7Wonders Foundation launched a campaign in 2007 to select a new list of natural wonders. The declaration of the New Seven Natural Wonders of the World will take place in 2011.  The Following is CNN list of seven breathtaking wonders of the world created by nature itself\, in random order:  1. Magical dancing lights\, performing through the night! -- AURORA BOREALIS (Alaska) 2. A thousand tiny islands in one mountain cupped bay\, no way! -- HARBOR OF RIO DE JANEIRO (Brazil) 3. A canyon so vast\, and carved out of the past! -- GRAND CANYON (USA) 4. A giant coral reef\, with fish beyond belief! -- GREAT BARRIER REEF (Australia) 5.  A mountain so high it almost reaches the sky! -- MOUNT EVEREST (Himalayas) 6.  A volcano that grew\, nearly right in front of you! -- PARICUTIN VOLCANO (Mexico) 7.  Falls so tall\, a dinosaur would feel small! - VICTORIA FALLS (South Africa)       ~Planetpals~ ---------------------------------------------------- DADDY'S LOVE (an acrostic poem)  Daddy's love\, so beautiful Aurora\, you're colorful\, but not as wonderful Daddy's love\, can never be detached Deep Grand Canyon\, you're so vast\, but not a match  Yesterdays\, today and into tomorrows Surpassing all sorrow 'though times are borrowed Love of Daddy\, so solid\, like Mount Kilimanjaro Only his love is indestructible and so magical Victoria Falls\, you're fantastic\, but you don't have his magic  Endless love and wind beneath my wings\, that's my Daddy!  ~I love you\, Daddy! Happy Father's Day - From WhiteLibraTexas~ ----------------------------------------------------------  I picked the featured song\, "Wind Beneath My Wings\," to dedicate to the coolest father on earth\, my Daddy\, and to all the wonderful fathers across the globe\, too.

COL title VAL Cottage for Sale COL performer VAL Jack Teagarden	COL video title VAL Shirley Bassey - Johnny One Note (1976 Show #1) COL description VAL 1976 (Shirley performs this classic Rodgers & Hart Big Band Style Number 'Johnny One Note' with her own uniquely powerful style\, which is from the Musical 'Babes In Arms\,'  Shirley performed this song on her 1976 TV Variety Show.  Shirley recorded and released this song on her 1966 LP titled\, 'Shirley Bassey - I've Got A Song For You'.  ABOUT Johnny One Note: "Johnny One Note" is a 1937 show tune from the 1937 Rodgers and Hart musical Babes in Arms\, where it was introduced by Wynn Murrary. Judy Garland sang it in the film version\, released in 1939.  The musical contained more great songs Shirley Bassey has also performed: "The Lady Is A Tramp"\, "Where Or When" and "My Funny Valentine".  The 'Babes In Arms' story is about a group of vaudevillians who want to revive their old fashioned form of entertainement by doing a roadshow. "Johnny One Note" is sung as a bedtimestory. A kind of fairy tale about a very ego-centred singer who is so very loud that nobody can hear the soprano. This lady singer asks her godmother to put a spell on Johnny\, so that the next time he wants to impress everybody by holding his note as long as possible he has to held it forever.  Shirley Bassey wrote about "Johnny One Note":   I don't always recognize the right songs for me the first time I hear them. For a long time I was asked to do 'Johnny One Note'\, but I couldn't do it for many\, many years. Then one day Eddie Fisher's musical director just sat at the piano and said\, 'This is a good song for you'\, and started playing 'Johnny One Note'. The way he played it\, I got so excited\, but I said 'I can't do this song'. 'Why not?' he asked. 'Well\, when I was discovered\, the girl whose place I took in the show\, she had a big hit with this song and I've never been able to touch this song.' 'Well\, try it\,' he said. And I was amazed when I opened my mouth: this voice came out singing this song as though it was mine. So\, after all those years - it was about ten years\, I believe - when we actually got down to it\, it was a piece of cake.  LYRICS: Johnny could only sing one note  And the note he sang was this: aaaahh  Poor Johnny One Note  Sang out with Gusto A nd just overloaded the place Poor Johnny One Note  Yelled willy-nilly  Until he was blue in the face For holding one note was his ace  Couldn't hear the brass  Couldn't hear the drum He was in a class  By himself\, by gum Poor Johnny One Note  Got in Aida indeed a great chance to be brave He took his one note  Howled like the North Wind  Brought forth wind that made critics rave While Verdi turned round in his grave  Couldn't hear the flute  Or the big trombone Everyone was mute  Johnny stood alone Cats and dogs stopped yapping  Lions in the zoo  Were all jealous of Johnny's big thrill Thunderclaps stopped clapping  Traffic ceased its roar  And they tell us Niag'ra stood still He stopped the trainwistles  Boatwhistles  Steamwhistles  Copwhistles All whistles bowed to his skill  Sing Johnny One Note Sing out with gusto  And just overwhelm all the crowd  Aaaahh   So sing\, Johnny One Note out loud  Sing\, Johnny One Note  Sing -  Johnny -  One Note -  Out loud  ABOUT the LP\, I've Got A Song For You: I've Got a Song for You is a 1966 album by Shirley Bassey. Bassey had left EMI's Columbia Label\, and this was her first album for United Artists\, a label she would remain with for approximately 14 years. This album and the following release And We Were Lovers were produced by Bassey's former husband\, Kenneth Hume. (Their marriage had ended in divorce in 1965\, but he continued to act as her manager\, and for these two albums\, her producer.) The album entered the UK Albums Chart at #26\, but only remained on the chart for one week\, and failed to chart in the US\, despite her having received outstanding reviews for live engagements in New York and Las Vegas that same year\, and the fact that the album was recorded in New York.

COL title VAL Your Song COL performer VAL Yellowism	COL video title VAL Sonny & Cher - You Don't Love Me COL description VAL Sonny & Cher proved one of the magical musical combinations of the mid '60s and one of the better rock-influenced MOR acts of the early '70s\, their wisecracking repartee providing counterpoint to a series of adoring hit duets. Salvatore "Sonny" Bono (b. Feb. 16\, 1935) started out at Los Angeles-based Specialty Records as a songwriter in the late '50s\, responsible for "Koko Joe" by Don and Dewey and "She Said Yeah" for Larry Williams\, which was later covered by the Rolling Stones and the Righteous Brothers. Bono became a protégé of Phil Spector\, managing to write a handful of successful songs\, most notably "Needles and Pins" in collaboration with his protégé Jack Nitzsche\, which became a success for Jackie DeShannon and a huge international hit for the Searchers. In 1964\, while working sessions with Phil Spector\, he met an 18-year-old would-be singer named Cherilyn Lapierre (b. May 20\, 1946)\, and the two were later married. They formed a professional duet\, initially as Caesar and Cleo for Vault Records and later Reprise\, but it was only after they were signed to Atlantic Records as Sonny & Cher that success came their way. The couple embarked on parallel careers\, with Cher later signed to Liberty/Imperial Records as a solo act. She subsequently hit with "Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)" while Sonny charted with "Laugh at Me" on Atco\, but their biggest success was as a duet on Atco\, with "I Got You Babe" and "The Beat Goes On."  For a time\, from 1965 until 1967\, they were rock & roll's hottest couple\, so much so that in some conservative communities they were considered almost morally subversive; parents locked up their kids when Sonny and Cher were passing through for a concert appearance. They were popular enough\, and sufficiently well-known in their images that the Rolling Stones impersonated them on the British television music showcase Ready Steady Go\, miming to "I Got You Babe" with Brian Jones subbing for Sonny.  And then nothing -- the hits stopped coming\, and the couple made some daringly creative but unsuccessful commercial missteps\, even a movie (Good Times\, directed by William Friedkin in his debut) that was\, like the Monkees' Head\, too far ahead of its time for critics or all but the most advanced fans to appreciate. A further film effort\, Chastity\, a name shared by their daughter\, also bombed\, and the sudden confrontation of a $200\,000 income tax debt forced the couple to continue working. Further\, they were unable to record because of a dispute with Atlantic over Sonny's objections to the way that Cher's solo career was being handled.  They were playing supper clubs and Las Vegas nightclubs when Johnny Musso\, a friend of the couple's\, was jumping from an executive position at Atlantic to run Decca Records' Kapp label subsidiary\, and brought the duo with him. At around the same time\, their stage act -- which had evolved into a kind of "with it" domestic comedy routine nearly as prominent as the music\, with the tall\, wry-witted Cher cutting up on the seemingly dim-witted Sonny -- was spotted by Fred Silverman\, who was then the head of programming for CBS. They ended up with a summer replacement try-out show that did so well that Sonny & Cher were given a regular spot in the CBS lineup in January 1972 with a comedy-variety series.  The couple's recording career was revived initially by a live album cut in one night at Las Vegas\, featuring new versions of their early hits as well as parts of their current repertory; the album went gold. The first couple of singles by Cher and Sonny & Cher failed\, but then producer Snuff Garrett\, who had been at Liberty when Cher was there but had never worked with her\, was brought in\, and the result was "Gypsies\, Tramps and Thieves\," a career-reviving number one hit. After that\, "The Way of Love\," "All I Ever Need Is You" (which became the theme for their TV show)\, "A Cowboy's Work Is Never Done\," "Half Breed\," and "Dark Lady" kept either Cher or the couple in the Top Ten at various times through 1974. By then\, however\, their marriage had fallen apart\, and with it\, the success of their TV show. ~ Bruce Eder\, All Music Guide COL channel name VAL Sonny And Chers Channel	0

Every Breath You Take 11. Take On Me 12. Ace of Spades 13. Seven Nation Army 14. Angels 15. Rebel Yell  ------------------------  "Seven Nation Army" is the first track on the album Elephant by American alternative rock band The White Stripes. It was released as a single in 2003. Seven Nation Army reached #1 on the Modern Rock Tracks for three weeks and won 2004's Grammy Award for Best Rock Song. The song is known for its underlying riff\, which plays throughout most of the song. Although it sounds like a bass guitar (an instrument the group had famously never previously used)\, the sound is actually created by running Jack White's semi-acoustic guitar (a 1950s style Kay Hollowbody) through a Digitech Whammy pedal set down an octave. The riff was composed at a sound check before a show at the Corner Hotel in Melbourne\, Australia\, according to the set notes in the booklet which accompanied the Under Blackpool Lights DVD. This riff was inspired by the main theme of Anton Bruckner's Fifth symphony.  According to White\, "Seven Nation Army" is what he used to call the Salvation Army as a child. The song ranked #1 on UpVenue's 10 best The White Stripes songs.  Critical  This song was number six on Rolling Stone's 2009 list of the 50 Best Songs of the Decade. In March 2005\, Q magazine placed "Seven Nation Army" at number 8 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks. In September 2005\, NME placed "Seven Nation Army" at number 5 in its list of the 50 Greatest Tracks Of The Decade. It was also called the 75th greatest hard rock song by VH1. In May 2008\, Rolling Stone placed this song at number 21 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time. "Seven Nation Army" also earned 20th place in Triple J's Hottest 100 of All Time in 2009. The song was also listed at #30 on Pitchfork Media's top 500 songs of the 2000s\, and at number 2 in Observer Music Monthly's top 75 songs of the decade\, behind Beyoncé's "Crazy in Love". It also came in second on Channel V Australia's top 1000 songs of the 00s. In 2009\, US website Consequence of Sound named this as their top rock track of the 2000s\, as did Boston's WFNX Radio. On Rolling Stone's updated version of their The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\, "Seven Nation Army" was listed at number 286. It was also ranked #1 on Rhapsody's list of the Top 100 Tracks of the Decade.  Cover versions  The song has been covered by the country music group The Oak Ridge Boys\, Funk Metal band Living Colour\, Rock supergroup Audioslave\, Alice Russell\, Nostalgia 77\, The Dynamics\, Flaming Lips\, Ben l'Oncle Soul\, Tomer G\, Kate Nash\, Nataly Dawn\, Kelly Clarkson\, OneRepublic\, Weezer\, The Strange\, Silent Thunder\, The Red Coats and many others.

The song was originally recorded by Dionne Warwick.  Charting versions  "Walk On By" has charted numerous times in various countries\, with wildly different arrangements. The following entries discuss the chart versions of the song\, in the order in which they appeared:  Dionne Warwick version  The original version of "Walk On By" was recorded at the same December 1963 session that yielded "Anyone Who Had a Heart"\, which\, in 1964\, became Warwick's second Top Ten hit. Released in April of that year\, "Walk on By" reached #6 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and #1 on the Cashbox's R&B chart. (Billboard did not print rhythm and blues charts during 1964\, the year of the song's peak performance.) The song also reached the top 10 in a brief run on Billboard's easy listening survey.  Warwick also recorded a German version of the song\, entitled "Geh Vorbei".  Isaac Hayes version  Funk/soul musician Isaac Hayes released a cover version in 1969 on his album Hot Buttered Soul and transformed the song into a twelve-and-a-half minute funk vamp. Edited for single release down to under 5 minutes\, this single reached #30 on the U.S. charts.  The Stranglers version  In 1978\, The Stranglers recorded a gritty punk-inspired version (with an extended organ solo) that hit #21 on the UK charts.  D-Train version  In 1982\, funk duo D-Train recorded a UK and U.S. R&B/dance hit with the song in a boogie/funk cover.  Jo Jo Zep version  In 1983\, Australian act Jo Jo Zep covered the song in a slow\, moody version that featured electronics and synthesizers. The track was a minor hit in Australia\, peaking at #55\, but was a major hit in New Zealand\, hitting #6.  Sybil version  In 1990\, singer Sybil\, who had scored her biggest hit a year prior with a cover of Warwick's "Don't Make Me Over\," also scored a U.S. and UK hit with "Walk On By."  Gabrielle version  In 1997\, UK singer Gabrielle released her version of "Walk on By" as the fifth and final single from her album\, Gabrielle. It reached #7 in the UK.  Cyndi Lauper version  "Walk on By" was the first single from Cyndi Lauper's 2003 covers album\, At Last. It was also included on Lauper's 2004 DVD Live at Last. It was released as a promo only. Remixes of the song reached #10 on the U.S. dance chart.  Seal version  Seal released a version of "Walk On By" as a single in January 2005. Though the song did not chart in his native UK\, it made the lower reaches of the charts in several European countries\, including #57 in Austria\, #49 in Germany\, and #46 in Switzerland.  Other versions  Alan Price Alicia Keys recorded a hip hop version of the song on 2003 mutli-platinum album The Diary of Alicia Keys Aretha Franklin Average White Band The Beach Boys covered the song in a studio outtake for their 1969 album\, 20/20.

She developed an interest in jazz from an early age\, through her father's collection of 78rpm records\, becoming "obsessed" with big band singers like Ella Fitzgerald and big bands like Joe Loss.  "I Only Have Eyes for You" is a popular romantic love song by composer Harry Warren and lyricist Al Dubin\, written in 1934. The song is a jazz standard\, and has been covered by thousands of musicians. -Lyrics - Are the stars out tonight? I don't know if it's cloudy or bright 'Cause I only have eyes for you\, dear The moon may be high But I can't see a thing in the sky 'Cause I only have eyes for you. I don't know if we're in a garden Or on a crowded avenue You are here\, so am I Maybe millions of people go by But they all disappear from view And I only have eyes for you I don't know if we're in a garden Or on a crowded avenue You are here\, so am I Maybe millions of people go by But they all disappear from view And I only have eyes for you.  - Song and images belong to their respective owners - COL channel name VAL Dreamer8girl	1

COL title VAL Steel Guitar Rag COL performer VAL Hank Thompson	COL video title VAL George Barnes -- Adios COL description VAL George Barnes era uno de los guitarristas más prolíficos y versátiles de los años cincuenta y sesenta. Aunque\, básicamente era un hombre de jazz\, era un maestro de todos los estilos: blues\, country\, folk\, pop\, R & R\, R & B. Fue uno de los primeros en grabar con la guitarra eléctrica y Chet Atkins\, Les Paul y Charlie Christian le han citado como una fuente de inspiración principal.  A la edad de 14 años\, Barnes ya era un músico profesional y  había formado su propio cuarteto George Barnes. Dos años más tarde grabó sus primeros discos consu propio nombre: "I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles" and "I Can't Believe That You're In Love With Me" para el sello Okeh. En 1938 estaba trabajando para la NBC\, como director de orquesta\, guitarrista y arreglista. Tras su paso por el ejército durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial\, Barnes volvió a su trabajo de estudio y grabó transcripciones de radio con su octeto inusual.  En 1951 se trasladó de Chicago a Nueva York\, donde de inmediato consiguió un contrato con Decca para grabar sus propios álbumes. George también se reunió con Carl Kress en 1951\, el comienzo de una amistad que iba a dar lugar a una  formación aclamada por la crítica. Recorrieron el mundo juntos e hicieron algunas de las mejores grabaciones de dúos de guitarra de la historia.  En este tiempo\, George tenía  la Guild Guitar Company dedicada a construir una guitarra única bajo sus especificaciones. Tras la muerte de Kress en 1965\, la  próxima pareja de George iba a ser Bucky Pizzarelli. Como músico de estudio\, Barnes ha trabajado con todos\, desde Louis Armstrong a Bob Dylan.  iTunes: http://itunes.apple.com/es/album/guitar-galaxies/id476374761  Síguenos en: Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/vintagem.es Spotify: http://open.spotify.com/user/vintagemusic Web: http://www.vintagemusic.es BoutiqAlia: http://boutiqalia.com/store/vintage/ (compra física de CD) Compra nuestros Cd's en formato físico en estas plataformas: Ebay:  http://stores.ebay.com/VintageMusicFm BoutiqAlia: www.boutiqalia-vintagemusic.com Síguenos en: Spotify: https://goo.gl/raouHQ Facebook: https://goo.gl/L92BHL Instagram: https://goo.gl/3oYDGH Web: http://www.vintagemusic.es   Compra nuestros Cd's en formato físico en estas plataformas: Ebay:  http://stores.ebay.com/VintageMusicFm BoutiqAlia: www.boutiqalia-vintagemusic.com Discogs: https://www.discogs.com/es/seller/vintagemusicfm/profile COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm	0

COL title VAL Any Way That You Want Me COL performer VAL Evie Sands	COL video title VAL Fly Me To The Moon - David Carroll Orchestra COL description VAL BEST SOUND AT 720p.  Fly Me To The Moon by the David Carroll Orchestra from the 1962 mono Mercury Lp titled Today's Top Hits.  Played on a Sony TTS-3000 an SME 3009 Mark 11 tonearm with an Ortofon 10 cartridge.  Sadie usually sleeps through video making\, but wanted in on the act for some reason this time.   She has her own bed on the other side of the room\, but likes being on the other stool beside the turntable during video making and never bothers anything.  She likes videos for cats\, and became really excited seeing herself on the monitor. She is so interested in the computer that she gets in the way a lot when I'm trying to use it  trying to see if there is anything on that she might want to watch. COL channel name VAL maynardcat	0

It features some artificial harmonics\, a playing style invented by Chet Atkins and Lenny Breau. He was one of the most gifted players ever and was a good friend of Chet Atkins\, who was his mentor!  He never got the fame he deserved. Unfortunately he died in 2002 because of his alcohol addiction  There is too little stuff of Tommy on youtube. This video was once posted here on youtube but the uploader took it down. Fans of Chet Atkins\, Lenny Breau or Tommy Emmanuel will love him! COL channel name VAL rarestuff87	0

I was just\, I was just\,  I was just sitting here thinking  Of your kiss and your warm embrace\,  When the reflection in the glass that I held to my lips\, baby  Revealed the tears that was on my face.   And  Baby\, Baby\, I'd rather be blind\, boy\,  Than to see you walk away from me. COL channel name VAL CynicalHippie	0

COL title VAL The Breeze and I COL performer VAL Gene Ammons	COL video title VAL Wilson Pickett - Hey Jude (w/ Duane Allman) COL description VAL Before there was The Allman Brothers Band\, Duane Allman was trying to attract any kind of attention and make a name for himself. The music business is hard you know. Though immortalized now as one of the greatest guitarist of all time\, it was Gregg who was more sought out in the record business in the early days. So Duane made ends meet by being a session guitarist in studios while he decided what his next move would be.  It was in November of 1968\, when Wilson Pickett - already a star - showed up at Rick Halls Fame Studio in Muscle Shoals\, AL wanting to record\, but with no material or ideas. Duane\, who was working for Rick but was not even the main\, lead session guitarist\, suggested that they cut "Hey Jude"\, which Rick thought was "the most preposterous thing" he had ever heard and Wilson agreed they would NOT do it. The Beatles had just recently released it and it was climbing the charts. But Duane somehow convinced them both it was a good idea because it "was" a Beatles song and it "would" be Number 1. And\, as you hear\, it was a GREAT idea. This song sparked the beginning of Duane's future nickname and the formation of ABB.  The story goes that Duane was already known as "Dog" because of his looks. As you might imagine\, the hippie look that Duane sported was few and far between in late 1960's Alabama. When Wilson heard the way Duane played he started calling him "Sky Man". Not just for his "out of this world" playing but also for his "out of this world" state of mind he liked being in (recreational activities for those who still don't get it). From there the name somewhere morphed into "Skydog". Rick Hall was also so amazed that he phoned Jerry Wexler and put the phone up to the speakers on the playback so he could hear the song. Needless to say\, he was also blown away by Duane's playing. And in Wilson's defense of this DA story\, his vocals in this song are what they are in all his songs -- AWESOME.  Jerry Wexler was Wilson's main producer for Atlantic who wasn't able to be there and gave the reins to Hall. Wexler\, along with Phil Walden\, later in '69\, started Capricorn Records in Macon\, GA and we all know that story. Also\, Phil Walden is also the man who introduced and brought in Jaimoe to play with Duane. They started jamming together before any of the other Brothers joined in.  Well anyway - this is for your listening pleasure and hope you enjoy it. If you want to know more of this story\, I highly recommend pp. 80-88 of "Skydog: The Duane Allman Story" by Randy Poe. It is where this info came from and it is the best book ever if you are a Duane and/or ABB fan. And the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section...thank you...you helped change the world and the music for the better. COL channel name VAL MrElDuderino85	0

Overseen by Chicago producers Charlie "Baby" Rosario and Manfred Mohr (whose 20 Fingers Productions would later score with the cheeky club hit "Short Dick Man")\, Max-A-Million's lone release was 1995's Take Your Time. The title track\, a cover of the S.O.S. Band's 1980 hit\, struck gold again in its updated form\, becoming a worldwide dancefloor sensation. Max-A-Million followed up the success of Take Your Time with a cover version of the Marvin Gaye classic "Sexual Healing." The original song's undeniable groove helped Max-A-Million's rather tepid rehash find legs\, and Take Your Time was well on its way to platinum status. COL channel name VAL UnidiscMusic	0

It was released on 1 July 1977 as the third single from their only album\, Never Mind the Bollocks\, Here's the Sex Pistols. The song marked the band's only appearance on the British music show Top of the Pops. The song is infamous for vocalist John Lydon's phrasing of the word "vacant"\, emphasizing the last syllable making it sound like the swear word "cunt". According to Glen Matlock the riff was inspired by "S.O.S." by ABBA after hearing it on the radio. The B-side is a cover of The Stooges' "No Fun" which they played on the spot without a proper rehearsal.  New Musical Express (NME) magazine made it their Single of the Year in 1977. In March 2005\, Q magazine placed the song at number 26 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks.  Covers and samples  Joey Ramone used the lead riff in his cover of "What a Wonderful World".  South African pop group Shikisha released a cover version of the song in 1996.  The French band Les Négresses Vertes as well as grime MC Lady Sovereign have both covered "Pretty Vacant" and performed live versions of the song. Lady Sovereign's version is featured in the popular TV show\, The O.C. and the cover version is featured on one of the six The O.C. soundtracks called Music from The O.C.: Mix 6 -- Covering Our Tracks.  Joan Jett released a cover version on single.  In popular culture  This song is on the soundtrack to the 2010 The Runaways film of the same name.  This song is on the soundtrack to the video game skate.  The second reissue of this song entitled "Pretty Vacant (Guitar Hero Version)" was released on iTunes for download on 16 October 2007. This version of the song is included in Guitar Hero World Tour.  "Pretty Vacant" was used as the theme song to a short-lived 1994 television sketch comedy show called The Vacant Lot.  The song was featured in the 1981 Ralph Bakshi movie American Pop.  Chris Miles\, an important character of Skins\, has a T-shirt that says "pretty vacant" in various episodes.  ------------------------  Lyrics  There's no point in asking\, you'll get no reply. And just remember I don't decide I got no reason it's all too much You'll always find us.. out to lunch.  We're so pretty Oh so pretty we're vacant. We're so pretty Oh so pretty A vacant.

COL title VAL My Mother's Eyes COL performer VAL Frankie Valley	COL video title VAL Bobby Scott  "Nature Boy"      (1990) COL description VAL In 1941\, a 33 year old George McGrew arrived in Los Angeles and began playing piano in the Eutropheon\, a small health food store and raw food restaurant on Laurel Canyon Boulevard. The cafe was owned by John and Vera Richter\, German immigrants who followed a Naturmensch and Lebensreform philosophy influenced by the Wandervogel movement in Germany.Their followers\, known as "Nature Boys"\, wore long hair and beards and ate only raw fruits and vegetables. McGrew adopted the philosophy and chose the name "eden ahbez"\, writing and spelling his name with lower-case letters. It was there while living in a cave near Palm Springs\, ahbez wrote "Nature Boy". Partly autobiographical\, the song was a tribute to his mentor Bill Pester\, who had originally introduced him to Naturmensch and Lebensreform.  In 1947\, at the prompting of Cowboy Jack Patton and Johnny Mercer\, ahbez approached Nat King Cole's manager backstage at the Lincoln Theater in Los Angeles\, handed him a tattered copy of "Nature Boy"\, and asked him to show it to Cole. However his pleas were ignored and a disappointed ahbez left the sheet music of "Nature Boy" with Cole's valet\, Otis Pollard. From him Cole came to know of the song and after reading it\, the singer loved it and began playing "Nature Boy" for live audiences to much acclaim. Irving Berlin\, who was present in the crowd\, had initially offered to buy the track from Cole. But he decided to record the track for himself and needed to get permission from ahbez before releasing it as a single. After ahbez was discovered living under the Hollywood Sign\, Cole got his permission and recorded the song COL channel name VAL nyronut	0

Rebel Yell  ------------------------  "Seven Nation Army" is the first track on the album Elephant by American alternative rock band The White Stripes. It was released as a single in 2003. Seven Nation Army reached #1 on the Modern Rock Tracks for three weeks and won 2004's Grammy Award for Best Rock Song. The song is known for its underlying riff\, which plays throughout most of the song. Although it sounds like a bass guitar (an instrument the group had famously never previously used)\, the sound is actually created by running Jack White's semi-acoustic guitar (a 1950s style Kay Hollowbody) through a Digitech Whammy pedal set down an octave. The riff was composed at a sound check before a show at the Corner Hotel in Melbourne\, Australia\, according to the set notes in the booklet which accompanied the Under Blackpool Lights DVD. This riff was inspired by the main theme of Anton Bruckner's Fifth symphony.  According to White\, "Seven Nation Army" is what he used to call the Salvation Army as a child. The song ranked #1 on UpVenue's 10 best The White Stripes songs.  Critical  This song was number six on Rolling Stone's 2009 list of the 50 Best Songs of the Decade. In March 2005\, Q magazine placed "Seven Nation Army" at number 8 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks. In September 2005\, NME placed "Seven Nation Army" at number 5 in its list of the 50 Greatest Tracks Of The Decade. It was also called the 75th greatest hard rock song by VH1. In May 2008\, Rolling Stone placed this song at number 21 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time. "Seven Nation Army" also earned 20th place in Triple J's Hottest 100 of All Time in 2009. The song was also listed at #30 on Pitchfork Media's top 500 songs of the 2000s\, and at number 2 in Observer Music Monthly's top 75 songs of the decade\, behind Beyoncé's "Crazy in Love". It also came in second on Channel V Australia's top 1000 songs of the 00s. In 2009\, US website Consequence of Sound named this as their top rock track of the 2000s\, as did Boston's WFNX Radio. On Rolling Stone's updated version of their The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\, "Seven Nation Army" was listed at number 286. It was also ranked #1 on Rhapsody's list of the Top 100 Tracks of the Decade.  Cover versions  The song has been covered by the country music group The Oak Ridge Boys\, Funk Metal band Living Colour\, Rock supergroup Audioslave\, Alice Russell\, Nostalgia 77\, The Dynamics\, Flaming Lips\, Ben l'Oncle Soul\, Tomer G\, Kate Nash\, Nataly Dawn\, Kelly Clarkson\, OneRepublic\, Weezer\, The Strange\, Silent Thunder\, The Red Coats and many others.

COL title VAL If I Should Lose You COL performer VAL Nat "King" Cole	COL video title VAL Patti Smith - Land: Horses\, Land of A Thousand Dances\, La Mer (De) COL description VAL This song\, from Patti's most famous album; Horses\, is a classic example of her music. Spoken-word poetry style lyrics underpinned by 3 chord rock embellished with complex & subtle instrumentals. Perfect.  None of this content belongs to me\, all respect and love to those it does. I have created this video from material belonging to others under fair use laws out of love and admiration for the musicians/film makers involved. The album was a huge influence on the New York punk scene (Not every punk band sounds like The Sex Pistols.) While most punk expounded a pragmatic ethos\, with simple instrumentals\, short songs\, simple lyrics\, deriving power through repetition like a protest\, Patti used complex arrangements and varied instrumental accompaniments and ambiguous lyrics. Anyway\, all that music history and theory bullshit aside\, this song rocks!  I made the video from The Tracey Fragments\, a film made by Bruce McDonald\, (starring Ellen Page) a slightly avant-garde Canadian director\, who made all the material for the film available to download and welcomed fans of his to edit the film into whatever they wanted. P.s Ellen is apparently a huge fan of Patti! COL channel name VAL andMaskellshrugged	0

Welle: Erdball -- Ganz In Weiß  ------------------------  "Walk on the Wild Side" is a Lou Reed song from his 1972 second solo album Transformer. It was produced by David Bowie. The song received wide radio coverage\, despite its touching on taboo topics such as transsexuality\, drugs\, male prostitutes and oral sex and the term "colored" to refer to African Americans. In the United States\, RCA released an edited version of song as a single which eliminated the song's reference to oral sex.  It is usually regarded as Reed's best-known solo work. The song reached #16 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100\, and #10 in the UK. In 2003\, the song was ranked #221 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.  Covers  This song was covered by Company B\, on their album "Jam on Me." In February 1990\, two club/hiphop versions charted simultaneously in the UK - Jamie J. Morgan's cover produced by Richard Mazda reached #27\, whilst Beat System got to #63. In 1985\, 79-year old veteran German actress Gerty Molzen recorded her own version of the song\, cleaning up some of the lyrics in the process. She performed it on the David Letterman show in the US and on Gay Byrne's Late Late Show in Ireland. Echo & the Bunnymen usually merge this in concert with Nothing Lasts Forever. A 2005 song by artist RX featured George W. Bush "singing" a mixture of John Lennon's "Imagine" and the chorus from "Walk on the Wild Side". Irish/Australian comedian Jimeoin covered the song in 1993 on his music/comedy CD\, Goin' Off. The song featured the line "You should have seen them go go go\, I said G-O-G-G-O\, take a walk on the wildside" as a reference to the popular Yellow Pages ad on TV at the time. The Strokes and Robbie Williams played the full song or a snippet during their last tours. The band Sponge have been known to break into the song in the middle of playing their hit "Have You Seen Mary?" in live performances. The Rentals also play it live before transitioning into their hit "Friends of P". Train sings this song for the Bay Area's local station KFOG\, on a CD called Live From The Archives: Vol. 11\, as a part of the KFOG Kaboom Medley. A short part of the song was often used by Bono during performances of Bad in the mid eighties. Most notably performed at Live Aid in London. At a charity event\, Lou Reed played this song with comedians Conan O'Brien\, Jimmy Fallon\, Adam Sandler\, and Jack Black. Each person took on one verse of the song. Vanessa Paradis covered the song in her album Variations sur le même t'aime. Jesse Malin covered it on On Your Sleeve\, a cover album released in 2008. Young@Heart\, an entertainment group created by and for the elderly\, composed of people at least 70 years of age\, perform this song in concert. Moby includes the song in his concerts. During Exit Festival 2009\, he referred to it as "his favourite song about New York." Editors covered this song on 2007. Cover can be found on album Rhythms del Mundo Classics. Australian band Yves Klein Blue covered the song on the radio segment 'Like a Version' on Triple J in 2010 Trumpeter Rick Braun covered the song from 2005 album "Yours Truly." The German group Tok Tok Tok covers this song in their album "I wish" in 2005. The French group Pink Turtle gives this song a Jazz Age twist in their album "Reprise! When jazz meets pop #3" (2007).  Media Appearances  In a scene from the film Hedwig and the Angry Inch Hedwig starts singing it while in an oven. This song is usually the opening to Danny Masterson's LA radio show\, "Feel My Heat". Natalie Portman sings the line "And the colored girls go Doo\, doo\, doo\, doo\, doo\, doo\, doo\, doo" in the film Beautiful Girls. In the television show Medium\, the episode "Lady Killer" featured the tune of "Walk on the Wild side" (with no lyrics) during Patricia Arquette's character's dreams about a woman seducing men\, and perhaps gave a clue to who the actual killer was. The bassline of this song is used in the Gatorade G2 commercial. In the movie Guess Who this song is playing on the radio while Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher are driving in the car. In the film The Salton Sea an old man with a tracheotomy sings the song on a karaoke machine in a bar. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

COL title VAL He Ain't Heavy\, He's My Brother COL performer VAL Neil Diamond	COL video title VAL Via della Povertà [Desolation row] - Fabrizio De Andrè COL description VAL 1974 Canzoni ♫    Via della povertà  Testo italiano Fabrizio De André e Francesco De Gregori -Testo e Musica di Bob Dylan)  Autori: Fabrizio De Andrè ad eccezione di "Via della Povertà" De Andre'/De Gregori/Dylan; "Le passanti"\, "Morire per delle idee" e Deitto di paese De Andre'/Brassens; "Suzanne" e "Giovanna D'Arco" De Andre'/Cohen; "Valzer per un amore" De Andre'/Cohen..    Via della povertà    (versione LIVE eseguita a Viareggio nei primi anni "80)   Il Salone di bellezza in fondo al vicolo  è affollatissimo di marinai  prova a chiedere a uno che ore sono  e ti risponderà "non l'ho saputo mai".  Le cartoline dell'impiccagione  sono in vendita a cento lire l'una  il commissario cieco dietro la stazione  per un indizio ti legge la sfortuna  e le forze dell'ordine irrequiete  cercano qualcosa che non va  mentre io e la mia signora ci affacciamo stasera su via della Povertà. Signorile sembra così facile  ogni volta che sorride ti cattura  ricorda proprio Bette Davis  con le mani appoggiate alla cintura.  Arriva Lombardi trafelato  e le grida "la sinistra sei tu!"  ma qualcuno gli dice di andar via  perché ormai non esiste piu' e l'unico suono che rimane  quando l'ambulanza se ne va  è Signorile che spazza la strada  in via della Povertà. Mentre l'alba sta uccidendo la luna  e le stelle si son quasi nascoste  la signora che legge la fortuna  se n'è andata in compagnia dell'oste.  Ad eccezione di Abele e di Caino  tutti quanti sono andati a far l'amore  aspettando che venga la pioggia  ad annacquare la gioia ed il dolore  e il Cardinal Marcinkus sta affilando la sua pietà  se ne andrà a far la questua stasera  in via della Povertà. Al Quirinale sono disperati  Sandro Pertini è diventato vecchio  e Andreatta piange sconcertato  vedendo Craxi che ride nello specchio.  Sofia è dietro la finestra  tutti quanti le hanno detto che è bella  non ha ancora 53 anni  e mai nessuno l'ha chiamata zitella  la sua fuga sarà molto romantica  trasformandosi in oro se ne andrà  si è stufata di andare avanti e indietro in via della Povertà. Mongolfini travestito da pallone  ha nascosto i suoi appunti in un baule  è passato di qui un'ora fa  diretto verso l'ultima Thule\,  sembrava così timido e impaurito  quando ha chiesto di fermarsi un po' qui  ma poi ha cominciato a fumare  e a recitare l'A B C  ed a vederlo tu non lo diresti mai  ma era famoso qualche tempo fa  per suonare il violino elettrico  in via della Povertà. Ci si prepara per la grande festa  c'è qualcuno che comincia ad aver sete  Woityla ha gettato la ghiara si è travestito in abiti da prete  sta ingozzando a viva forza Berlinguer per punirlo della sua frugalità lo ucciderà parlandogli d'amore  dopo averlo avvelenato di pietà  e mentre Woityla grida  4 suore si son spogliate già  Berlinguer sta per essere violentato  in via della Povertà. E bravo Carboni mattacchione  il paese sta affondando nella merda e gli Anarchici tutti annegati e il capitano grida "ce ne stanno ancora"\,  e Agnelli e Indro Montanelli  fanno a pugni nella torre di comando  i suonatori di calipso ridono di loro  mentre il cielo si sta allontanando  e affacciati alle loro finestre nel mare  tutti pescano garofani e lillà  e nessuno deve più preoccuparsi  di via della Povertà. Il tuo articolo l'ho letto proprio ieri  ci hai messo dentro tutto quel che sai ma non essere ridicolo  non chiedermi "come stai"\,  questa gente di cui mi vai parlando  è quasi gente come tutti noi  non mi sembra che siano mostri  e né tanto meno eroi  e non mandarmi altre bozze da correggere nessuno ti risponderà  se non provi a spedirmi i tuoi articoli da via della Povertà.  Attraverso il gioco del rovescio della canzone di De André ha luogo la demitizzazione e la demistificazione. Via della Povertà ne offre un illuminato esempio. Marinai che affollano un salone di bellezza\, un commissario cieco che predice la sfortuna\, una Cenerentola non più ritrosa e fuggitiva ma spavalda ed energica come Bette Davis\, un Romeo che viene scacciato mentre fa la sua dichiarazione d'amore\, il Buon Samaritano che affila la pietà come se fosse un'arma e la indossa come una maschera di carnevale\, Mister Hyde in lacrime vedendo la sua parte cosiddetta sana "che ride nello specchio"\, un'Ofelia che si scopre zitella\, un Albert Einstein "travestito da ubriacone"\, il fantasma dell'opera "vestito in abiti da prete"\, un Casanova che "sta per essere violentato"\, il dio del mare che si diverte a far scendere negli abissi il Titanic mentre il sole si sta alzando: sono alcuni dei personaggi di un mondo carnevalizzato\, maschere di un teatrino dell'assurdo forse\, ma rivelatori di un modo d'essere degli uomini: "è gente come tutti noi / non mi sembra che siano mostri / non mi sembra che siano eroi".

She quickly became a popular attraction. Hall left the Taft in 1940\, taking Dolly with him. In July of 1941 he grew weary of leading a band and turned over his orchestra to Dolly\, renaming it Dolly Dawn and her Dawn Patrol. Dolly was successful leading the group\, but the stress of the job soon got to her. Her singing career was doing quite well\, and she found it easier to book herself solo than with the band. In March of 1942 she gave up the orchestra. COL channel name VAL warholsoup100	0

And Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot Fighting in the captain's tower While calypso singers laugh at them And fishermen hold flowers Between the windows of the sea Where lovely mermaids flow And nobody has to think too much About Desolation Row  Yes\, I received your letter yesterday (About the time the doorknob broke) When you asked how I was doing Was that some kind of joke?

Draper (25 enero 1923 hasta 28 marzo 2003)\,  conocido profesionalmente como Rusty Draper \, era un cantante americano de Pop que logró su mayor éxito en la década de 1950.  Nacido en Kirksville\, Missouri (el apodo de "Rusty" era por su pelo rojo) comenzó a actuar en el programa de radio de su tío en Tulsa \, Oklahoma a mediados de la década de 1930. Draper pasó a trabajar en las estaciones de radio en Des Moines \, Iowa  (veces tomando el lugar del locutor deportivo Ronald Reagan) \, y en Illinois antes de instalarse en California . Allí comenzó a cantar en  clubes \, convirtiéndose en el cantante oficial del casino de San Francisco . A principios de la década de 1950 había empezado a aparecer en programas de televisión nacionales\, incluyendo The Ed Sullivan Show (CBS) y Ozark Jubilee (ABC).  En 1952\, Draper firmó con Mercury Records y lanzó su primera grabación  \, "How Could You (ojos azules)". Al año siguiente\, después de una gira nacional de clubes\, su versión de  Jim Lowe's "Gambler's Guitar" 's llegó al N º 6 en las listas de éxitos de todo el paçis\, y vendió un millón de copias\, consiguiendo  un disco de oro.  Tras una serie de éxitos menores\, volvió a lo más alto en 1955 con "Seventeen" (N º 18)\, "El Shifting\, Whispering Sands" (N º 3) y "Are You Satisfied?" (No. 11)\, convirtiéndose en uno de los cantantes  de pop  con más éxito de la época.  En 1962\, firmó con con Monument Records \, con cada vez menos éxito en las listas ya que su estilo se fue quedando anticuado. Sin embargo\, él continuó teniendo éxitos menores durante la década de 1960.

COL title VAL My Elusive Dreams COL performer VAL Skeeter Davis & Bobby Bare	COL video title VAL Robert Palmer - Don't Explain (Billie Holiday / Arthur Herzog's Cover) [Audio HQ] COL description VAL "Don't Explain" beautiful cover made it by Robert Palmer that you can find in his homonymous Lp of 1990. This song is surely one of the most amazing that he made on this album. Good Listening.  1990's  Don't  Explain  lp finds Robert Palmer in an ambitious  mood\, attempting  to highlight  both  his love of world  music and jazz standards  on an album  featuring  trademark  hard  rock. Essentially\, this 18  song collection comes across like three separate mini albums\, lacking a sense of cohesiveness when played as a whole\, a jarring juxtoposition of divergent musical styles instead of one record. However\, there are plenty of gems among the 18 tracks featured. Palmer showcases his love for African influenced melodies with the uptempo "Housework"\, complete with clever humorous lyrics\, and does a credible reggae version of Bob Dylan's "I'll Be Your Babt Tonight" with help from UB40 believe it or not. Actually\, that song was a major hit single in the UK!! The first third of the album is dominated by the rock material\, especially on the fast paced guitar driven metal songs "You're Mother Should Have Told You" and "Can't Get Enough Of A Good Thing". The highlight  is a rock  power ballad version of Otis Redding's "Dreams To Remember" where Palmer has to flex some vocal muscle and invoke some soul not present in the faster paced rock  songs. "You're Amazing" is a pleasant rocker (and a Top 40 US Hit Single)\, milder than the previous mentioned songs and similair to the singer's 1988 hit "Simply Irresistible"\, although not as good. The last third of this set sees the singer in full romance mode\, alternating between inspired original compositions such as "Aeroplane" and "Not A Word" and Palmer's own take of classic bits such as "You're So Desirable". The first two feature excellent string arrangements and show Palmer capable of conveying emotion vocally without being over the top while the latter plays to his vocal strengths with a more happy lyric and upbeat tempo. The title track is a Bille Holiday standard where Palmer's subtle\, understated vocals strongly convey the emotions of longing and pain expressed in the lyrics. In between it all is a unique medley of 2 Marvin Gaye hits\, "Mercy Mercy Me" and "I Want You"\, where the singer literally creates a whole new song\, using the pain and anguish over a world going bad from Gaye's powerful environmental ode as the bridge into a lyrical pleading for a chance at romance from Gaye's second number. Sticking with an arrangement culled largely from the first song\, the lyrics provide near perfect segue and Palmer raises the bar with some of his most powerful vocalizing in the song's second half. It's little wonder this song was a major hit single in both the US and UK\, arguably the best known song in this collection. Overall\, there are a good 12-14 songs in this set that would make a really good Robert Palmer record\, the problem here isn't that there isn't enough\, it's that there is a bit too much. Still a good buy\, with a lot of interesting material alongside some enjoyable guitar driven rock songs. In fact\, Palmer recruits Steve Stevens from Billy Idol's band to assist on some of the more edgy material\, an excellent choice. Robert Palmer fans will definately enjoy.

Join our Youtube: https://goo.gl/8AOGaN Join our Facebook: http://goo.gl/5oL723 George Gershwin (September 26\, 1898 -- July 11\, 1937) was an American composer and pianist. Gershwin's compositions spanned both popular and classical genres\, and his most popular melodies are widely known. Among his best known works are the orchestral compositions Rhapsody in Blue (1924) and An American in Paris (1928)\, as well as the opera Porgy and Bess (1935). Gershwin studied piano under Charles Hambitzer and composition with Rubin Goldmark and Henry Cowell. He began his career as a song plugger\, but soon started composing Broadway theatre works with his brother Ira Gershwin and Buddy DeSylva. He moved to Paris to study with Nadia Boulanger\, where he began to compose An American in Paris. After returning to New York City\, he wrote Porgy and Bess with Ira and the author DuBose Heyward. Initially a commercial failure\, Porgy and Bess is now considered one of the most important American operas of the twentieth century. Gershwin moved to Hollywood and composed numerous film scores until his death in 1937 from a brain tumor. Gershwin's compositions have been adapted for use in many films and for television\, and several became jazz standards recorded in many variations. Countless celebrated singers and musicians have covered his songs.

COL title VAL Ac-Cen-Tchu-Ate the Positive COL performer VAL Ella Fitzgerald	COL video title VAL Billy Eckstine -- Get Out of Town COL description VAL Billy Eckstine (Pittsburgh\, 8 de julio de 1914 - Pittsburgh\, 8 de marzo de 1993) fue un cantante estadounidense de jazz y música pop. Poseedor de una voz de barítono\, fue durante los años cuarenta una figura carismática de la música popular negra\, al liderar una de las primeras big band de bop y convertirse en el primer cantante negro de baladas románticas (fue llamado el Sinatra negro). Con el paso de los años\, su influencia ha sido considerable en el ámbito del soul y el rhythm and blues.  Eckstine comenzó a cantar a los nueve años y participó en numerosos espectáculos para aficionados. Aunque su vocación había sido la de jugador de fútbol americano\, una grave lesión lo recondujo hacia el mundo de la música. Tras diversos trabajos al oeste de Chicago a finales de los años treinta\, Eckstine fue invitado por Earl Hines para unirse a su Grand Terrace Orchestra en 1939.  Aunque sus primeros éxitos fueron canciones triviales como "Jelly\, Jelly" y "The Jitney Man"\, grabó también varios estándares como "Stormy Monday". Hacia 1943\, se acompañaba de estrellas como Dizzy Gillespie\, Charlie Parker y Sarah Vaughan. Tras formar su propia banda ese año\, contrató a los tres y gradualmente se hizo con más figuras modernas y con futuras estrellas: Wardell Gray\, Dexter Gordon\, Miles Davis\, Kenny Dorham\, Fats Navarro y Art Blakey\, así como con arreglistas como Tadd Dameron y Gil Fuller. La Billy Eckstine Orchestra fue la primera big band bop\, y su líder reflejaba las innovaciones bop adaptando sus armonías vocales a las baladas normales. A pesar del matiz moderno del grupo\, Eckstine encabezó las listas frecuentemente a mediados de los cuarenta\, con temas como "A Cottage for Sale" y "Prisoner of Love". En las giras por Europa y América\, el cantante tocaba también la trompeta\, el trombón de válvulas y la guitarra.  Forzado a disolver la orquesta en 1947 tras haber formado la suya propia Gillespie\, Eckstine realizó una transición hacia un estilo más baladístico y con arreglos de cuerda. Grabó más de una docena de éxitos a finales de los cuarenta\, entre lo que se incluyen "My Foolish Heart" y "I Apologize". Se hizo popular en Gran Bretaña\, obteniendo un gran éxito durante los cincuenta con temas como "No One But You" y "Gigi"\, así como con sus dúos con Sarah Vaughan. Eckstine regresaría a sus raíces jazzísticas ocasionalmente\, grabando con Vaughan\, Count Basie y Quincy Jones\, y grabando un LP en directo\, No Cover\, No Minimum\, en el que interpretaba algunos solos de trompeta. Grabó varios discos para Mercury y Roulette a comienzos de los sesenta y publicó en Motown algunos discos de estándares a mediados de esa década. Tras grabar muy espaciadamente en los setenta\, Eckstine hizo su última grabación (Billy Eckstine Sings with Benny Carter) en 1986. Murió por un ataque al corazón en 1993.

She quickly became a popular attraction. Hall left the Taft in 1940\, taking Dolly with him. In July of 1941 he grew weary of leading a band and turned over his orchestra to Dolly\, renaming it Dolly Dawn and her Dawn Patrol. Dolly was successful leading the group\, but the stress of the job soon got to her. Her singing career was doing quite well\, and she found it easier to book herself solo than with the band. In March of 1942 she gave up the orchestra. COL channel name VAL warholsoup100	0

And Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot Fighting in the captain's tower While calypso singers laugh at them And fishermen hold flowers Between the windows of the sea Where lovely mermaids flow And nobody has to think too much About Desolation Row  Yes\, I received your letter yesterday (About the time the doorknob broke) When you asked how I was doing Was that some kind of joke? All these people that you mention Yes\, I know them\, they're quite lame I had to rearrange their faces And give them all another name Right now I can't read too good Don't send me no more letters\, no Not unless you mail them From Desolation Row COL channel name VAL jokerman02	1

Welle: Erdball -- Ganz In Weiß  ------------------------  "Walk on the Wild Side" is a Lou Reed song from his 1972 second solo album Transformer. It was produced by David Bowie. The song received wide radio coverage\, despite its touching on taboo topics such as transsexuality\, drugs\, male prostitutes and oral sex and the term "colored" to refer to African Americans. In the United States\, RCA released an edited version of song as a single which eliminated the song's reference to oral sex.  It is usually regarded as Reed's best-known solo work. The song reached #16 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100\, and #10 in the UK. In 2003\, the song was ranked #221 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.  Covers  This song was covered by Company B\, on their album "Jam on Me." In February 1990\, two club/hiphop versions charted simultaneously in the UK - Jamie J. Morgan's cover produced by Richard Mazda reached #27\, whilst Beat System got to #63. In 1985\, 79-year old veteran German actress Gerty Molzen recorded her own version of the song\, cleaning up some of the lyrics in the process. She performed it on the David Letterman show in the US and on Gay Byrne's Late Late Show in Ireland. Echo & the Bunnymen usually merge this in concert with Nothing Lasts Forever. A 2005 song by artist RX featured George W. Bush "singing" a mixture of John Lennon's "Imagine" and the chorus from "Walk on the Wild Side". Irish/Australian comedian Jimeoin covered the song in 1993 on his music/comedy CD\, Goin' Off. The song featured the line "You should have seen them go go go\, I said G-O-G-G-O\, take a walk on the wildside" as a reference to the popular Yellow Pages ad on TV at the time. The Strokes and Robbie Williams played the full song or a snippet during their last tours. The band Sponge have been known to break into the song in the middle of playing their hit "Have You Seen Mary?" in live performances. The Rentals also play it live before transitioning into their hit "Friends of P". Train sings this song for the Bay Area's local station KFOG\, on a CD called Live From The Archives: Vol. 11\, as a part of the KFOG Kaboom Medley. A short part of the song was often used by Bono during performances of Bad in the mid eighties. Most notably performed at Live Aid in London. At a charity event\, Lou Reed played this song with comedians Conan O'Brien\, Jimmy Fallon\, Adam Sandler\, and Jack Black. Each person took on one verse of the song. Vanessa Paradis covered the song in her album Variations sur le même t'aime. Jesse Malin covered it on On Your Sleeve\, a cover album released in 2008. Young@Heart\, an entertainment group created by and for the elderly\, composed of people at least 70 years of age\, perform this song in concert. Moby includes the song in his concerts. During Exit Festival 2009\, he referred to it as "his favourite song about New York." Editors covered this song on 2007. Cover can be found on album Rhythms del Mundo Classics. Australian band Yves Klein Blue covered the song on the radio segment 'Like a Version' on Triple J in 2010 Trumpeter Rick Braun covered the song from 2005 album "Yours Truly." The German group Tok Tok Tok covers this song in their album "I wish" in 2005. The French group Pink Turtle gives this song a Jazz Age twist in their album "Reprise! When jazz meets pop #3" (2007).  Media Appearances  In a scene from the film Hedwig and the Angry Inch Hedwig starts singing it while in an oven. This song is usually the opening to Danny Masterson's LA radio show\, "Feel My Heat". Natalie Portman sings the line "And the colored girls go Doo\, doo\, doo\, doo\, doo\, doo\, doo\, doo" in the film Beautiful Girls. In the television show Medium\, the episode "Lady Killer" featured the tune of "Walk on the Wild side" (with no lyrics) during Patricia Arquette's character's dreams about a woman seducing men\, and perhaps gave a clue to who the actual killer was. The bassline of this song is used in the Gatorade G2 commercial. In the movie Guess Who this song is playing on the radio while Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher are driving in the car. In the film The Salton Sea an old man with a tracheotomy sings the song on a karaoke machine in a bar. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

COL title VAL Call Me the Breeze COL performer VAL J.J. Cale	COL video title VAL George Barnes -- Adios COL description VAL George Barnes era uno de los guitarristas más prolíficos y versátiles de los años cincuenta y sesenta. Aunque\, básicamente era un hombre de jazz\, era un maestro de todos los estilos: blues\, country\, folk\, pop\, R & R\, R & B. Fue uno de los primeros en grabar con la guitarra eléctrica y Chet Atkins\, Les Paul y Charlie Christian le han citado como una fuente de inspiración principal.  A la edad de 14 años\, Barnes ya era un músico profesional y  había formado su propio cuarteto George Barnes. Dos años más tarde grabó sus primeros discos consu propio nombre: "I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles" and "I Can't Believe That You're In Love With Me" para el sello Okeh. En 1938 estaba trabajando para la NBC\, como director de orquesta\, guitarrista y arreglista. Tras su paso por el ejército durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial\, Barnes volvió a su trabajo de estudio y grabó transcripciones de radio con su octeto inusual.  En 1951 se trasladó de Chicago a Nueva York\, donde de inmediato consiguió un contrato con Decca para grabar sus propios álbumes. George también se reunió con Carl Kress en 1951\, el comienzo de una amistad que iba a dar lugar a una  formación aclamada por la crítica. Recorrieron el mundo juntos e hicieron algunas de las mejores grabaciones de dúos de guitarra de la historia.  En este tiempo\, George tenía  la Guild Guitar Company dedicada a construir una guitarra única bajo sus especificaciones. Tras la muerte de Kress en 1965\, la  próxima pareja de George iba a ser Bucky Pizzarelli. Como músico de estudio\, Barnes ha trabajado con todos\, desde Louis Armstrong a Bob Dylan.  iTunes: http://itunes.apple.com/es/album/guitar-galaxies/id476374761  Síguenos en: Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/vintagem.es Spotify: http://open.spotify.com/user/vintagemusic Web: http://www.vintagemusic.es BoutiqAlia: http://boutiqalia.com/store/vintage/ (compra física de CD) Compra nuestros Cd's en formato físico en estas plataformas: Ebay:  http://stores.ebay.com/VintageMusicFm BoutiqAlia: www.boutiqalia-vintagemusic.com Síguenos en: Spotify: https://goo.gl/raouHQ Facebook: https://goo.gl/L92BHL Instagram: https://goo.gl/3oYDGH Web: http://www.vintagemusic.es   Compra nuestros Cd's en formato físico en estas plataformas: Ebay:  http://stores.ebay.com/VintageMusicFm BoutiqAlia: www.boutiqalia-vintagemusic.com Discogs: https://www.discogs.com/es/seller/vintagemusicfm/profile COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm	0

COL title VAL Naima COL performer VAL Nicola Stilo  Toninho Horta	COL video title VAL Bobby Scott  "Nature Boy"      (1990) COL description VAL In 1941\, a 33 year old George McGrew arrived in Los Angeles and began playing piano in the Eutropheon\, a small health food store and raw food restaurant on Laurel Canyon Boulevard. The cafe was owned by John and Vera Richter\, German immigrants who followed a Naturmensch and Lebensreform philosophy influenced by the Wandervogel movement in Germany.Their followers\, known as "Nature Boys"\, wore long hair and beards and ate only raw fruits and vegetables. McGrew adopted the philosophy and chose the name "eden ahbez"\, writing and spelling his name with lower-case letters. It was there while living in a cave near Palm Springs\, ahbez wrote "Nature Boy". Partly autobiographical\, the song was a tribute to his mentor Bill Pester\, who had originally introduced him to Naturmensch and Lebensreform.  In 1947\, at the prompting of Cowboy Jack Patton and Johnny Mercer\, ahbez approached Nat King Cole's manager backstage at the Lincoln Theater in Los Angeles\, handed him a tattered copy of "Nature Boy"\, and asked him to show it to Cole. However his pleas were ignored and a disappointed ahbez left the sheet music of "Nature Boy" with Cole's valet\, Otis Pollard. From him Cole came to know of the song and after reading it\, the singer loved it and began playing "Nature Boy" for live audiences to much acclaim. Irving Berlin\, who was present in the crowd\, had initially offered to buy the track from Cole. But he decided to record the track for himself and needed to get permission from ahbez before releasing it as a single. After ahbez was discovered living under the Hollywood Sign\, Cole got his permission and recorded the song COL channel name VAL nyronut	0

Draper (25 enero 1923 hasta 28 marzo 2003)\,  conocido profesionalmente como Rusty Draper \, era un cantante americano de Pop que logró su mayor éxito en la década de 1950.  Nacido en Kirksville\, Missouri (el apodo de "Rusty" era por su pelo rojo) comenzó a actuar en el programa de radio de su tío en Tulsa \, Oklahoma a mediados de la década de 1930. Draper pasó a trabajar en las estaciones de radio en Des Moines \, Iowa  (veces tomando el lugar del locutor deportivo Ronald Reagan) \, y en Illinois antes de instalarse en California . Allí comenzó a cantar en  clubes \, convirtiéndose en el cantante oficial del casino de San Francisco . A principios de la década de 1950 había empezado a aparecer en programas de televisión nacionales\, incluyendo The Ed Sullivan Show (CBS) y Ozark Jubilee (ABC).  En 1952\, Draper firmó con Mercury Records y lanzó su primera grabación  \, "How Could You (ojos azules)". Al año siguiente\, después de una gira nacional de clubes\, su versión de  Jim Lowe's "Gambler's Guitar" 's llegó al N º 6 en las listas de éxitos de todo el paçis\, y vendió un millón de copias\, consiguiendo  un disco de oro.  Tras una serie de éxitos menores\, volvió a lo más alto en 1955 con "Seventeen" (N º 18)\, "El Shifting\, Whispering Sands" (N º 3) y "Are You Satisfied?" (No. 11)\, convirtiéndose en uno de los cantantes  de pop  con más éxito de la época.  En 1962\, firmó con con Monument Records \, con cada vez menos éxito en las listas ya que su estilo se fue quedando anticuado. Sin embargo\, él continuó teniendo éxitos menores durante la década de 1960.  Apareció en musicales de teatro y en la televisión\,  Draper murió de neumonía \, en Bellevue\, Washington \, a la edad de 80 años.

COL title VAL Shaking the Blues Away COL performer VAL Doris Day	COL video title VAL SALTY HOLMES - Blue Eyes Cryin' in the Rain.wmv COL description VAL Recorded by Salty in the 40's\, it is now an ironic tribute to the love of his life\, Mattie O'Neil aka Jean Chapel. Their marriage ended in 1957\, but his love for her never did. It was an unusually amicable ending caused by his drinking problem and the seperate success she began to have when she went into rock & roll as Jean Chapel. Sadly he was left in the wings.   He passed away on Jan.1\, 1970\, and she passed on Aug. 12\, 1995. Both had remarried\, but the bond had never been truly broken between them\, mainly because of their daughter Lana.  Lana and her Mom\, whom he always called Mattie\, drank a private toast together to him every New Year's Eve after his death. New Year's Eve was his favorite and most sentimental occassion...and strangely enough\, he lived through New Year's Eve of 1969 in the hospital to die in the early hours of New Year's Day\, 1970.  Both Salty and Matiie had the same birthday of Mar. 6th..though different years. They had a truly psychic connection.  Maybe they're jamming again on that big stage in the sky..... Lana would surely like to think so\, for she'd like to get back into the act again someday.... COL channel name VAL SALTYHOLMES	0

COL title VAL The Dark End of the Street COL performer VAL Veronica Klaus	COL video title VAL Billy Eckstine -- Get Out of Town COL description VAL Billy Eckstine (Pittsburgh\, 8 de julio de 1914 - Pittsburgh\, 8 de marzo de 1993) fue un cantante estadounidense de jazz y música pop. Poseedor de una voz de barítono\, fue durante los años cuarenta una figura carismática de la música popular negra\, al liderar una de las primeras big band de bop y convertirse en el primer cantante negro de baladas románticas (fue llamado el Sinatra negro). Con el paso de los años\, su influencia ha sido considerable en el ámbito del soul y el rhythm and blues.  Eckstine comenzó a cantar a los nueve años y participó en numerosos espectáculos para aficionados. Aunque su vocación había sido la de jugador de fútbol americano\, una grave lesión lo recondujo hacia el mundo de la música. Tras diversos trabajos al oeste de Chicago a finales de los años treinta\, Eckstine fue invitado por Earl Hines para unirse a su Grand Terrace Orchestra en 1939.  Aunque sus primeros éxitos fueron canciones triviales como "Jelly\, Jelly" y "The Jitney Man"\, grabó también varios estándares como "Stormy Monday". Hacia 1943\, se acompañaba de estrellas como Dizzy Gillespie\, Charlie Parker y Sarah Vaughan. Tras formar su propia banda ese año\, contrató a los tres y gradualmente se hizo con más figuras modernas y con futuras estrellas: Wardell Gray\, Dexter Gordon\, Miles Davis\, Kenny Dorham\, Fats Navarro y Art Blakey\, así como con arreglistas como Tadd Dameron y Gil Fuller. La Billy Eckstine Orchestra fue la primera big band bop\, y su líder reflejaba las innovaciones bop adaptando sus armonías vocales a las baladas normales. A pesar del matiz moderno del grupo\, Eckstine encabezó las listas frecuentemente a mediados de los cuarenta\, con temas como "A Cottage for Sale" y "Prisoner of Love". En las giras por Europa y América\, el cantante tocaba también la trompeta\, el trombón de válvulas y la guitarra.  Forzado a disolver la orquesta en 1947 tras haber formado la suya propia Gillespie\, Eckstine realizó una transición hacia un estilo más baladístico y con arreglos de cuerda. Grabó más de una docena de éxitos a finales de los cuarenta\, entre lo que se incluyen "My Foolish Heart" y "I Apologize". Se hizo popular en Gran Bretaña\, obteniendo un gran éxito durante los cincuenta con temas como "No One But You" y "Gigi"\, así como con sus dúos con Sarah Vaughan. Eckstine regresaría a sus raíces jazzísticas ocasionalmente\, grabando con Vaughan\, Count Basie y Quincy Jones\, y grabando un LP en directo\, No Cover\, No Minimum\, en el que interpretaba algunos solos de trompeta. Grabó varios discos para Mercury y Roulette a comienzos de los sesenta y publicó en Motown algunos discos de estándares a mediados de esa década. Tras grabar muy espaciadamente en los setenta\, Eckstine hizo su última grabación (Billy Eckstine Sings with Benny Carter) en 1986. Murió por un ataque al corazón en 1993.

Ashby extended the popularization of jazz harp past a novelty\, showing how the instrument can be utilized seamlessly as much a bebop instrument as the saxophone. Her albums were of the jazz genre\, but often moved into R&B\, world and other musics\, especially on her 1970 album The Rubaiyat of Dorothy Ashby\, where she demonstrates her talents on another instrument\, the Japanese koto\, successfully integrating it into jazz.

The New York Voices was formed through a college alumni group and released their first\, self-titled album in 1989 and won a Grammy award for their 1996 collaboration with the Basie band\, Count Basie Orchestra with New York Voices Live at Manchester Craftsmen's Guild. Initially a sextet the NYV have\, through numerous member changes\, become a quintet and now a quartet. Besides their performances they give jazz clinics at schools and universities. They have to date released seven albums\, all blends of classical\, pop\, R&B\, Brazilian and jazz. This is primarily a pop-oriented date with the exception of the opening "All Blues" and "Lady Be Good". The latter is meant as a tribute to Ella Fitzgerald since it quotes from her famous scat solo. Seven of the 11 selections are group originals. Also included are Bill Wither's "Ain't No Sunshine" and James Taylor's "Traffic Jam". Not too many copies of this album around now as it's been out of print for a while. COL channel name VAL Damir Aleksic	0

Lyrics: Hello\, darkness\, my old friend I've come to talk with you again Because a vision softly creeping Left its seeds while I was sleeping  And the vision that was planted in my brain Still remains Within the sound of silence  In restless dreams I walked alone Narrow streets of cobblestone 'Neath the halo of a street lamp I turned my collar to the cold and damp  When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light That split the night And touched the sound of silence  And in the naked light I saw Ten thousand people\, maybe more People talking without speaking People hearing without listening  People writing songs that voices never share And no one dare Disturb the sound of silence  "Fools\," said I\, ""You do not know Silence\, like a cancer\, grows Hear my words that I might teach you Take my arms that I might reach you""  But my words like silent raindrops fell And echoed in the wells of silence  And the people bowed and prayed To the neon god they made And the sign flashed out its warning In the words that it was forming  And the sign said "The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls And tenement halls And whispered in the sound Of silence"  #OfficialMusicVideo #Disturbed #SoundOfSilence #WeAreWarnerRecords COL channel name VAL Disturbed	0

COL title VAL A Cottage for Sale COL performer VAL Maxine Sullivan	COL video title VAL ♥ "Red Roses for a Blue Lady" - The Lettermen COL description VAL Song: Red Roses for a Blue Lady Singers: The Lettermen  The making of this video: This music video is a compilation of photos that I have previously taken (except the wedding gown photo).  The lovely lady wearing very deep dark blue dress who became the "circumstantial" or "incidental" subject of this video just happened to be walking towards my direction when I was trying to take the photo of the Shibuya Station (渋谷駅) Exit towards the famous Shibuya Hachiko (忠犬 ハチ公).  (See Wikipedia and type in "Hachiko" for this story.)  The HMV Music Store is a "shop till you drop" music store near Shibuya JR train & the Metro subway station in Tokyo.  It was my YT friend (60otaku3) who gave me the info where to find it in the Tokyo maze.   The floribunda red roses were from my garden.  The San-ai flower shop is in the prime corner spot of Ginza\, a very high class shopping district of downtown Tokyo. It was the blue roses of this flower shop that gave me the idea to make this video of this Lettermen song. Luckily this flower shop also had the white orchids on display.  Except for the beat and transitions\, my videos usually have no direct relation to the lyrics of the song.  This music video however has become a true composition and I like the outcome.  ***************************************  And to the beautiful Lady at Shibuya Station (渋谷駅): Thank you for wearing the right color and being at the right spot at the perfect time when I clicked the camera shutter.  That photo was taken at 1:34 p.m. on July 3\, 2008.  - COL channel name VAL 65Seasons	0

"I Only Have Eyes for You" is a popular romantic love song by composer Harry Warren and lyricist Al Dubin\, written in 1934. The song is a jazz standard\, and has been covered by thousands of musicians. -Lyrics - Are the stars out tonight? I don't know if it's cloudy or bright 'Cause I only have eyes for you\, dear The moon may be high But I can't see a thing in the sky 'Cause I only have eyes for you. I don't know if we're in a garden Or on a crowded avenue You are here\, so am I Maybe millions of people go by But they all disappear from view And I only have eyes for you I don't know if we're in a garden Or on a crowded avenue You are here\, so am I Maybe millions of people go by But they all disappear from view And I only have eyes for you.  - Song and images belong to their respective owners - COL channel name VAL Dreamer8girl	0

Though one can still hear the formative Django Reinhardt harmonic influence in the single-string runs\, Paul's showboating style is fully formed here\, marked by humor and mind-boggling speed\, but also by a lyrical gift in ballads like "Stardust." The songs\, mostly standards and uncredited public domain material\, are all rather brief\, but that imposes a welcome discipline on the solos\, although Paul did tend to repeat certain ideas from song to song at that time. The CD box fails to name the members of the trio\, but one can surmise from the year that Paul Smith is on piano\, Cal Gooden is on rhythm guitar\, and Bob Meyer is on bass; and they make a nifty\, tight-knit foursome."

Recorded February 1964 on USA Records #102.  Great! That was the reaction to The Rivieras almost a year ago in the town of La Porte\, Indiana. It was in La Porte that the group played their first professional performance at the "Tipon Terrace Danceland".  Bill Dobslaw\, 21 years old and a native of Sawyer\, Michigan\, at the request of the group\, took over as manager and vocalist when the original singer left for the Marines. The other members of the group\, whose ages average 18 and attend high school in South Bend\, Indiana\, are Paul Dennert\, drummer-Otto Nuss\, organist-Doug Gean\, bass guitar-Jim boal\, lead guitar-and Willie Gaut\, rhythm guitar.  After their initial performance The Rivieras received many requests for "California Sun"\, a song which they recorded in Chicago at the prompting of many fans. The record soon found its way on the local charts in Michigan and Indiana and was brought to the attention of Art Roberts\, DJ at WLS Radio in Chicago. Thanks to the efforts of that station and many others\, the song went on to become an international hit. The overnight success of The Rivieras has left them very appreciative of the many fans who have helped to make them the outstanding new group of 1964. COL channel name VAL leadsquirter	1

COL title VAL My Blue Heaven COL performer VAL Norah Jones	COL video title VAL Square Set - To love somebody COL description VAL South African band formed in March 1966 (as per Derek Marks himself) by:  1. Nol Klinkhamer (keyboards) 2. Neville Whitmill (vocals) 3. Keith Moffat (drums) 4. Derek Marks (bass)  In August 1966\, this line-up recorded the 7” single “Silence Is Golden”\, as well as the album with the same title. Ian Martin was the recording sound engineer and Mike Noble was in a band called “The Hi Five” with Neville Whitmill long before The Square Set was formed\, but neither Ian or Mike were ever members of The Square Set\, as certain sources suggest.  In 1967 Keith was replaced by Don Robertson on drums\, and three months later Malcolm Postlethwaite in turn replaced Don. Don recorded “Carol Corina” with The Square Set in 1967\, while Malcolm recorded the follow-up Album “Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever' early in 1968. The remaining members remained the same throughout the years\, up until The Square Set split in August 1968.  When “That's What I Want” suddenly became popular 4 years later\, Nol and Neville reformed the band (late 1971)\, but Derek Marks didn't want to re-join\, therefore they employed Johnny Boshoff and Tony Moore to complete the third album “Those Many Feelings”. Mike Faure on sax joined the band on stage for about 3 months in 1968\, while Mercia Love was in the band from July 1967 to February 1968.  The Square Set had two South African Top 20 hits: 1. Carol Corina – 1967\, #15\, 5 weeks 2. Silence is golden – 1967\, #3\, 13 weeks  Neville Whitmiil also had two South African Top 20 hits as a solo artist: 1. Get me some help – 1971\, #2\, 18 weeks 2. Harmony – 1973\, #18\, 3 weeks  This song is off the album "Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever"\, released in 1968. It's a cover of a Bee Gees song from 1967.

COL title VAL Bag's Groove COL performer VAL Ron Carter and Jim Hall	COL video title VAL Ain' t no sunshine      New York Voices COL description VAL If you're unfamiliar with this group from the "Big Apple" let me introduce you. The New York Voices was formed through a college alumni group and released their first\, self-titled album in 1989 and won a Grammy award for their 1996 collaboration with the Basie band\, Count Basie Orchestra with New York Voices Live at Manchester Craftsmen's Guild. Initially a sextet the NYV have\, through numerous member changes\, become a quintet and now a quartet. Besides their performances they give jazz clinics at schools and universities. They have to date released seven albums\, all blends of classical\, pop\, R&B\, Brazilian and jazz. This is primarily a pop-oriented date with the exception of the opening "All Blues" and "Lady Be Good". The latter is meant as a tribute to Ella Fitzgerald since it quotes from her famous scat solo. Seven of the 11 selections are group originals. Also included are Bill Wither's "Ain't No Sunshine" and James Taylor's "Traffic Jam". Not too many copies of this album around now as it's been out of print for a while. COL channel name VAL Damir Aleksic	0

COL title VAL Moritat von Mackie Messer COL performer VAL Kurt Gerron	COL video title VAL Rosemary Clooney & Perez Prado - Mack The Knife (VintageMusic.es) COL description VAL Rosemary Clooney\, disfrutó durante la década de los cincuenta de una extraordinaria fama con canciones absolutamente mediocres. De la mano de Mitch Miller\, director artístico de la casa Columbia\, aplicó el inexorable principio de que\, cuantos peores eran los arreglos y las letras de los temas\, mas beneficio económico para la discográfica. onsiguió grabar un par de duets con Frank Sinatra en 1950 y a partir de ahí le sobrevino la fama y la popularidad. Tuvo su propio show televisivo e incluso Hollywood llamó a su puerta para que participara junto a Bing Crosby y Danny Kaye en algunas comedias musicales siendo la mas celebre el film de Michael Curtiz\, "White Christmas".No obstante lo dicho\, Rosemary Clooney\, se acercó tardíamente al jazz y grabó una par de magníficos álbumes para Columbia: "The Best Of Hollywood" con la orquesta del trompetista\, Harry James\, y "Blue Rose"\, su obra mas conseguida y un disco que pudo ser memorable con la orquesta de Duke Ellington. Es la tía sanguínea del actual actor George Clooney.  Dámaso Pérez Prado (Matanzas\, Cuba\, 11 de diciembre de 1916 - Ciudad de México\, 14 de septiembre de 1989)\, el "Rey del Mambo"\, fue un músico\, compositor y arreglista cubano.Dámaso Pérez Prado es mayormente conocido por sus aportes al género del mambo\, que tiene sus orígenes en el danzón cubano y daría pauta al surgimiento y desarrollo del chachachá.Pasado el clímax del mambo\, es llamativo que Dámaso Pérez Prado\, una vez compuesta su pieza musical "Patricia" y obtenido su éxito correspondiente\, la grabase muchas veces y con diferentes arreglos\, actitud que parece demostrar que tuvo por dicha pieza una especial predilección. Entre sus composiciones más conocidas se encuentran Qué rico el mambo y Mambo Nº 5\, ésta última después lanzada en una nueva versión en 1999 por el cantante alemán Lou Bega.

H. Auden ▼▼▼  GUNTER NORIS Gunter Noris was a famous German pianist\, composer\, arranger and bandleader. Noris studied music and composition in Wurzburg and joined the RIAS Tanzorchester in 1961 as pianist and assistant conductor. In 1966\, Hildegard Knef hired Noris as musical director for her first "Chanson Tournee". Noris left RIAS in 1967 and joined the West Deutsche Rundfunk (WDR) as bandleader\, arranger and pianist.  Noris erected the Big Band of the Bundeswehr in 1971 and performed both at the 1972 Munich Olympics and at the 1974 Football Championships with this band.  He re-arranged Herbert Rehbein's "Olympia Thema" and this title\, appropriately called "Swinging Olympia" became the tune of a famous radio program - "die Europarade".  He left the Bundeswehr in 1983 and founded his own band\, a band that soon would be very popular\, thanks to the so-called "Noris sound". His band was proclaimed "best dance orchestra in the world" in 1995 by the German dance organization ADTV (Algemeine Deutsche Tanz Verein) During his career\, which spanned nearly 40 years\, he appeared "live in concert" on more than 2500 occasions spread over 15 countries. German Bundespresident Richard von Weizsacker awarded the so called "Bundesverdienstkreuz" to Noris in 2005\, as a recognition for the fact that Noris' many charity concerts had generated millions of Euros (Deutsche Marks before 2000)  BUT NOT FOR ME "But Not for Me" is a popular song\, composed by George Gershwin\, with lyrics by Ira Gershwin. It was written for their musical Girl Crazy (1930) and introduced in the original production by Ginger Rogers. Numerous artists\, vocalists and instrumentalists alike\, have performed the song since it's initial release in 1930.  MHO A fine arrangement of Gershwin's "But Not For Me" with Noris demonstrating his superb skills as a pianist.  At the same time we can also enjoy his arranging skills - his piano playing is being accompanied by a gentle and well balanced orchestra and as such we get to hear a smooth and softly swinging version of this well known standard. This recording - from 1969 - obviously was made before the "Noris sound" was born but Noris' musicality and originality can be heard already here.  Enjoy ! COL channel name VAL Socratess2007	0

Travis Edmonson had previously been a member of the Gateway Singers. They released ten albums and toured widely before splitting in 1965\, becoming significant musicians on the folk revival circuit. Edmonson and Dashiell reportedly had frequent clashes\, and the duo separated from 1960-63. During this period Dashiell put out several records with The Kinsmen\, and Edmonson put out several solo albums. Dashiell went solo after their final breakup in 1965\, putting out a solo album in 1968. He taught late in life\, and died in 1989 as a result of a brain tumor. Edmonson toured regularly in the 1970s as a solo act.

The song was published in 1957.  The biggest hit version of the song was recorded by Perry Como in 1957\, and became a hit in early 1958. The peak position is hard to track precisely\, due to the multiple charts used in Billboard. The overall impact of the song probably fell just below the top ten. The song was also a 1958 hit in Italy\, while in the United Kingdom it spent eight weeks at number one\, becoming Como's biggest ever hit there. A much less successful UK cover version recorded by Ronnie Hilton reached #22 on the UK Singles Chart.  Amanda Lear recorded this song for her 1985 EP A L.  Synthpop duo Erasure recorded the song for their 1997 album Cowboy. Their version is featured in the Clive Barker film Lord of Illusions\, providing the background music to a magicians' convention.  Magic Moments is also the name given to a Surprise\, Surprise style show within the BBC television film Pat and Margaret. Its theme music is the song itself and as the coach carrying various members of the audience sets off at the start of the film\, they start singing it.  This song was used in the television commercial for Quality Street\, a confectionery brand in the UK in the 1980s and continues to be used each year for the brand's Christmas advertisements.  The song is also occasionally sung by Ulster Rugby fans at away matches\, particularly after 'magic moments' of play.  The Perry Como version is featured in the 1998 film\, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\, when Raoul arrives at a Vegas hotel where Dr. Gonzo is located\, briefly in Dogma (1999)\, Two Weeks Notice (2002)\, Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason (2004)\, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (2005)\, and Episode 3 of the first season of the 2012 BBC series Call the Midwife\, which is set in 1957.

COL title VAL In Bloom COL performer VAL Framing Hanley	COL video title VAL Ain' t no sunshine      New York Voices COL description VAL If you're unfamiliar with this group from the "Big Apple" let me introduce you. The New York Voices was formed through a college alumni group and released their first\, self-titled album in 1989 and won a Grammy award for their 1996 collaboration with the Basie band\, Count Basie Orchestra with New York Voices Live at Manchester Craftsmen's Guild. Initially a sextet the NYV have\, through numerous member changes\, become a quintet and now a quartet. Besides their performances they give jazz clinics at schools and universities. They have to date released seven albums\, all blends of classical\, pop\, R&B\, Brazilian and jazz. This is primarily a pop-oriented date with the exception of the opening "All Blues" and "Lady Be Good". The latter is meant as a tribute to Ella Fitzgerald since it quotes from her famous scat solo. Seven of the 11 selections are group originals. Also included are Bill Wither's "Ain't No Sunshine" and James Taylor's "Traffic Jam". Not too many copies of this album around now as it's been out of print for a while. COL channel name VAL Damir Aleksic	0

Via della povertà    (versione LIVE eseguita a Viareggio nei primi anni "80)   Il Salone di bellezza in fondo al vicolo  è affollatissimo di marinai  prova a chiedere a uno che ore sono  e ti risponderà "non l'ho saputo mai".  Le cartoline dell'impiccagione  sono in vendita a cento lire l'una  il commissario cieco dietro la stazione  per un indizio ti legge la sfortuna  e le forze dell'ordine irrequiete  cercano qualcosa che non va  mentre io e la mia signora ci affacciamo stasera su via della Povertà. Signorile sembra così facile  ogni volta che sorride ti cattura  ricorda proprio Bette Davis  con le mani appoggiate alla cintura.  Arriva Lombardi trafelato  e le grida "la sinistra sei tu!"  ma qualcuno gli dice di andar via  perché ormai non esiste piu' e l'unico suono che rimane  quando l'ambulanza se ne va  è Signorile che spazza la strada  in via della Povertà. Mentre l'alba sta uccidendo la luna  e le stelle si son quasi nascoste  la signora che legge la fortuna  se n'è andata in compagnia dell'oste.  Ad eccezione di Abele e di Caino  tutti quanti sono andati a far l'amore  aspettando che venga la pioggia  ad annacquare la gioia ed il dolore  e il Cardinal Marcinkus sta affilando la sua pietà  se ne andrà a far la questua stasera  in via della Povertà. Al Quirinale sono disperati  Sandro Pertini è diventato vecchio  e Andreatta piange sconcertato  vedendo Craxi che ride nello specchio.  Sofia è dietro la finestra  tutti quanti le hanno detto che è bella  non ha ancora 53 anni  e mai nessuno l'ha chiamata zitella  la sua fuga sarà molto romantica  trasformandosi in oro se ne andrà  si è stufata di andare avanti e indietro in via della Povertà. Mongolfini travestito da pallone  ha nascosto i suoi appunti in un baule  è passato di qui un'ora fa  diretto verso l'ultima Thule\,  sembrava così timido e impaurito  quando ha chiesto di fermarsi un po' qui  ma poi ha cominciato a fumare  e a recitare l'A B C  ed a vederlo tu non lo diresti mai  ma era famoso qualche tempo fa  per suonare il violino elettrico  in via della Povertà. Ci si prepara per la grande festa  c'è qualcuno che comincia ad aver sete  Woityla ha gettato la ghiara si è travestito in abiti da prete  sta ingozzando a viva forza Berlinguer per punirlo della sua frugalità lo ucciderà parlandogli d'amore  dopo averlo avvelenato di pietà  e mentre Woityla grida  4 suore si son spogliate già  Berlinguer sta per essere violentato  in via della Povertà. E bravo Carboni mattacchione  il paese sta affondando nella merda e gli Anarchici tutti annegati e il capitano grida "ce ne stanno ancora"\,  e Agnelli e Indro Montanelli  fanno a pugni nella torre di comando  i suonatori di calipso ridono di loro  mentre il cielo si sta allontanando  e affacciati alle loro finestre nel mare  tutti pescano garofani e lillà  e nessuno deve più preoccuparsi  di via della Povertà. Il tuo articolo l'ho letto proprio ieri  ci hai messo dentro tutto quel che sai ma non essere ridicolo  non chiedermi "come stai"\,  questa gente di cui mi vai parlando  è quasi gente come tutti noi  non mi sembra che siano mostri  e né tanto meno eroi  e non mandarmi altre bozze da correggere nessuno ti risponderà  se non provi a spedirmi i tuoi articoli da via della Povertà.  Attraverso il gioco del rovescio della canzone di De André ha luogo la demitizzazione e la demistificazione. Via della Povertà ne offre un illuminato esempio. Marinai che affollano un salone di bellezza\, un commissario cieco che predice la sfortuna\, una Cenerentola non più ritrosa e fuggitiva ma spavalda ed energica come Bette Davis\, un Romeo che viene scacciato mentre fa la sua dichiarazione d'amore\, il Buon Samaritano che affila la pietà come se fosse un'arma e la indossa come una maschera di carnevale\, Mister Hyde in lacrime vedendo la sua parte cosiddetta sana "che ride nello specchio"\, un'Ofelia che si scopre zitella\, un Albert Einstein "travestito da ubriacone"\, il fantasma dell'opera "vestito in abiti da prete"\, un Casanova che "sta per essere violentato"\, il dio del mare che si diverte a far scendere negli abissi il Titanic mentre il sole si sta alzando: sono alcuni dei personaggi di un mondo carnevalizzato\, maschere di un teatrino dell'assurdo forse\, ma rivelatori di un modo d'essere degli uomini: "è gente come tutti noi / non mi sembra che siano mostri / non mi sembra che siano eroi".

Available in physical form direct from website http://HistoryofRnB.net   Download from   Amazon http://www.amazon.co.uk/Those-Hoodlum-Friends-Coasters-Stereo/dp/B00BR0QU6A/ref=dm_cd_album_lnk  iTunes https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/those-hoodlum-friends-coasters/id609884465    Stream from Spotify http://open.spotify.com/album/6IDmQkLUjCQe6poBO4izrg   The Coasters had the benefit of recording in the best studios\, backed by the best musicians and produced by the top producers of their generation\, Leiber and Stoller. Naturally\, they were required to run through as many takes of each song as was necessary to satisfy the exacting demands of their mentors. Luckily for us\, many of these alternate takes have survived. Mono was the standard recording format until the late 1960s\, but many of the big selling artists also recorded alternate versions specifically for the stereo market\, which was targeted to the discerning adult listener.     Disc One features all the alternate stereo versions of Coasters songs that were issued at the time on album and subsequently on CD. Disc Two takes you deep into the heart of Coasters sessions with composite tracks which combine studio chatter together with the finest moments from various different takes. This disc contains several outtakes which have until now been unavailable anywhere and gives an invaluable insight into the genesis of many well-loved tracks and also into the character and working practice of the Coasters and of their producers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller.     The accompanying 24-page booklet includes many rare photos and an exhaustive session discography by Claus Röhnisch. A collection for Coasters and early rock 'n' roll aficionados!

She quickly became a popular attraction. Hall left the Taft in 1940\, taking Dolly with him. In July of 1941 he grew weary of leading a band and turned over his orchestra to Dolly\, renaming it Dolly Dawn and her Dawn Patrol. Dolly was successful leading the group\, but the stress of the job soon got to her. Her singing career was doing quite well\, and she found it easier to book herself solo than with the band. In March of 1942 she gave up the orchestra. COL channel name VAL warholsoup100	0

COL title VAL You Needed Me COL performer VAL Lulu Roman feat. Linda Davis	COL video title VAL Billy Eckstine -- Get Out of Town COL description VAL Billy Eckstine (Pittsburgh\, 8 de julio de 1914 - Pittsburgh\, 8 de marzo de 1993) fue un cantante estadounidense de jazz y música pop. Poseedor de una voz de barítono\, fue durante los años cuarenta una figura carismática de la música popular negra\, al liderar una de las primeras big band de bop y convertirse en el primer cantante negro de baladas románticas (fue llamado el Sinatra negro). Con el paso de los años\, su influencia ha sido considerable en el ámbito del soul y el rhythm and blues.  Eckstine comenzó a cantar a los nueve años y participó en numerosos espectáculos para aficionados. Aunque su vocación había sido la de jugador de fútbol americano\, una grave lesión lo recondujo hacia el mundo de la música. Tras diversos trabajos al oeste de Chicago a finales de los años treinta\, Eckstine fue invitado por Earl Hines para unirse a su Grand Terrace Orchestra en 1939.  Aunque sus primeros éxitos fueron canciones triviales como "Jelly\, Jelly" y "The Jitney Man"\, grabó también varios estándares como "Stormy Monday". Hacia 1943\, se acompañaba de estrellas como Dizzy Gillespie\, Charlie Parker y Sarah Vaughan. Tras formar su propia banda ese año\, contrató a los tres y gradualmente se hizo con más figuras modernas y con futuras estrellas: Wardell Gray\, Dexter Gordon\, Miles Davis\, Kenny Dorham\, Fats Navarro y Art Blakey\, así como con arreglistas como Tadd Dameron y Gil Fuller. La Billy Eckstine Orchestra fue la primera big band bop\, y su líder reflejaba las innovaciones bop adaptando sus armonías vocales a las baladas normales. A pesar del matiz moderno del grupo\, Eckstine encabezó las listas frecuentemente a mediados de los cuarenta\, con temas como "A Cottage for Sale" y "Prisoner of Love". En las giras por Europa y América\, el cantante tocaba también la trompeta\, el trombón de válvulas y la guitarra.  Forzado a disolver la orquesta en 1947 tras haber formado la suya propia Gillespie\, Eckstine realizó una transición hacia un estilo más baladístico y con arreglos de cuerda. Grabó más de una docena de éxitos a finales de los cuarenta\, entre lo que se incluyen "My Foolish Heart" y "I Apologize". Se hizo popular en Gran Bretaña\, obteniendo un gran éxito durante los cincuenta con temas como "No One But You" y "Gigi"\, así como con sus dúos con Sarah Vaughan. Eckstine regresaría a sus raíces jazzísticas ocasionalmente\, grabando con Vaughan\, Count Basie y Quincy Jones\, y grabando un LP en directo\, No Cover\, No Minimum\, en el que interpretaba algunos solos de trompeta. Grabó varios discos para Mercury y Roulette a comienzos de los sesenta y publicó en Motown algunos discos de estándares a mediados de esa década. Tras grabar muy espaciadamente en los setenta\, Eckstine hizo su última grabación (Billy Eckstine Sings with Benny Carter) en 1986. Murió por un ataque al corazón en 1993.

COL title VAL It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) COL performer VAL Chris Connor	COL video title VAL Shirley Bassey - Johnny One Note (1976 Show #1) COL description VAL 1976 (Shirley performs this classic Rodgers & Hart Big Band Style Number 'Johnny One Note' with her own uniquely powerful style\, which is from the Musical 'Babes In Arms\,'  Shirley performed this song on her 1976 TV Variety Show.  Shirley recorded and released this song on her 1966 LP titled\, 'Shirley Bassey - I've Got A Song For You'.  ABOUT Johnny One Note: "Johnny One Note" is a 1937 show tune from the 1937 Rodgers and Hart musical Babes in Arms\, where it was introduced by Wynn Murrary. Judy Garland sang it in the film version\, released in 1939.  The musical contained more great songs Shirley Bassey has also performed: "The Lady Is A Tramp"\, "Where Or When" and "My Funny Valentine".  The 'Babes In Arms' story is about a group of vaudevillians who want to revive their old fashioned form of entertainement by doing a roadshow. "Johnny One Note" is sung as a bedtimestory. A kind of fairy tale about a very ego-centred singer who is so very loud that nobody can hear the soprano. This lady singer asks her godmother to put a spell on Johnny\, so that the next time he wants to impress everybody by holding his note as long as possible he has to held it forever.  Shirley Bassey wrote about "Johnny One Note":   I don't always recognize the right songs for me the first time I hear them. For a long time I was asked to do 'Johnny One Note'\, but I couldn't do it for many\, many years. Then one day Eddie Fisher's musical director just sat at the piano and said\, 'This is a good song for you'\, and started playing 'Johnny One Note'. The way he played it\, I got so excited\, but I said 'I can't do this song'. 'Why not?' he asked. 'Well\, when I was discovered\, the girl whose place I took in the show\, she had a big hit with this song and I've never been able to touch this song.' 'Well\, try it\,' he said. And I was amazed when I opened my mouth: this voice came out singing this song as though it was mine. So\, after all those years - it was about ten years\, I believe - when we actually got down to it\, it was a piece of cake.  LYRICS: Johnny could only sing one note  And the note he sang was this: aaaahh  Poor Johnny One Note  Sang out with Gusto A nd just overloaded the place Poor Johnny One Note  Yelled willy-nilly  Until he was blue in the face For holding one note was his ace  Couldn't hear the brass  Couldn't hear the drum He was in a class  By himself\, by gum Poor Johnny One Note  Got in Aida indeed a great chance to be brave He took his one note  Howled like the North Wind  Brought forth wind that made critics rave While Verdi turned round in his grave  Couldn't hear the flute  Or the big trombone Everyone was mute  Johnny stood alone Cats and dogs stopped yapping  Lions in the zoo  Were all jealous of Johnny's big thrill Thunderclaps stopped clapping  Traffic ceased its roar  And they tell us Niag'ra stood still He stopped the trainwistles  Boatwhistles  Steamwhistles  Copwhistles All whistles bowed to his skill  Sing Johnny One Note Sing out with gusto  And just overwhelm all the crowd  Aaaahh   So sing\, Johnny One Note out loud  Sing\, Johnny One Note  Sing -  Johnny -  One Note -  Out loud  ABOUT the LP\, I've Got A Song For You: I've Got a Song for You is a 1966 album by Shirley Bassey. Bassey had left EMI's Columbia Label\, and this was her first album for United Artists\, a label she would remain with for approximately 14 years. This album and the following release And We Were Lovers were produced by Bassey's former husband\, Kenneth Hume. (Their marriage had ended in divorce in 1965\, but he continued to act as her manager\, and for these two albums\, her producer.) The album entered the UK Albums Chart at #26\, but only remained on the chart for one week\, and failed to chart in the US\, despite her having received outstanding reviews for live engagements in New York and Las Vegas that same year\, and the fact that the album was recorded in New York.

The first known published version of a "Frankie and Johnny" melody appeared in 1904 in the song "He Done Me Wrong (The Death Of Bill Bailey)"\, written by Hughie Cannon.  A variation on the melody\, with words and music by Frank and Bert Leighton\, appeared in 1908 under the title "Bill\, You Done Me Wrong". It was republished in 1912\, credited to the Leighton Brothers and Ren Shields\, as the more commonly recognizable "Frankie and Johnny".  The first known recording of Frankie and Johnny was in 1912\,  a vocal by Gene Greene accompanied by Charlie Straight on a very rare British Pathé 78 rpm disk.  The Leighton brothers recorded it for Victor in 1916 but it was never issued. Al Bernard made the first American recording for Brunswick in May of 1921\, followed a month later by this recording by Frank Crumit with the Biese Trio. In 1927\, Crumit recorded it again for Victor Records using different lyrics. COL channel name VAL bsgs98	0

COL title VAL Mad About the Boy COL performer VAL Dinah Washington	COL video title VAL Sonny & Cher - You Don't Love Me COL description VAL Sonny & Cher proved one of the magical musical combinations of the mid '60s and one of the better rock-influenced MOR acts of the early '70s\, their wisecracking repartee providing counterpoint to a series of adoring hit duets. Salvatore "Sonny" Bono (b. Feb. 16\, 1935) started out at Los Angeles-based Specialty Records as a songwriter in the late '50s\, responsible for "Koko Joe" by Don and Dewey and "She Said Yeah" for Larry Williams\, which was later covered by the Rolling Stones and the Righteous Brothers. Bono became a protégé of Phil Spector\, managing to write a handful of successful songs\, most notably "Needles and Pins" in collaboration with his protégé Jack Nitzsche\, which became a success for Jackie DeShannon and a huge international hit for the Searchers. In 1964\, while working sessions with Phil Spector\, he met an 18-year-old would-be singer named Cherilyn Lapierre (b. May 20\, 1946)\, and the two were later married. They formed a professional duet\, initially as Caesar and Cleo for Vault Records and later Reprise\, but it was only after they were signed to Atlantic Records as Sonny & Cher that success came their way. The couple embarked on parallel careers\, with Cher later signed to Liberty/Imperial Records as a solo act. She subsequently hit with "Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)" while Sonny charted with "Laugh at Me" on Atco\, but their biggest success was as a duet on Atco\, with "I Got You Babe" and "The Beat Goes On."  For a time\, from 1965 until 1967\, they were rock & roll's hottest couple\, so much so that in some conservative communities they were considered almost morally subversive; parents locked up their kids when Sonny and Cher were passing through for a concert appearance. They were popular enough\, and sufficiently well-known in their images that the Rolling Stones impersonated them on the British television music showcase Ready Steady Go\, miming to "I Got You Babe" with Brian Jones subbing for Sonny.  And then nothing -- the hits stopped coming\, and the couple made some daringly creative but unsuccessful commercial missteps\, even a movie (Good Times\, directed by William Friedkin in his debut) that was\, like the Monkees' Head\, too far ahead of its time for critics or all but the most advanced fans to appreciate. A further film effort\, Chastity\, a name shared by their daughter\, also bombed\, and the sudden confrontation of a $200\,000 income tax debt forced the couple to continue working. Further\, they were unable to record because of a dispute with Atlantic over Sonny's objections to the way that Cher's solo career was being handled.  They were playing supper clubs and Las Vegas nightclubs when Johnny Musso\, a friend of the couple's\, was jumping from an executive position at Atlantic to run Decca Records' Kapp label subsidiary\, and brought the duo with him. At around the same time\, their stage act -- which had evolved into a kind of "with it" domestic comedy routine nearly as prominent as the music\, with the tall\, wry-witted Cher cutting up on the seemingly dim-witted Sonny -- was spotted by Fred Silverman\, who was then the head of programming for CBS. They ended up with a summer replacement try-out show that did so well that Sonny & Cher were given a regular spot in the CBS lineup in January 1972 with a comedy-variety series.  The couple's recording career was revived initially by a live album cut in one night at Las Vegas\, featuring new versions of their early hits as well as parts of their current repertory; the album went gold. The first couple of singles by Cher and Sonny & Cher failed\, but then producer Snuff Garrett\, who had been at Liberty when Cher was there but had never worked with her\, was brought in\, and the result was "Gypsies\, Tramps and Thieves\," a career-reviving number one hit. After that\, "The Way of Love\," "All I Ever Need Is You" (which became the theme for their TV show)\, "A Cowboy's Work Is Never Done\," "Half Breed\," and "Dark Lady" kept either Cher or the couple in the Top Ten at various times through 1974. By then\, however\, their marriage had fallen apart\, and with it\, the success of their TV show. ~ Bruce Eder\, All Music Guide COL channel name VAL Sonny And Chers Channel	0
COL title VAL Gocce di pioggia su di me COL performer VAL Patty Pravo	COL video title VAL ♥ "Invitation" - Bill Evans (with Eddie Gomez) COL description VAL Music: Invitation Artists: Bill Evans and Eddie Gomez . You might want to check out this other jazz artist on harp: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QORJxhL27cc  ******************************************************************************************  About the Artists (info from Wikipedia):  William John Evans\, known as Bill Evans (August 16\, 1929 -- September 15\, 1980) was an American jazz pianist. His use of impressionist harmony\, inventive interpretation of traditional jazz repertoire\, and trademark rhythmically independent\, "singing" melodic lines influenced a generation of pianists including: Chick Corea\, Herbie Hancock\, John Taylor\, Steve Kuhn\, Don Friedman\, Denny Zeitlin\, Bobo Stenson\, Michel Petrucciani and Keith Jarrett\, as well as many other musicians world-wide. The music of Bill Evans continues to inspire younger pianists like Marcin Wasilewski\, Fred Hersch\, Bill Charlap\, Lyle Mays\, Eliane Elias[1] and arguably Brad Mehldau\, early in his career.  He is considered the most influential post World War II jazz pianist. Evans is an inductee of the Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame. *** Edgar "Eddie" Gómez (born October 4\, 1944) is a Puerto Rican jazz double bassist born in Santurce\, Puerto Rico\, perhaps most notable for his work done with the Bill Evans trio from 1966 to 1977.  Gómez emigrated with his family at a young age to the United States of America and grew up in New York.  He started on double bass in the New York City school system at the age of eleven and at age thirteen went to the New York City High School of Music and Art. He played in the Newport Festival Youth Band (led by Marshall Brown) from 1959 to 1961\, and graduated from Juilliard in 1963. His impressive résumé includes performances with jazz giants such as Miles Davis\, Dizzy Gillespie\, Gerry Mulligan\, Benny Goodman\, Buck Clayton\, Bill Bruford\, Marian McPartland\, Paul Bley\, Wayne Shorter\, Steps Ahead\, Steve Gadd\, Jeremy Steig\, Herbie Hancock\, Tony Williams\, Al Foster\, Chick Corea\, Eugenio Toussaint and Carli Muñoz. Time lauded: "Eddie Gómez has the world on his strings".  He would spend a total of eleven years with the Bill Evans Trio\, which included performances throughout the United States\, Europe\, and Asia\, as well as dozens of recordings.  Two of the Trio's recordings won Grammy awards. In addition\, he was a member of the Manhattan Jazz Quintet. His career mainly consists of working as an accompanist\, a position suited for his quick reflexes and flexibility.  In addition to working as a studio musician for many famous jazz musicians\, he has recorded as a leader for Columbia Records\, Projazz and Stretch.  Most of his recent recordings as a leader are co-led by jazz pianist Mark Kramer.  *** COL channel name VAL 65Seasons	0

COL title VAL Polka Party! COL performer VAL Weird Al Yankovic	COL video title VAL Donna Summer - MacArthur Park Suite [Original Extended Version] (Casablanca Records 1977) COL description VAL "MacArthur Park" is a song by Jimmy Webb in 1968\, originally composed as part of an intended cantata. Richard Harris was the second to record it. Other covers include Donna Summer's disco arrangement from 1978 and Waylon Jennings's version recorded in 1969. Maynard Ferguson\, Stan Kenton\, and Woody Herman all performed big-band jazz arrangements.   "MacArthur Park" utilized flowery lyrics and metaphors (most famously\, love being likened to a cake left out in the rain) that were considered by media such as the Los Angeles Times to be "polarizing" and "loopy." The inspiration for "MacArthur Park" was the relationship and breakup between Webb and Susan Ronstadt\, a cousin of singer Linda Ronstadt. MacArthur Park was where the two occasionally met for lunch and spent their most enjoyable times together.   In 1978\, "MacArthur Park" by Donna Summer was number one on the American pop music sales charts for three weeks. "MacArthur Park Suite stayed at number one on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Songs chart for five weeks in 1978.  (LYRICS)  Spring was never waiting for us\, dear\, it ran one step ahead\, as we followed in the dance. Between the parted pages\, we were pressed\, In love's hot\, fevered iron like a striped pair of pants. MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark\, All the sweet\, green icing flowing down... Someone left the cake out in the rain\, I don't think that I can take it 'cause it took so long to bake it\, And I'll never have that recipe again\, Again! Aha!  I recall the yellow cotton dress\, foaming like a wave\, on the ground beneath your knees. The birds\, like tender babies in your hands and the old men playing Chinese checkers by the trees. MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark\, All the sweet\, green icing flowing down... Someone left the cake out in the rain\, I don't think that I can take it 'cause it took so long to bake it\, And I'll never have that recipe again\, Again! Aha!  There will be another song for me and I will sing it. They'll be another dream for me\, someone will bring it. I will drink the wine while it is warm and never let you catch me looking at the sun yea\, and after all the loves of my life\, after all the loves of my life you'll still be the one. I will take my life into my hands and I will use it. I will win the worship in their eyes and I will lose it. I will have the things that I desire and my passion flow like rivers from the sky. Oh and after all the loves of my life\, yea\, after all the loves of my life you'll still be the one and I'll ask myself why yea! MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark\, All the sweet\, green icing flowing down... Someone left the cake out in the rain\, I don't think that I can take it 'cause it took so long to bake it\, And I'll never have that recipe again\, Again!  You're one of a kind\, I gotta have ya\, well you're one of a kind\, I need to have ya! Right from the start you tore me apart\, you took the best part of my heart\, Aah! Body and soul\, you took me out of control. You stole the best part of my heart\, Aah! Ooh! You're one of a kind\, you've got magic. I know you're one of a kind\, baby you're static. Right from the start you tore me apart\, you took the best part of my heart\, Aah! Body and soul\, you took me out of control. You stole the best part of my heart\, Aah! Ooh!

Baby please (baby please) please don't take your love from me (please don't take your love from me) I am yours for ever more (ever more) 'til eternity. Silently (so silently) listen to the words I say (listen to the words I say) I'm not talking just for play (just for play) listen to me please (won't you listen to me). Heaven knows it's not the way it should be and heaven knows it's not the way it could be and don't you know there's no need to leave! Heaven knows I never wanna leave you\, heaven knows I only wanna please you\, don't you know love is what I need!   Down inside (down inside) don't get caught with foolish pride (don't get caught with foolish pride) blow the other things aside (things aside) it's only you and me (you and me\, you and)believe in us (believe in us) we were always meant to be (always meant to be) me for you and you for me (you for me) 'til eternity ('til eternity).

COL title VAL Lately COL performer VAL Lola Haag	COL video title VAL Lillian Roth -- Let's Fall in Love COL description VAL Lillian Roth (13 de diciembre de 1910 — 12 de mayo de 1980) fue una actriz y cantante estadounidense.  Nacida en Boston\, Massachusetts\, tenía únicamente seis años de edad cuando su madre la llevó a Educational Pictures\, donde pasó a ser la imagen de la compañía\, simbolizada por una estatua viviente sosteniendo la lámpara del conocimiento. Al año siguiente debutó como actriz teatral en el circuito de Broadway actuando en The Inner Man. Su primera actuación cinematográfica llegó en 1918 con Pershing's Crusaders. Junto a su hermana Ann actuaban de manera itinerante bajo el nombre de "Lillian Roth and Co\," y a veces las dos eran llamadas "The Roth Kids". Uno de los momentos más emocionantes de ambas hermanas llegó cuando conocieron al Presidente de los Estados Unidos Woodrow Wilson\, cuando éste llevó a las dos a dar la vuelta a la manzana en su coche tras asistir al número de vodevil de ambas. Roth entró en la Clark School of Concentration en los inicios de la década de 1920\, actuó en Artists and Models en 1923 y trabajó en Revels con Frank Fay.  En 1927\, cuando Roth tenía 17 años de edad\, trabajó en la primera de tres Earl Carroll Vanities\, a las cuales pronto siguieron las Midnight Frolics\, una producción de Florenz Ziegfeld. Pronto la joven actriz firmó un contrato de siete años con Paramount Pictures. Entre los filmes que rodó para Paramount figuran El desfile del amor (1929\, con Maurice Chevalier)\, The Vagabond King (1930)\, Paramount on Parade (1930)\, Honey (1930\, en el cual cantaba "Sing\, You Sinners")\, Madam Satan (1930\, de Cecil B. DeMille\, con Reginald Denny y Kay Johnson\, Sea Legs (con Jack Oakie)\, y la segunda película de los Hermanos Marx\, El conflicto de los Marx (1930). Roth hizo para el cine el papel que Ethel Merman había interpretado en la obra teatral Take a Chance\, y cantó "Eadie Was a Lady". Tras dejar Paramount hizo un papel de reparto en el film carcelario femenino Ladies They Talk About (Warner Brothers\, 1933)\, junto a Barbara Stanwyck.  Además\, fue cabeza de cartel del Teatro Palace de Nueva York\, actuando en Earl Carroll Vanities en 1928\, 1931 y 1932\, haciendo grandes progresos en su faceta de cantante. Desafortunadamente\, la vida personal de Roth cada vez se veía más ensombrecida por su adicción al alcohol. Roth estuvo fuera del candelero desde finales de la década de 1930 hasta 1953\, cuando actuó en un episodio especial de la serie televisiva This Is Your Life\, con Ralph Edwards. En respuesta a su sinceridad al relatar su historia de alcoholismo\, Roth recibió más de cuarenta mil cartas. En 1962 encarnó a la madre de Elliott Gould en el musical I Can Get It for You Wholesale\, producción en la cual hacía su debut en Broadway Barbra Streisand. A pesar de la gran acogida conseguida por Streisand\, el productor David Merrick observó que el nombre de Roth todavía vendía entradas\, por lo que tras el estreno puso su nombre por encima del de Gould\, Streisand y Sheree North. Roth permaneció en el show durante todas las representaciones\, un total de 301\, y grabó un disco relativo a la obra para Columbia Records.  Roth se casó al menos cinco veces. Sus maridos fueron el aviador William C. Scott ("Willie Richards")\, el juez Benjamin Shalleck\, Eugene J. Weiner ("Mark Harris")\, Edward Goldman ("Vic")\, y Burt McGuire. Antes de su primera boda había tenido una relación con David Lyons\, fallecido de tuberculosis. En mayo de 1932 se divorció de W. C. Scott\, tras trece meses de matrimonio. En 1955 conoció a Thomas Burt McGuire\, ligado a la editora Funk and Wagnalls Publishing Company\, en una reunión de Alcohólicos Anónimos\, grupo en el cual Roth formaba parte desde 1946. .  Roth falleció a causa de un ictus en 1980 en Nueva York. Tenía 69 años de edad. Fue enterrada en el Cementerio Mount Pleasant del Condado de Westchester\, Nueva York.

The first known published version of a "Frankie and Johnny" melody appeared in 1904 in the song "He Done Me Wrong (The Death Of Bill Bailey)"\, written by Hughie Cannon.  A variation on the melody\, with words and music by Frank and Bert Leighton\, appeared in 1908 under the title "Bill\, You Done Me Wrong". It was republished in 1912\, credited to the Leighton Brothers and Ren Shields\, as the more commonly recognizable "Frankie and Johnny".  The first known recording of Frankie and Johnny was in 1912\,  a vocal by Gene Greene accompanied by Charlie Straight on a very rare British Pathé 78 rpm disk.  The Leighton brothers recorded it for Victor in 1916 but it was never issued. Al Bernard made the first American recording for Brunswick in May of 1921\, followed a month later by this recording by Frank Crumit with the Biese Trio. In 1927\, Crumit recorded it again for Victor Records using different lyrics. COL channel name VAL bsgs98	0

Nancy Sue Wilson (February 20\, 1937 – December 13\, 2018) was an American singer whose career spanned over five decades\, from the mid–1950s until her retirement in the early–2010s. She was notable for her single "(You Don't Know) How Glad I Am" and her version of the standard "Guess Who I Saw Today".  On December 13\, 2018\, Wilson died at her home in Pioneertown\, California after a long illness. She was 81 years old.  Is it an earthquake or simply a shock?

You might want to check out this other jazz artist on harp: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QORJxhL27cc  ******************************************************************************************  About the Artists (info from Wikipedia):  William John Evans\, known as Bill Evans (August 16\, 1929 -- September 15\, 1980) was an American jazz pianist. His use of impressionist harmony\, inventive interpretation of traditional jazz repertoire\, and trademark rhythmically independent\, "singing" melodic lines influenced a generation of pianists including: Chick Corea\, Herbie Hancock\, John Taylor\, Steve Kuhn\, Don Friedman\, Denny Zeitlin\, Bobo Stenson\, Michel Petrucciani and Keith Jarrett\, as well as many other musicians world-wide. The music of Bill Evans continues to inspire younger pianists like Marcin Wasilewski\, Fred Hersch\, Bill Charlap\, Lyle Mays\, Eliane Elias[1] and arguably Brad Mehldau\, early in his career.  He is considered the most influential post World War II jazz pianist. Evans is an inductee of the Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame. *** Edgar "Eddie" Gómez (born October 4\, 1944) is a Puerto Rican jazz double bassist born in Santurce\, Puerto Rico\, perhaps most notable for his work done with the Bill Evans trio from 1966 to 1977.  Gómez emigrated with his family at a young age to the United States of America and grew up in New York.  He started on double bass in the New York City school system at the age of eleven and at age thirteen went to the New York City High School of Music and Art. He played in the Newport Festival Youth Band (led by Marshall Brown) from 1959 to 1961\, and graduated from Juilliard in 1963. His impressive résumé includes performances with jazz giants such as Miles Davis\, Dizzy Gillespie\, Gerry Mulligan\, Benny Goodman\, Buck Clayton\, Bill Bruford\, Marian McPartland\, Paul Bley\, Wayne Shorter\, Steps Ahead\, Steve Gadd\, Jeremy Steig\, Herbie Hancock\, Tony Williams\, Al Foster\, Chick Corea\, Eugenio Toussaint and Carli Muñoz. Time lauded: "Eddie Gómez has the world on his strings".  He would spend a total of eleven years with the Bill Evans Trio\, which included performances throughout the United States\, Europe\, and Asia\, as well as dozens of recordings.  Two of the Trio's recordings won Grammy awards. In addition\, he was a member of the Manhattan Jazz Quintet. His career mainly consists of working as an accompanist\, a position suited for his quick reflexes and flexibility.  In addition to working as a studio musician for many famous jazz musicians\, he has recorded as a leader for Columbia Records\, Projazz and Stretch.  Most of his recent recordings as a leader are co-led by jazz pianist Mark Kramer.  *** COL channel name VAL 65Seasons	0
COL title VAL Love Me COL performer VAL 5 DeMarco Sisters	COL video title VAL Sonny & Cher - You Don't Love Me COL description VAL Sonny & Cher proved one of the magical musical combinations of the mid '60s and one of the better rock-influenced MOR acts of the early '70s\, their wisecracking repartee providing counterpoint to a series of adoring hit duets. Salvatore "Sonny" Bono (b. Feb. 16\, 1935) started out at Los Angeles-based Specialty Records as a songwriter in the late '50s\, responsible for "Koko Joe" by Don and Dewey and "She Said Yeah" for Larry Williams\, which was later covered by the Rolling Stones and the Righteous Brothers. Bono became a protégé of Phil Spector\, managing to write a handful of successful songs\, most notably "Needles and Pins" in collaboration with his protégé Jack Nitzsche\, which became a success for Jackie DeShannon and a huge international hit for the Searchers. In 1964\, while working sessions with Phil Spector\, he met an 18-year-old would-be singer named Cherilyn Lapierre (b. May 20\, 1946)\, and the two were later married. They formed a professional duet\, initially as Caesar and Cleo for Vault Records and later Reprise\, but it was only after they were signed to Atlantic Records as Sonny & Cher that success came their way. The couple embarked on parallel careers\, with Cher later signed to Liberty/Imperial Records as a solo act. She subsequently hit with "Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)" while Sonny charted with "Laugh at Me" on Atco\, but their biggest success was as a duet on Atco\, with "I Got You Babe" and "The Beat Goes On."  For a time\, from 1965 until 1967\, they were rock & roll's hottest couple\, so much so that in some conservative communities they were considered almost morally subversive; parents locked up their kids when Sonny and Cher were passing through for a concert appearance. They were popular enough\, and sufficiently well-known in their images that the Rolling Stones impersonated them on the British television music showcase Ready Steady Go\, miming to "I Got You Babe" with Brian Jones subbing for Sonny.  And then nothing -- the hits stopped coming\, and the couple made some daringly creative but unsuccessful commercial missteps\, even a movie (Good Times\, directed by William Friedkin in his debut) that was\, like the Monkees' Head\, too far ahead of its time for critics or all but the most advanced fans to appreciate. A further film effort\, Chastity\, a name shared by their daughter\, also bombed\, and the sudden confrontation of a $200\,000 income tax debt forced the couple to continue working. Further\, they were unable to record because of a dispute with Atlantic over Sonny's objections to the way that Cher's solo career was being handled.  They were playing supper clubs and Las Vegas nightclubs when Johnny Musso\, a friend of the couple's\, was jumping from an executive position at Atlantic to run Decca Records' Kapp label subsidiary\, and brought the duo with him. At around the same time\, their stage act -- which had evolved into a kind of "with it" domestic comedy routine nearly as prominent as the music\, with the tall\, wry-witted Cher cutting up on the seemingly dim-witted Sonny -- was spotted by Fred Silverman\, who was then the head of programming for CBS. They ended up with a summer replacement try-out show that did so well that Sonny & Cher were given a regular spot in the CBS lineup in January 1972 with a comedy-variety series.  The couple's recording career was revived initially by a live album cut in one night at Las Vegas\, featuring new versions of their early hits as well as parts of their current repertory; the album went gold. The first couple of singles by Cher and Sonny & Cher failed\, but then producer Snuff Garrett\, who had been at Liberty when Cher was there but had never worked with her\, was brought in\, and the result was "Gypsies\, Tramps and Thieves\," a career-reviving number one hit. After that\, "The Way of Love\," "All I Ever Need Is You" (which became the theme for their TV show)\, "A Cowboy's Work Is Never Done\," "Half Breed\," and "Dark Lady" kept either Cher or the couple in the Top Ten at various times through 1974. By then\, however\, their marriage had fallen apart\, and with it\, the success of their TV show. ~ Bruce Eder\, All Music Guide COL channel name VAL Sonny And Chers Channel	0

COL title VAL All the Way COL performer VAL Michael Bolton	COL video title VAL Sonny Rollins: Sonnymoon for Two COL description VAL Theodore Walter "Sonny" Rollins (born September 7\, 1930 in New York City) is an American jazz tenor saxophonist. Rollins is widely recognized as one of the most important and influential jazz musicians. A number of his compositions\, including "St. Thomas"\, "Oleo"\, "Doxy"\, and "Airegin"\, have become jazz standards. Rollins was born in New York City\, to parents who were born in the United States Virgin Islands. Rollins received his first saxophone at age 13. He attended Benjamin Franklin High School in East Harlem. He said that a concert by Frank Sinatra there\, accompanied by a plea for racial harmony\, changed his life. His widely acclaimed album Saxophone Colossus was recorded on June 22\, 1956 at Rudy Van Gelder's studio in New Jersey\, with Tommy Flanagan on piano\, former Jazz Messengers bassist Doug Watkins and his favorite drummer Max Roach. This was Rollins' sixth recording as a leader and it included his best-known composition "St. Thomas"\, a Caribbean calypso based on a tune sung to him by his mother in his childhood\, as well as the fast bebop number "Strode Rode"\, and "Moritat" (the Kurt Weill composition also known as "Mack the Knife"). In 1957 he pioneered the use of bass and drums (without piano) as accompaniment for his saxophone solos. This texture came to be known as "strolling". Two early tenor/bass/drums trio recordings are Way Out West (Contemporary\, 1957) and A Night at the Village Vanguard (Blue Note\, 1957). Rollins uses the trio format intermittently throughout his career\, sometimes taking the unusual step of using his sax as a rhythm section instrument during bass and drum solos. Way Out West was so named because it was recorded for a California-based record label (with L.A. stalwart drummer Shelly Manne)\, and because the record included country and western songs such as "Wagon Wheels" and "I'm an Old Cowhand". The Village Vanguard CD consists of two sets\, a matinee with bassist Donald Bailey and drummer Pete LaRoca and then the evening set with bassist Wilbur Ware and drummer Elvin Jones. By 1959\, Rollins was frustrated with what he perceived as his own musical limitations and took the first -- and most famous -- of his musical sabbaticals. To spare a neighboring expectant mother the sound of his practice routine\, Rollins ventured to the Williamsburg Bridge to practice. Upon his return to the jazz scene in 1962 he named his "comeback" album The Bridge at the start of a contract with RCA Records\, recorded with a quartet featuring guitarist Jim Hall and still no piano. The rhythm section was Ben Riley on drums and bassist Bob Cranshaw. This became one of Rollins' best-selling records. Rollins took a sabbatical to study yoga\, meditation\, and Eastern philosophies. When he returned in 1972\, it was clear that he had become enamored of R&B\, pop\, and funk rhythms. His bands throughout the 1970s and 1980s featured electric guitar\, electric bass\, and usually more pop- or funk-oriented drummers. For most of this period he recorded for Milestone Records (The compilation Silver City: A Celebration of 25 Years on Milestone contains a selection from these years.) The 1970s and 1980s were not all disco though and it was during this period that Rollins' passion for unaccompanied saxophone solos came to the forefront. In 1985 he released The Solo Album. Critics such as Gary Giddins and Stanley Crouch have noted the disparity between Sonny Rollins the recording artist\, and Sonny Rollins the concert artist. In a May 2005 New Yorker profile\, Crouch wrote of Rollins the concert artist: "Over and over\, decade after decade\, from the late seventies through the eighties and nineties\, there he is\, Sonny Rollins\, the saxophone colossus\, playing somewhere in the world\, some afternoon or some eight o'clock somewhere\, pursuing the combination of emotion\, memory\, thought\, and aesthetic design with a command that allows him to achieve spontaneous grandiloquence. With its brass body\, its pearl-button keys\, its mouthpiece\, and its cane reed\, the horn becomes the vessel for the epic of Rollins' talent and the undimmed power and lore of his jazz ancestors."... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_Rollins   A link to this wonderful artists personal website: http://www.sonnyrollins.com/   Please Enjoy!

The first known published version of a "Frankie and Johnny" melody appeared in 1904 in the song "He Done Me Wrong (The Death Of Bill Bailey)"\, written by Hughie Cannon.  A variation on the melody\, with words and music by Frank and Bert Leighton\, appeared in 1908 under the title "Bill\, You Done Me Wrong". It was republished in 1912\, credited to the Leighton Brothers and Ren Shields\, as the more commonly recognizable "Frankie and Johnny".  The first known recording of Frankie and Johnny was in 1912\,  a vocal by Gene Greene accompanied by Charlie Straight on a very rare British Pathé 78 rpm disk.  The Leighton brothers recorded it for Victor in 1916 but it was never issued. Al Bernard made the first American recording for Brunswick in May of 1921\, followed a month later by this recording by Frank Crumit with the Biese Trio. In 1927\, Crumit recorded it again for Victor Records using different lyrics. COL channel name VAL bsgs98	0

COL title VAL Ain't That Peculiar COL performer VAL Jackson 5	COL video title VAL Lillian Roth -- Let's Fall in Love COL description VAL Lillian Roth (13 de diciembre de 1910 — 12 de mayo de 1980) fue una actriz y cantante estadounidense.  Nacida en Boston\, Massachusetts\, tenía únicamente seis años de edad cuando su madre la llevó a Educational Pictures\, donde pasó a ser la imagen de la compañía\, simbolizada por una estatua viviente sosteniendo la lámpara del conocimiento. Al año siguiente debutó como actriz teatral en el circuito de Broadway actuando en The Inner Man. Su primera actuación cinematográfica llegó en 1918 con Pershing's Crusaders. Junto a su hermana Ann actuaban de manera itinerante bajo el nombre de "Lillian Roth and Co\," y a veces las dos eran llamadas "The Roth Kids". Uno de los momentos más emocionantes de ambas hermanas llegó cuando conocieron al Presidente de los Estados Unidos Woodrow Wilson\, cuando éste llevó a las dos a dar la vuelta a la manzana en su coche tras asistir al número de vodevil de ambas. Roth entró en la Clark School of Concentration en los inicios de la década de 1920\, actuó en Artists and Models en 1923 y trabajó en Revels con Frank Fay.  En 1927\, cuando Roth tenía 17 años de edad\, trabajó en la primera de tres Earl Carroll Vanities\, a las cuales pronto siguieron las Midnight Frolics\, una producción de Florenz Ziegfeld. Pronto la joven actriz firmó un contrato de siete años con Paramount Pictures. Entre los filmes que rodó para Paramount figuran El desfile del amor (1929\, con Maurice Chevalier)\, The Vagabond King (1930)\, Paramount on Parade (1930)\, Honey (1930\, en el cual cantaba "Sing\, You Sinners")\, Madam Satan (1930\, de Cecil B. DeMille\, con Reginald Denny y Kay Johnson\, Sea Legs (con Jack Oakie)\, y la segunda película de los Hermanos Marx\, El conflicto de los Marx (1930). Roth hizo para el cine el papel que Ethel Merman había interpretado en la obra teatral Take a Chance\, y cantó "Eadie Was a Lady". Tras dejar Paramount hizo un papel de reparto en el film carcelario femenino Ladies They Talk About (Warner Brothers\, 1933)\, junto a Barbara Stanwyck.  Además\, fue cabeza de cartel del Teatro Palace de Nueva York\, actuando en Earl Carroll Vanities en 1928\, 1931 y 1932\, haciendo grandes progresos en su faceta de cantante. Desafortunadamente\, la vida personal de Roth cada vez se veía más ensombrecida por su adicción al alcohol. Roth estuvo fuera del candelero desde finales de la década de 1930 hasta 1953\, cuando actuó en un episodio especial de la serie televisiva This Is Your Life\, con Ralph Edwards. En respuesta a su sinceridad al relatar su historia de alcoholismo\, Roth recibió más de cuarenta mil cartas. En 1962 encarnó a la madre de Elliott Gould en el musical I Can Get It for You Wholesale\, producción en la cual hacía su debut en Broadway Barbra Streisand. A pesar de la gran acogida conseguida por Streisand\, el productor David Merrick observó que el nombre de Roth todavía vendía entradas\, por lo que tras el estreno puso su nombre por encima del de Gould\, Streisand y Sheree North. Roth permaneció en el show durante todas las representaciones\, un total de 301\, y grabó un disco relativo a la obra para Columbia Records.  Roth se casó al menos cinco veces. Sus maridos fueron el aviador William C. Scott ("Willie Richards")\, el juez Benjamin Shalleck\, Eugene J. Weiner ("Mark Harris")\, Edward Goldman ("Vic")\, y Burt McGuire. Antes de su primera boda había tenido una relación con David Lyons\, fallecido de tuberculosis. En mayo de 1932 se divorció de W. C. Scott\, tras trece meses de matrimonio. En 1955 conoció a Thomas Burt McGuire\, ligado a la editora Funk and Wagnalls Publishing Company\, en una reunión de Alcohólicos Anónimos\, grupo en el cual Roth formaba parte desde 1946. .  Roth falleció a causa de un ictus en 1980 en Nueva York. Tenía 69 años de edad. Fue enterrada en el Cementerio Mount Pleasant del Condado de Westchester\, Nueva York.

COL title VAL Indian Summer COL performer VAL Fausto Papetti	COL video title VAL Kris Kristofferson - For the good times (1970) COL description VAL Fair use - no copyright violation intended  "For the good times" from Kris' debut album "Kristofferson". It's so sad and beautiful at the same time...  Great lyrics as always\, and this beautiful tune ... I love it!  Of course this song was not written about Rita and him\, but things always happen twice in one's lifetime...  It was Kris'  first No 1 country hit as a writer in 1970 It was "Song of the Year" (and "Single Record of the Year") of the Academy of Country Music in 1970 - (That was the first time a writer had won "Song of the Year" awards from both the Country Music Association  - with "Sunday Mornin' comin' down"- AND the Academy of Country Music for different songs in the same year)  In 1971 Ray Price won a Grammy Award for "Best Male Country Vocal Performance" with it.  The scenes are from the movies "The last honor of Kathryn Beck"- aka "Act of Passion" (1984) and "Blood and Orchids" (TV\, 1986). Both movies are great to me and worth watching anyway\, but only available on VHS tapes. ... The latter one is available on DVD now http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0035QHNVU  Kris already began to write the song in 1968\, in his Opel\, on one of his endless rides from Nashville to the Gulf.   "I began a song about making love to a woman for the last time. After a while the melody really got to me. I couldn't wait to get to a guitar. I was riding along thinking about that part where it says\, 'Hear the whisper of the raindrops blowin' soft against the window\,' and I wondered if I could play it. I wrote only the first part of the lyrics then. A while went before I finished it\, I can't remember how long.... But I do remember who I wrote it about." Probably it was inspired by the dying days of his relationship to Fran...  Now it's hard to believe that for a time some radio stations wouldn't play the original recording by Bill Nash because of its "overtly sexual content"; indeed for a brief time\, Kris couldn't even find anyone who wanted to record the song... And then? A spokeman for Buckhorn Music\, which published the song shortly before Kris switched to Combine Music\, said later\, "It's recorded by pretty much everyone who comes into town to do an album\, Englebert Humperndinck\, Dean Martin\, Andy Williams\, Chet Atkins\, Loretta Lynn and many more."  For the good times  Don't look so sad\, I know it's over But life goes on and this old world will keep on turning Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together There's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning  Lay your head upon my pillow\, hold your warm and tender body close to mine Hear the whisper of the raindrops blowin' soft against the window And make believe you love me one more time For the good times   I'll get along\, you'll find another  And I'll be here if you should find  you ever need me Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever  There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me   Lay your head upon my pillow Hold your warm and tender body close to mine Hear the whisper of the raindrops Blowin' soft against my window Make believe you love me one more time For the good times   For the good times (1968)  Schau nicht so traurig\, ich weiß\, es ist vorbei. Aber das Leben geht weiter  und diese alte Welt wird sich weiterdrehen. Lass uns einfach froh sein\,  dass wir einige Zeit zusammen verbringen konnten Wir müssen uns nicht die Brücken anschauen\, die wir verbrennen.  Leg deinen Kopf auf mein Kissen\, halte deinen warmen und zärtlichen Körper  dicht an meinen Hör das Flüstern der Regentropfen  weich gegen das Fenster schlagen Und lass mich noch einmal glauben\, dass du mich liebst - wegen der guten Zeiten  Ich werd zurecht kommen\, du wirst einen anderen finden. Und ich werde hier sein falls du je entscheidest\, dass du mich brauchst. Sag kein Wort über das Morgen oder das Fürimmer. Es wird noch genug Zeit sein fürs Traurigsein wenn du mich verlässt...

At least the album cover didn't fall apart on this one like the other one\, but it had no labels  when I removed it from the album.  I found them in like new condition inside the album\, maybe they were so budgeted you had to affix your own labels\, which I'll do with some 3M adhesive.

Join our Youtube: https://goo.gl/8AOGaN Join our Facebook: http://goo.gl/5oL723 Charles Edward Anderson "Chuck" Berry (born October 18\, 1926) is an American guitarist\, singer and songwriter and is one of the pioneers of rock and roll music. With songs such as "Maybellene" (1955)\, "Roll Over Beethoven" (1956)\, "Rock and Roll Music" (1957) and "Johnny B. Goode" (1958)\, Berry refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive\, with lyrics focusing on teen life and consumerism and music featuring guitar solos and showmanship that were a major influence on subsequent rock music. Born into a middle-class African-American family in St. Louis\, Missouri\, Berry had an interest in music from an early age and gave his first public performance at Sumner High School. While still a high-school student he was convicted of armed robbery and was sent to a reformatory\, where he was held from 1944 to 1947. After his release\, Berry settled into married life and worked at an automobile assembly plant. By early 1953\, influenced by the guitar riffs and showmanship techniques of the blues musician T-Bone Walker\, Berry began performing with the Johnnie Johnson Trio. His break came when he traveled to Chicago in May 1955 and met Muddy Waters\, who suggested he contact Leonard Chess\, of Chess Records. With Chess he recorded "Maybellene"—Berry's adaptation of the country song "Ida Red"—which sold over a million copies\, reaching number one on Billboard magazine's rhythm and blues chart. By the end of the 1950s\, Berry was an established star with several hit records and film appearances and a lucrative touring career. He had also established his own St. Louis nightclub\, Berry's Club Bandstand. But in January 1962\, he was sentenced to three years in prison for offenses under the Mann Act—he had transported a 14-year-old girl across state lines.

The 7 Natural Wonders of the World COL description VAL HAPPY FATHER'S DAY!  Note to all my AMP friends: this is a RE-UPLOAD. I first uploaded this song on 05/26/2010 for Father's Day ~WhiteLibraTexas~ --------------------------------------------------------------------  Many lists have been compiled for the Seven Natural Wonders of the World; however\, the list compiled by CNN is the most recognized. Although all of these seven natural wonders are still in existence today\, and are still being adored by many tourists across the globe\, the New7Wonders Foundation launched a campaign in 2007 to select a new list of natural wonders. The declaration of the New Seven Natural Wonders of the World will take place in 2011.  The Following is CNN list of seven breathtaking wonders of the world created by nature itself\, in random order:  1. Magical dancing lights\, performing through the night! -- AURORA BOREALIS (Alaska) 2. A thousand tiny islands in one mountain cupped bay\, no way! -- HARBOR OF RIO DE JANEIRO (Brazil) 3. A canyon so vast\, and carved out of the past! -- GRAND CANYON (USA) 4. A giant coral reef\, with fish beyond belief! -- GREAT BARRIER REEF (Australia) 5.  A mountain so high it almost reaches the sky! -- MOUNT EVEREST (Himalayas) 6.  A volcano that grew\, nearly right in front of you! -- PARICUTIN VOLCANO (Mexico) 7.  Falls so tall\, a dinosaur would feel small! - VICTORIA FALLS (South Africa)       ~Planetpals~ ---------------------------------------------------- DADDY'S LOVE (an acrostic poem)  Daddy's love\, so beautiful Aurora\, you're colorful\, but not as wonderful Daddy's love\, can never be detached Deep Grand Canyon\, you're so vast\, but not a match  Yesterdays\, today and into tomorrows Surpassing all sorrow 'though times are borrowed Love of Daddy\, so solid\, like Mount Kilimanjaro Only his love is indestructible and so magical Victoria Falls\, you're fantastic\, but you don't have his magic  Endless love and wind beneath my wings\, that's my Daddy!  ~I love you\, Daddy! Happy Father's Day - From WhiteLibraTexas~ ----------------------------------------------------------  I picked the featured song\, "Wind Beneath My Wings\," to dedicate to the coolest father on earth\, my Daddy\, and to all the wonderful fathers across the globe\, too. This song describes my feelings for my Daddy\, very perfectly.    This beautiful song has been recorded by many popular artists\, to include Roger Whittaker\, Gladys Knight\, Lou Rawls\, B.J. Thomas\, Sheena Easton\, and Bette Middler\, to name just a few. For this clip\, I am featuring a new version by the Canadian identical twin vocalists\, Ryan and Dan Kowarsky. The twins are now based in London\, England.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I've also uploaded three other Father's Day clips\, featuring the 7 Ancient Wonders of the World\, the New 7 Wonders of the World\, and the 7 Underwater Wonders of the World.

Februar 1922 als Rolf Erich Osterwalder in Bern; † 26. Februar2012 in Luzern) war ein Schweizer Musiker\, Sänger und Orchesterleiter. Zu seinen bekanntesten Stücken gehören der «Kriminal-Tango» und der «Konjunktur-Cha-Cha» («Geh'n Sie mit der Konjunktur»). Osterwald\, der Sohn des Fussballnationalspielers und Buchhalters Adolf Osterwalder\, der ebenfalls den Spitznamen Hazy trug\, begeisterte sich als Schüler eher für Fussball und wurde wegen mangelnden Übens vom Klavierunterricht ausgeschlossen. Mitschüler drängten ihn aber dazu\, Pianist im Schulorchester zu werden. 1939 wurde er dessen Leiter. Ab 1940 besuchte er das Konservatorium und lernte bei Albert Moeschinger Komposition und Theorie\, daneben übte er Trompete. 1940\, ein Jahr vor seiner Matura\, arrangierte er für den Orchesterleiter Teddy Stauffer und andere. 1941 spielte er Trompete in der Band von Fred Böhler\, ab 1942 unter dem Künstlernamen «Hazy Osterwald». Bei den «Original Teddies» des Saxophonisten Eddie Brunner\, dem Nachfolger Stauffers\, spielte er 1944 Klavier und Trompete\, gründete aber im gleichen Jahr eine eigene achtköpfige Combo mit der Sängerin Kitty Ramon. Am 1. September 1944 kam das erste Engagement im Dancing Chikito in Bern. Die Erweiterung zur Bigband erwies sich als zu teuer\, und so gründete er nach dem Vorbild von Svend Asmussen am 1. Mai 1949 sein Sextett\, mit dem er noch im selben Jahr auf dem Festival International 1949 de Jazz in Paris spielte\, wo auch Grössen wie Charlie Parker und Sidney Bechet auftraten.

COL title VAL Peg O' My Heart COL performer VAL Buddy Clark	COL video title VAL Shirley Bassey - Johnny One Note (1976 Show #1) COL description VAL 1976 (Shirley performs this classic Rodgers & Hart Big Band Style Number 'Johnny One Note' with her own uniquely powerful style\, which is from the Musical 'Babes In Arms\,'  Shirley performed this song on her 1976 TV Variety Show.  Shirley recorded and released this song on her 1966 LP titled\, 'Shirley Bassey - I've Got A Song For You'.  ABOUT Johnny One Note: "Johnny One Note" is a 1937 show tune from the 1937 Rodgers and Hart musical Babes in Arms\, where it was introduced by Wynn Murrary. Judy Garland sang it in the film version\, released in 1939.  The musical contained more great songs Shirley Bassey has also performed: "The Lady Is A Tramp"\, "Where Or When" and "My Funny Valentine".  The 'Babes In Arms' story is about a group of vaudevillians who want to revive their old fashioned form of entertainement by doing a roadshow. "Johnny One Note" is sung as a bedtimestory. A kind of fairy tale about a very ego-centred singer who is so very loud that nobody can hear the soprano. This lady singer asks her godmother to put a spell on Johnny\, so that the next time he wants to impress everybody by holding his note as long as possible he has to held it forever.  Shirley Bassey wrote about "Johnny One Note":   I don't always recognize the right songs for me the first time I hear them. For a long time I was asked to do 'Johnny One Note'\, but I couldn't do it for many\, many years. Then one day Eddie Fisher's musical director just sat at the piano and said\, 'This is a good song for you'\, and started playing 'Johnny One Note'. The way he played it\, I got so excited\, but I said 'I can't do this song'. 'Why not?' he asked. 'Well\, when I was discovered\, the girl whose place I took in the show\, she had a big hit with this song and I've never been able to touch this song.' 'Well\, try it\,' he said. And I was amazed when I opened my mouth: this voice came out singing this song as though it was mine. So\, after all those years - it was about ten years\, I believe - when we actually got down to it\, it was a piece of cake.  LYRICS: Johnny could only sing one note  And the note he sang was this: aaaahh  Poor Johnny One Note  Sang out with Gusto A nd just overloaded the place Poor Johnny One Note  Yelled willy-nilly  Until he was blue in the face For holding one note was his ace  Couldn't hear the brass  Couldn't hear the drum He was in a class  By himself\, by gum Poor Johnny One Note  Got in Aida indeed a great chance to be brave He took his one note  Howled like the North Wind  Brought forth wind that made critics rave While Verdi turned round in his grave  Couldn't hear the flute  Or the big trombone Everyone was mute  Johnny stood alone Cats and dogs stopped yapping  Lions in the zoo  Were all jealous of Johnny's big thrill Thunderclaps stopped clapping  Traffic ceased its roar  And they tell us Niag'ra stood still He stopped the trainwistles  Boatwhistles  Steamwhistles  Copwhistles All whistles bowed to his skill  Sing Johnny One Note Sing out with gusto  And just overwhelm all the crowd  Aaaahh   So sing\, Johnny One Note out loud  Sing\, Johnny One Note  Sing -  Johnny -  One Note -  Out loud  ABOUT the LP\, I've Got A Song For You: I've Got a Song for You is a 1966 album by Shirley Bassey. Bassey had left EMI's Columbia Label\, and this was her first album for United Artists\, a label she would remain with for approximately 14 years. This album and the following release And We Were Lovers were produced by Bassey's former husband\, Kenneth Hume. (Their marriage had ended in divorce in 1965\, but he continued to act as her manager\, and for these two albums\, her producer.) The album entered the UK Albums Chart at #26\, but only remained on the chart for one week\, and failed to chart in the US\, despite her having received outstanding reviews for live engagements in New York and Las Vegas that same year\, and the fact that the album was recorded in New York.

Great times Great memories.Cheers Oz Guys I got this info from "Wikipedia" on 'Baby Please Don't Go'    In the 1960s\, "Baby\, Please Don't Go" became a popular rock song after the Northern Irish group Them recorded it in 1964. Several music writers have identified Jimmy Page\, a studio guitarist at the time\, as participating in the recording\, although his exact contributions are unclear. Subsequently\, Them's uptempo rock arrangement has become a rock standard. "Baby\, Please Don't Go" has been inducted into both the Blues and Rock and Roll Halls of Fame.

Is it the good turtle soup or merely the mock? Is it a cocktail\, this feeling of joy? Or is what I feel\, the real McCoy?  Is it for all time or simply a lark?

Join our Youtube: https://goo.gl/8AOGaN Join our Facebook: http://goo.gl/5oL723 George Gershwin (September 26\, 1898 -- July 11\, 1937) was an American composer and pianist. Gershwin's compositions spanned both popular and classical genres\, and his most popular melodies are widely known. Among his best known works are the orchestral compositions Rhapsody in Blue (1924) and An American in Paris (1928)\, as well as the opera Porgy and Bess (1935). Gershwin studied piano under Charles Hambitzer and composition with Rubin Goldmark and Henry Cowell. He began his career as a song plugger\, but soon started composing Broadway theatre works with his brother Ira Gershwin and Buddy DeSylva. He moved to Paris to study with Nadia Boulanger\, where he began to compose An American in Paris. After returning to New York City\, he wrote Porgy and Bess with Ira and the author DuBose Heyward. Initially a commercial failure\, Porgy and Bess is now considered one of the most important American operas of the twentieth century. Gershwin moved to Hollywood and composed numerous film scores until his death in 1937 from a brain tumor. Gershwin's compositions have been adapted for use in many films and for television\, and several became jazz standards recorded in many variations. Countless celebrated singers and musicians have covered his songs.

Bad News Blues  Enjoy!!!   Douglas T. Martin review about this album:            "A studio recording by the same band that recorded the live "Seven Come Eleven"\, this recording finds Joe Pass\, Herb Ellis\, Ray Brown\, and Jake Hanna doing a few covers and reworking some standards into new pieces; "Worksong" becomes "Good News Blues"\, "Sweet Georgia Brown" becomes "Happiness is the Concord Jazz Festival" - well\, it was recorded before their performance at the Concord Jazz Festival. Ellis and Pass support each other brilliantly; and their soloing is off the register. Their recording of "Georgia" is the best I've ever heard - and that's saying something because I'm from Georgia where the Ray Charles' version is sacred. Excellent recording and an invaluable addition to all jazz guitar collections. " COL channel name VAL piccinini02	1

COL title VAL By the Light of the Silvery Moon COL performer VAL Little Richard	COL video title VAL Ned Miller - From A Jack To A King 1963 Philips -- 318 882 PF.wmv COL description VAL enry Ned Miller (born April 12\, 1925\, Rains\, Carbon County\, Utah)[2] is an American country music artist. Active as a recording artist from 1956 to 1970\, he is known primarily for his hit single\, "From a Jack to a King"\, a crossover hit in 1962 which reached Top 10 on the country music\, adult contemporary\, and Billboard Hot 100 charts. He had several more chart singles in his career\, though none matched the peak of "From a Jack to a King". He composed and recorded "Invisible Tears\," which was later recorded by Connie Smith\, Bobby Bare\, and the Ray Conniff Singers.Biography  Miller's start as a songwriter came when he was sixteen years old.[2] He later joined the United States Marine Corps\, from which he was later discharged. In 1956\, both Gale Storm and Bonnie Guitar had Top Five hits with different versions of the song "Dark Moon"\, which Miller co-wrote.[2] Another song he wrote "A Falling Star"\, was a country hit for Jimmy C. Newman. Very notable is also his uptempo song "Cave In"\, which in 1960 was the flip side of Warren Smiths\, #5 country hit "I Don't Believe I'll Fall In Love Today" recorded for the Liberty records label. He also wrote and recorded a song called "From a Jack to a King"\, which was released on Fabor Records but saw little success on the charts.[3] After being briefly signed to Capitol Records\, Miller returned to Fabor and persuaded them to re-release "From a Jack to a King". The song proved successful the second time around\, and became a crossover hit for Miller.[2] It sold over two million copies by July 1963\, and was awarded a gold disc.[4]  Miller was not particularly interested in his singing career\, and rarely toured owing to stage fright.[3] He gave up recording in the 1970s and soon moved to Prescott\, Arizona\, and later to Las Vegas\, Nevada.[3]  Country music artist Ricky Van Shelton covered "From a Jack to a King" in the 1980s; his version reached Number One on the country music chart.[2] [edit] Discography [edit] Albums Year  Album  Chart Positions  Label U.S. Country  U.S. 1963  From a Jack to a King   50  Fabor 1965  Ned Miller Sings the Songs of Ned Miller    Capitol The Best of Ned Miller  28   1967  Teardrop Lane  22   1968  In the Name of Love    1970  Ned Miller's Back    Republic 1981  From a Jack to a King    Plantation [edit] Singles Year  Single  U.S. Country  U.S.  U.S. AC  UK[5]  IRE  Album 1957  "Roll O' Rollin' Stone"  —  —  —  —  —  singles only "From a Jack to a King"  —  —  —  —  — "Lights in the Street"  —  —  —  —  — 1958  "Gypsy"  —  —  —  —  — 1959  "Ring the Bell for Johnny"  —  —  —  —  — 1961  "Cold Gray Bars"  —  —  —  —  — "Dark Moon"  —  —  —  —  — 1962  "From a Jack to a King" (re-release)  2  6  3  2  1  From a Jack to a King 1963  "One Among the Many"  27  —  —  —  — "Another Fool Like Me"  28  —  —  —  —  singles only "Big Love"  —  —  —  —  — 1964  "Invisible Tears"  13  131  —  —  —  The Best 1965  "Do What You Do Do Well"  7  52  —  48  — "Two Voices\, Two Shadows\, Two Faces"  —  —  —  —  —  Songs of Ned Miller "Whistle Walkin'"  28  —  —  —  — "Down the Street"  —  —  —  —  — 1966  "Lovin' Pains"  —  —  —  —  —  The Best "Summer Roses"  39  —  —  —  —  Teardrop Lane "Teardrop Lane"  44  —  —  —  — 1967  "Echo of the Pines"  —  —  —  —  —  singles only "Hobo"  53  —  —  —  — 1968  "Only a Fool"  61  —  —  —  —  In the Name of Love 1969  "Autumn Winds"  —  —  —  —  —  singles only 1970  "Breakin'"  —  —  —  —  — "Lover's Song"  39  —  —  —  —  Ned Miller's Back "Back to Oklahoma"  —  —  —  —  — COL channel name VAL Amnondoowop	0
