(c) Parodudes 2013 Directed by Brent Urmey 3D Animation Directed by Jalon Rairdon  Lyrics: I want my missing links ...  "Now look at them Dodos" -- that's the way they view us They say that Christians are a dead species Then they worship -- macroevolution Monkeys for uncles in your history Now\, that ain't workin' -- after we refute it  Then they tell you -- the Bible's dumb Maybe then your sister was a ring-tailed lemur Maybe then a lizard was your mum They've got to insult us to sway others Because they're missin' the missin' links They've got to lose the Originator They've got to prove these other theories  That little maggot with the earwig and the stinkbug  They're buggies\, but listen here  That little maggot could become an X-man That little maggot needs a billion years  They've got to insult us to sway others Because they're missin' the missin' links They've got to use their imaginations They've got to prove these other theories  Sure they mean well ... Huh?  They've got to insult us to sway others Because they're missin' the missin' links Get God removed from the situation They've got to prove these other theories  They should've learned they're playin' with fire They could get burned\, but they get numb Look at that drama they got from trickin' us with Java Man  Ain't that guy handsome? And what's up with that? Who's that? Why's that annoy us? There ain't no right and wrong -- we're like the chimpanzees Oh\, that ain't workin' -- macroevolution Monkeys for uncles in your history  Listen up  Oh\, that ain't workin' -- that's the way I view it I beg to differ on your empty theory That ain't workin' -- that's no way to prove it Get your monkeys for uncles in your history Monkeys for uncles -- history Monkeys for uncles -- missing links  I want my\, I want my\, I want my missing links I want my\, I want my\, I want my missing links  Romans 1:21 For although they knew God\, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him\, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened.

COL title VAL Diverso dagli altri COL performer VAL Iva Zanicchi	COL video title VAL "How Ya Gonna Keep 'Em Down on the Farm?" (Nora Bayes\, 1919) COL description VAL America was as quick in getting out of Europe following World War One as she was tardy in entering that conflict. As a nation\, we were forever transformed...America's involvement in World War One brought a change of character with it\, and that change was felt nowhere more keenly than Rural America. Looking back\, the family farm has been in decline ever since. Walter Donaldson wrote the music to this in 1919 (Joe Young and Sam M. Lewis wrote the words)\, and the song wound up being an overnight smash hit. It was recorded by nearly everyone\, but no rendition was more sublimely spirited than this one\, recorded for Columbia by Nora Bayes - a vaudeville talent of legendary proportions.   HOW YA GONNA KEEP 'EM DOWN ON THE FARM?  Reuben\, Reuben\, I've been thinking Said his wifey dear Now that all is peaceful and calm The boys will soon be back on the farm Mister Reuben started winking and slowly rubbed his chin He pulled his chair up close to mother And he asked her with a grin  How ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm After they've seen Paree' How ya gonna keep 'em away from Broadway Jazzin around and paintin' the town How ya gonna keep 'em away from harm\, that's a mystery They'll never want to see a rake or plow And who the deuce can parleyvous a cow? How ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm After they've seen Paree'?  How ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm After they've seen Paree' How ya gonna keep 'em away from Broadway Jazzin around and paintin' the town How ya gonna keep 'em away from harm\, that's a mystery Imagine Reuben when he meets his Pa He'll kiss his cheek and holler "OO-LA-LA! How ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm After they've seen Paree'? COL channel name VAL RReady555	0
COL title VAL Don't You Feel My Leg COL performer VAL The Dirty Dozen Brass Band	COL video title VAL Run To The Hills -Robin Mcauley (Msg) COL description VAL Run To The Hills  Vocals - Robin Mcauley (Msg) Guitar - Michael Schenker (Msg) Bass - Tony Franklin (The Firm\, Blue Murder) Rhythm Guitar - Pete Fletcher (Pygmy Love Circus) Drums - Brian Tichy (Billy Idol\, Ozzy Osbourne)  NUMBERS FROM THE BEAST es un album tributo a la gran banda Iron Maiden\, lo caracteristico de este disco\, es que los covers no son echos por una banda con una unica alineacion\, si no que se juntan diferentes musicos\, de diferentes bandas para crear una sola pieza musical. Lo que atrae de los covers como siempre e dicho\, es la curiosidad de como se escucha tal cancion con tal vocalista\, el morbo de escuchar una cancion tocada por diferentes personas.  Para disfrutar de este recopilatoria\, tienes que quitarte la imagen de como es la cancion\, no esperes algo igual o "muy parecido"\, recordemos que cada musico aporta algo que hace unica cualquier cancion\, ya sea un cover como es este caso.  Como se observa en la track list\, hay una gran variedad de musicos\, entre ellos vi a Paul Di'anno\, que como todos saben fue ex-integrante de Iron Maiden\, no podian faltar Lemmy o Ripper\, tambien veo a chuck de testament\, tambien esta Chris Jericho de WWE que la neta yo ni sabia que tenia una banda.  En fin hay para todos los gustos\, lo unico malo que vi en el disco es que faltaron algunos temas. COL channel name VAL el juanito	0

Come a little bit closer\, you're my kind of man So big and so strong Come a little bit closer\, I'm all alone And the night is so long. Hmmmm. So we started to dance\, in my arms she felt so inviting Mmmmmm\, I just couldn't resist\, a-just a-one little kiss so exciting Then I heard the guitar player say\, va-moose\, Jose's on his way And I knew\, yes I knew\, I should run\, but then I heard her say. Come a little bit closer\, you're my kind of man So big and so strong Come a little bit closer\, I'm all alone And the night is so long. Ha\, ha\, ha\, alright. Laaa-laaa\, la-la\, laaa-laaa\, la-la Laaa-laaa\, la-la\, laaa-laaa\, la-la Then the music stopped\, when I looked\, the cafe was empty Then I heard Jose say\, man\, you know you're in trouble plenty So I dropped my drink from my hand\, and out through the window I ran And as I rode away\, I could hear her say to Jose. Come a little bit closer\, you're my kind of man So big and so strong Come a little bit closer\, I'm all alone And the night is so long. Come a little bit closer\, you're my kind of man So big and so strong Come a little bit closer\, I'm all alone And the night is so long.

COL title VAL Have You Seen My Baby COL performer VAL Fats Domino	COL video title VAL Ooh La La - Tim Timebomb and Friends COL description VAL Originally released in 1973\, this song was written by Ronnie Lane and Ron Wood for the Faces’ third album\, also called ‘Ooh La La.’ As soon as Travis Barker heard my demo for this song\, he wanted to play on it\, we recorded at his studio the next day and made the video the day after. I have a long working relationship with both Travis and J Bonner. J is brilliant reggae bass player that I’ve played with and worked with me on "Poet’s Life" and the Jimmy Cliff album. Travis is in the Transplants with me. I’m so fortunate to get to play with these guys. In the video\, there’s a shot of me standing on a garbage can on the corner of Durant and Telegraph\, in the distance you can see the church where my parents were married in 1958.

COL title VAL Fire COL performer VAL Lizzy Mercier Descloux	COL video title VAL The Crazy World of Arthur Brown-Fire  (1968) COL description VAL "Fire" is a 1968 song by Arthur Brown\, Vincent Crane\, Mike Finesilver and Peter Ker. Performed by the Crazy World of Arthur Brown\, it was released as a single and on the band's debut album\, also called The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. The single made #1 in the UK (in August 1968) and Canada. In October\, it made #2 in the US Billboard charts and #19 in Australia. It also made number 6 in The Netherlands.  The song is an example of the psychedelic rock of the period\, though its lack of guitars distinguished it from many of its contemporaries. The lead instrument in this case was Vincent Crane's Hammond electronic organ\, augmented by an orchestral section featuring prominent brass. The singer's opening proclamation of himself as "the god of hellfire" became a lasting epithet.  *i posted this video only for entertainment purposes* COL channel name VAL elodd90	1

COL title VAL Come a Little Bit Closer COL performer VAL Trini Lopez	COL video title VAL Nancy Sinatra & Lee Hazlewood: Some Velvet Morning COL description VAL The second song I ever really loved.   I have loved & lived with this song all my life and it is one of my favourite top 10 tracks of all time.   Track Meaning:  One day when the male character in the song is sober and has his head "straight"\, he will impart something of significance to his current love about his earliest & deepest love\, a woman named "pheadra" whose memory he is still haunted by.  Hence the repetition of the Pheadra/ Nancy portion of the song . . .  her section symbolising the "haunting" and struggle inside his head as he tries to gain "closure" from this past relationship with a mysterious former love Pheadra . . . his part of the song being directed to his new lover in the present.    His present lack of sobriety (drunkeness) describing his vain attempts to drown out the all consuming memory of this mysterious former love\, a memory that he is aware is annoying his present lover and describes his fear that she may leave him as a result of his "haunting" by his old (first)love.  Note:  At the point in history this song was written the labels of "straight" (meaning hetrosexual) and "gay" (meaning homosexual) did not yet exist.  In fact by the late sixties the term "gay" was just another word for "happy". COL channel name VAL calicomoonchild	0

Purchase from the label: http://www.paradiseofbachelors.com/shop/pob-21 Purchase from Bandcamp: https://paradiseofbachelors.bandcamp.com/album/ambsace Other options: http://lnk.to/PoB21  The second album of astonishing duets by guitarists James Elkington (who has toured and/or recorded with Jeff Tweedy\, Richard Thompson\, and Steve Gunn\, among others) and Nathan Salsburg (an accomplished soloist deemed by NPR “one of those names we’ll all associate with American folk guitar”) is a sublime suite of nimble\, filigreed compositions by two singular stylists. Belying its title—“ambsace” is the lowest throw of dice; snake eyes—the record thrives on a gentle empathy and generosity of spirit\, sitting sneakily protean original compositions alongside gorgeous arrangements of songs by Duke Ellington and The Smiths at the same big hand-hewn table.

Real Around the Fountain Q-Burn's Abstract Message  ------------------------  "Panic" is a song by the British alternative rock band The Smiths\, written by singer Morrissey and guitarist Johnny Marr. The first recording to feature new member Craig Gannon\, "Panic" bemoans the state of contemporary pop music\, and implores its listeners to "burn down the disco" and "hang the DJ" in retaliation. "Panic" was released by Rough Trade Records as a non-album single in 1986\, reaching number 11 in the UK Singles Chart.  Background and recording  The Smiths recorded "Panic" at London's Livingston Studios in May 1986. It was the group's first recording sessions since they completed work on their third album The Queen Is Dead six months earlier. During the interim period\, bassist Andy Rourke had been sacked due to his drug addiction. The band recruited Craig Gannon to replace him\, but after they re-employed Rourke\, guitarist Johnny Marr offered Gannon a position as second guitarist.  Composition and lyrics  A story circulated as the basis for the song is that days before recording the song\, Marr and Morrissey were listening to BBC Radio One when a news report announced the Chernobyl disaster. Straight after the report\, disc jockey Steve Wright played the song "I'm Your Man" by pop duo Wham!. "I remember actually saying\, 'What the fuck has this got to do with people's lives?'" Marr recalled. "We hear about Chernobyl\, then\, seconds later\, we're expected to jump around to 'I'm Your Man'". While Marr subsequently stated that the account was exaggerated\, he commented that it was a likely influence on Morrissey's lyrics.[4] The band even commissioned a t-shirt featuring Wright's portrait and the phrase "Hang the DJ!"  Journalist Nick Kent described "Panic" as a mandate for "rock terrorism". Musically\, the song is based around a rotation between the G and E minor chords that mimicks "Metal Guru" by the glam rock band T.Rex. The song begins with Morrissey mentioning chaos unravelling throughout Britain and Ireland (specifically naming locales such as Dublin\, Dundee\, Carlisle and Humberside). In the second part of the song\, Morrissey reveals that the source of this chaos is pop music\, which in his words "Says nothing to me about my life". In reaction\, Morrissey implores listeners to "Burn down the disco" and "hang the DJ"\, the latter lyrics repeated with the addition of a chorus of schoolchildren. Morrissey considered the fact that the song appeared on daytime British radio a "tiny revolution" in its own way\, as it aired amongst the very music it criticised.  Release and reception  "Panic" drew fire from critics who construed Morrissey's lyrics to have a racist connotation\, due to their disparagement of the "disco" and the "DJ". The criticism was intensified by comments Morrissey made in a September 1986 Melody Maker interview with Frank Owen\, where the singer denounced a "black pop conspiracy". Marr in particular was incensed by the article and threatened to "kick the living shit" out of the writer if he crossed the band's path. Marr countered that "disco music" could not be equated with "black music"; he argued\, "To those who took offence at the 'burn down the disco' line [. . .] I'd say please show me the black members of New Order!"  "Panic" reached number eleven on the UK Singles Chart and stayed on the chart for eight weeks. The single also stayed on the Irish Singles Chart for five weeks\, reaching a peak of number seven\, and reached number thirty-two on the Dutch Top 40. "Panic" was voted Single of the Year by the annual NME readers poll\, and also ("somewhat incongruously"\, noted Smiths biographer Simon Goddard) ranked sixth in the Best Dance Record category. In 2007\, NME placed "Panic" at number 21 in its list of the 50 Greatest Indie Anthems Ever. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

COL title VAL I Wish It Could Be Christmas Every Day COL performer VAL Denny Laine	COL video title VAL Rusty Draper -- My Resistance Is Low COL description VAL Rusty Draper  Farrell H. Draper (25 enero 1923 hasta 28 marzo 2003)\,  conocido profesionalmente como Rusty Draper \, era un cantante americano de Pop que logró su mayor éxito en la década de 1950.  Nacido en Kirksville\, Missouri (el apodo de "Rusty" era por su pelo rojo) comenzó a actuar en el programa de radio de su tío en Tulsa \, Oklahoma a mediados de la década de 1930. Draper pasó a trabajar en las estaciones de radio en Des Moines \, Iowa  (veces tomando el lugar del locutor deportivo Ronald Reagan) \, y en Illinois antes de instalarse en California . Allí comenzó a cantar en  clubes \, convirtiéndose en el cantante oficial del casino de San Francisco . A principios de la década de 1950 había empezado a aparecer en programas de televisión nacionales\, incluyendo The Ed Sullivan Show (CBS) y Ozark Jubilee (ABC).  En 1952\, Draper firmó con Mercury Records y lanzó su primera grabación  \, "How Could You (ojos azules)". Al año siguiente\, después de una gira nacional de clubes\, su versión de  Jim Lowe's "Gambler's Guitar" 's llegó al N º 6 en las listas de éxitos de todo el paçis\, y vendió un millón de copias\, consiguiendo  un disco de oro.  Tras una serie de éxitos menores\, volvió a lo más alto en 1955 con "Seventeen" (N º 18)\, "El Shifting\, Whispering Sands" (N º 3) y "Are You Satisfied?" (No. 11)\, convirtiéndose en uno de los cantantes  de pop  con más éxito de la época.  En 1962\, firmó con con Monument Records \, con cada vez menos éxito en las listas ya que su estilo se fue quedando anticuado. Sin embargo\, él continuó teniendo éxitos menores durante la década de 1960.  Apareció en musicales de teatro y en la televisión\,  Draper murió de neumonía \, en Bellevue\, Washington \, a la edad de 80 años.

COL title VAL Dark Hollow COL performer VAL Luke Gordon	COL video title VAL Rudy A Message To You - The Locomotive (1967) COL description VAL Locomotive formed in Birmingham\, England originally as a jazz band and by the mid 60s they were taking great influence from early ska music brought to the city by Jamaicans who were finding work in the industrial heartland of Britain.   Although there were other white musicians dabbling in Jamaican Ska in the early 60s\, Locomotive were possibly the earliest British band to experiment with Ska in an authentic way\, and as a white 'band' were probably quite ahead of their time considering they made it to vinyl.    While Brumbeat bands and artists such as 'Spencer Davis Group'\, 'The Move' and 'Robert Plant' were mimicking the blues of black America\, Locomotive were looking more to the West Indies for their inspiration\, which\, today\, could be considered a short-cut to a cooler sound than black American blues\, which by this time had taken a step in a completely different direction "heavy metal".  Locomotive's later styles included Soul\, Psychedelia and a fade into the prog rock era with Norman Haines eventually going it alone.  This is the first cover of Dandy Livingstone's "Rudy A Message To You"\, recorded in the same year as the original in late 1967 and is B-Side to "Broken Heart" on the Direction label. It was recorded over a decade before the seminal Specials version.   There were several notable band members such as Chris Wood who went on to join supergroup 'Traffic'\,  Mike Kellie of 'Spooky Tooth' and Bob Lamb who was the producer for 70s dub reggae band 'UB40'.

COL description VAL 118 years ago to this date\, an event would transpire that would serve as the basis for the murder ballad Duncan and Brady that is still commonly played to this day. On October 6\, 1880\, Patrolman James Brady was shot and killed at the Charles Starkes Saloon in downtown Saint Louis\, Missouri. A man by the name of Harry Duncan would be arrested\, convicted and executed for the crime.  The prevailing legend is that the crime was something of a reaction to police harassment of African-Americans in the area\, which at the time was the "red light" district of Saint Louis. It all started with a simple brawl at the saloon that exploded into gunfire when police arrived on the scene and tried to take suspects into custody. Brady was hit in the hail of bullets and would die from his wounds. COL channel name VAL David Albion	0

COL title VAL Style COL performer VAL Ebony Day	COL video title VAL Neil Diamond - Cherry Cherry (REMASTERED) COL description VAL Remastered by Figago - High Quality   Neil Leslie Diamond (born on January 24\, 1941) is an American singer-songwriter. As a successful pop music performer\, Diamond scored a number of hits worldwide in the 1960s\, 1970s\, and 1980s. According to David Wild\, common themes in Diamond's songs are "a deep sense of isolation and an equal desire for connection. A yearning for home -- and at the same time\, the allure of greater freedom. The good\, the bad and the ugly about a crazy little thing called love."  As of 2001 Diamond has 115 million records sold worldwide\, including 48 million records in the U.S. In terms of Billboard chart success\, he is the third most successful Adult Contemporary artist ever\, ranking behind only Barbra Streisand and Elton John.  Though his record sales declined somewhat after the 1980s\, Diamond continues to tour successfully\, and maintains a very loyal following. Diamond's songs have been recorded by a vast array of performers from many different musical genres.  Diamond was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1984\, and in 2000 received the Sammy Cahn Lifetime Achievement Award.  In 1966 Diamond signed a deal with Bert Berns's Bang Records label\, which was then a subsidiary company of Atlantic Records. His first release on that label\, "Solitary Man"\, was his first hit. Prior to the release of "Solitary Man\," Neil had considered using a stage name; he came up with two possible stage names\, "Noah Kaminsky"[citation needed] and "Eice Chary"[citation needed]. But when asked by Bang Records which name he was going to use\, Noah\, Eice\, or Neil\, he thought of his grandmother\, who died prior to the release of Solitary Man. Thus he told Bang Records\, "...go with Neil Diamond and I'll figure it out later." Diamond followed it with "Cherry\, Cherry"\, "Kentucky Woman"\, "Thank the Lord for the Night Time"\, "Do It\," and others. Diamond's Bang recordings were produced by legendary Brill Building songwriters Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich\, both of whom can be heard singing background on many of the tracks...

Otto canzoni\, in gran parte cover\, in cui la voce del "nero a metà" della musica napoletana si rivela in tutta la sua carismatica espressività. Un album sospeso tra rhythm'n'blues\, rock'n'roll e tanto soul in cui spicca la presenza di alcuni "turnisti" d'eccezione che rispondono ai nomi di Pino Daniele e Enzo Avitabile. Di grande intensità le riletture di "Arrivederci"\, il capolavoro di Umberto Bindi che dà giustamente il titolo al disco; assolutamente trascinante l'interpretazione di "True fine mama" di Little Richards ; decisamente eleganti le rarefatte atmosfere della celeberrima "Giorgia on my mind" di Ray Charles" e di "Entriamo nel gioco"\, versione italiana di quella "You make me feel a brand new" portata al successo dai Simply Red" vent'anni dopo.  Ancor prima di essere un eccezionale documento storico\, "Arriverdeci" è un album che testimonia alla perfezione la grandezza di un interprete come non ce ne sono stati più.

COL title VAL Wight Is Wight COL performer VAL Michel Delpech	COL video title VAL "Motown Classics" "Kim Weston Take Me In Your Arms (Rock Me A Little While) Alternate Version" COL description VAL "This is an alternate vocal take of the classic Motown hit\, "Take Me In Your Arms (Rock Me A Little While)"  "Kim Weston- ask any avid Motown fan\, the ones REALLY additcted to the label's music\, about Kim Weston and I'll make a bet that 100% of them will tell you Motown REALLY dropped the ball on a phenomenal talent...  Here is an alternate version of perhaps Kim's best-known song for the company (at least\, best-known to the public in general.)     Take Me In Your Arms (Rock Me A Little While) was a firestorm that came from the forever-astonishing team of Holland-Dozier-Holland.  Eddie Holland actually put his vocals down first.  Notes from the Kim Weston Motown Anthology state that the song was slated for Martha and the Vandellas.  The song was then assigned to Kim\, and Motown's studio A caught fire and disintigrated.  How the studio didn't burn to the ground as this woman lit fire to the already-burning H-D-H track is a mystery.  The commercial version certainly was a firecracker but this alternate version recently released...  fire alarms will sound\,  walls will crumble\,  speakers will explode\,  you'll be turned into ashes.  I don't know\, maybe Kim decided to just give it hell\, maybe H-D-H wanted one more take and Kim was tired and decided if they wanted one more take\, then she would give them something they'd never forget.  Whatever factored into this take\, Kim takes the vocals to asonishingly explosive heights and hits notes that must have brought down any and all aircraft flying in the vicinity of Hitsville U.S.A.  Notice too her lightning-fast phrasing going into the choruses  (almost like those triple-time raps hip hop artists pull of so easily today.)    People must have really been paying attention to this song because the Doobie Brothers did a cover of the song that accomplished the fantastic feat of sounding thouroughly like a Doobie Brothers original and yet keeping a lot of that fantastic\, classic Motown Sound at the same time.    Kim Weston was a woman who was able to shift gears easily between the Motown Sound and ballads and standards.  Wonderfully\, there have been recent releases on cd to showcase all of her amazing recordings as well as the ones that were kept in the vaults.  Here is just one of those tracks that were kept behind\, so enjoy and keep the fire extinguisher nearby!  Special notice should be given to Benny Benjamin's explosive drumming on this song.  I don't know the correct term for it\, but to me it's like a double-time swing beat.  To keep that beat in perfect time is amazing enough\, but to toss in those trademark Benjamin drum fills is almost unbelievable. I don't know of anyone else who could toss those fills in and make it sound so easy."  also: "it takes two marvin gaye and kim weston" "kim weston helpless" "the doobie brothers take me in your arms (rock me a little while)"  "Greatest Motown Songs Of All Time - Motown Classic Songs Playlist - Best Motown Music Hits 60's Kim Weston Songs  Motown Songs" COL channel name VAL Motown Deep Cuts\, PAMS Jingles & More with Tomovox	0

Lo que atrae de los covers como siempre e dicho\, es la curiosidad de como se escucha tal cancion con tal vocalista\, el morbo de escuchar una cancion tocada por diferentes personas.  Para disfrutar de este recopilatoria\, tienes que quitarte la imagen de como es la cancion\, no esperes algo igual o "muy parecido"\, recordemos que cada musico aporta algo que hace unica cualquier cancion\, ya sea un cover como es este caso.  Como se observa en la track list\, hay una gran variedad de musicos\, entre ellos vi a Paul Di'anno\, que como todos saben fue ex-integrante de Iron Maiden\, no podian faltar Lemmy o Ripper\, tambien veo a chuck de testament\, tambien esta Chris Jericho de WWE que la neta yo ni sabia que tenia una banda.  En fin hay para todos los gustos\, lo unico malo que vi en el disco es que faltaron algunos temas. COL channel name VAL el juanito	1

COL title VAL Work to Do COL performer VAL Vanessa Williams	COL video title VAL The Mar-Keys - Last Night COL description VAL The Mar-Keys\, formed in 1958\, were an American studio session band for the Stax label from Memphis\, Tennessee\, in the 1960s. As the first house band for the label\, their backing music formed the foundation for the early 1960s Stax sound.  The group began as The Royal Spades and had tried unsuccessfully to get a record made for the local Satellite Records even though tenor sax player Charles "Packy" Axton's mother and uncle owned that label. When they were finally able to get a record made\, Axton's mother Estelle Axton convinced the group to change their name and they chose The Mar-Keys.  They also recorded organ and saxophone oriented singles of their own\, scoring a number three hit nationally with "Last Night" in 1961. It sold over one million copies\, earning gold disc recognition. Keyboards were played by Jerry Lee "Smoochy" Smith. Other singles of theirs from the early 1960s include "Philly Dog" and "Popeye Stroll." Members of this rhythm section later formed other nationally prominent Memphis studio session groups\, including the Memphis Horns\, the Packers\, and Booker T. & the M.G.'s. Each of these offshoot groups also recorded popular instrumental albums of their own\, in addition to serving as the backing band on albums by dozens of rock\, R&B\, and soul music stars on Stax\, Volt and other national labels. The legacy of the Mar-Keys and later groups was that of having been key players in the development of soul music styles like Southern soul and Memphis soul.

She Drives Me Crazy (Written-By - Fine Young Cannibals)  ------------------------  She Drives Me Crazy" is a song recorded by the Fine Young Cannibals\, included on their 1989 album The Raw and the Cooked. The song peaked at #5 as a single in the band's native UK in January 1989 (it was released on New Year's Day) before hitting #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S. on 15 April 1989. It appeared on The Raw and Cooked album the following month.  It also made number 3 on the Dutch Top 40. A remixed version was released in 1997.  The unique snare drum "pop" sound was created by recording the snare drum portion separately. A speaker was then placed on top of the snare drum\, and a microphone below. The original recording of the snare drum part was played back through the speaker and re-recorded.  Music video  Two music videos were produced for the song\, one by Philippe Decouflé and one by Pedro Romhanyi. Similar to Decouflé's only other music video\, New Order's "True Faith"\, his version includes extensive choreography and performers in unusual costumes\, including two identical dancers with completely different coloured-outfits\, as well as a person with a television on their head. This version received several nominations at the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards\, including Best Video. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

Her style was a hybrid of Brill Building-style New York pop\, jazz\, gospel\, rhythm and blues\, show tunes\, rock and soul.  She was best known\, and enjoyed her greatest commercial success\, as a composer and lyricist rather than as a performer. Between 1968 and 1970 a number of other singers had significant hits with her songs: The 5th Dimension with "Blowing Away"\, "Wedding Bell Blues"\, "Stoned Soul Picnic"\, "Sweet Blindness"\, "Save The Country" and "Black Patch"; Blood\, Sweat & Tears and Peter\, Paul & Mary with "And When I Die"; Three Dog Night with "Eli's Coming"; and Barbra Streisand with "Stoney End"\, "Time and Love"\, and "Hands off the Man (Flim Flam Man)". Nyro's best-selling single was her recording of Carole King and Gerry Goffin's "Up on the Roof."   Lyrics:  Loving you so I was too blind to see you letting me go But now that you've set me free It's gonna take a miracle Yes\, it's gonna take a miracle To make me love someone new Cause I'm crazy for you  Oh oh\, didn't you know It wouldn't be so easy lettin' you go I could have told you that it's gonna take a miracle  oh-uh Yes\, it's gonna take a miracle To make me love someone new Cause I'm crazy for you  Oh\, tho' I know I can't forget? about you or come so? will show you how much You're turning me around\, destroying me I'll never be the same anymore  You must realize You took your love and left me Quite by surprise You can be sure that now it's gonna take a miracle Yes\, it's gonna take a miracle To make me love someone new Cause I'm crazy for you COL channel name VAL Mr.Lotsopa	1

COL title VAL Isaac Man COL performer VAL ApologetiX	COL video title VAL NYSF Threepenny Opera - 19 - Call From the Grave COL description VAL This is an LP transfer of the 1976 New York Shakespeare Festival's revival production of "The Threepenny Opera."  This recording should not be confused with the original 1954 New York production recording\, nor the 1994 Donmar Warehouse production recording in England.  Unlike Marc Blitzstein's version which ran during the 1950's for six years and featured the incomparable Lotte Lenya\, this translation is less sanitized and more in keeping with the seedy and sexual nature of the original german play.    From the liner notes to the album - "the successful Blitzstein version was an adaptation rather than a translation\, and in comparing it to the original\, we were surprised at the extent to which his treatment vitiated the political and sexual thrust which gives the work its relentless power.  Blitzstein sweetened and cleaned up Brecht's unsparing lyrics\, partially in deference to stage censorship...but in doing so he in many instances changed Brecht's meanings around entirely\, and throughout he softened the impact of Brecht's biting ferocity.  He also attempted to make the lyrics more 'singable' by fitting them into conventional musical patterns\, and in this he succeeded admirably."  The translation used for this revival was prepared by Ralph Maheim and John Willett; the full text can be found in their edition of Brecht's Collected Plays\, Volume 2.  A hardcover edition was also published in conjunction with the revival.  This revival was directed by conceptual theater artist Richard Foreman\, and starred Raul Julia and Ellen Greene\, both of whom were nominated for Tony Awards.  It was produced by Joseph Papp and the New York Shakespeare Festival at the Vivian Beaumont Theatre at Lincoln Center.  Additional information regarding the production\, including cast list\, can be found at the Internet Broadway Database's listing for this revival at http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=3835 ...  As of June 2007\, this cast album has not been released or reissued on CD; it was originally made available in 1976 on LP\, and this is an LP transfer.  As such\, the quality is not CD quality  - there will occasionally be noise\, popping\, or hissing.

Versjon fra albumet "Velvalgte viser".  Dette er en sang som jeg liker veldig godt og som betyr veldig mye for meg. ___________________________________  Ja fysst så vil je nevne min stilling og min stæinn\, je står og svarver hatter i Salomo sitt læinn. Sjøl bær je navnet Jørgen\, så skilnaden er stor\, men både je og Salomo kom nakne tel vår jord.  Refr.:  Sola skin på deg så skuggen fell på meg men graset er grønt for æille.  Når liljene på marken i fager blomstring står\, og alle himlens fugler sin glade trille slår\, je nynne såmmå strofa i hattemakergrenn\, og morgendagen\, Salomo\, hva vet vel vi om den?  Refr.  Har Salomo sitt måltid med vin og fylte fat\, je sug på harde skorper og kæille det for mat\, men det vi gir ifrå øss di vi i lønndom går blir gras til hyrdens hvite lam og Sarons sorte får.  Refr.  Når dronningen av Saba gjør Salomo visitt\, je ser a "Lea Lettvint" og hu har tenkt seg hit. Om leiet blir forskjellig frå silkeseng tel strå\, vi går mot såmmå paradis og hører harper slå.  Refr.  Når sola synk og dale bak slottets tårn og tind\, så kjæm den mørke natta med drøm og tankespinn\, der blir je sjøl Kong Salomo og hæin blir kænskje den som står og svarver hatter uti hattemakergrenn.

COL title VAL Liebelei COL performer VAL Peter Kraus	COL video title VAL 1913 Massacre Ramblin' Jack Elliott COL description VAL 1913 Massacre American Folk Tales Ramblin' Jack Elliot  The 1913 Massacre is based on an event that took place just as the song says in Calumet\, Michigan on December 24\, 1913. It is always known as the Italian Hall Disaster. The strike that led up to this was one of the longest\, most dangerous strikes that took place in Michigan. The song refers to copper country which is the upper peninsula of Michigan.  The miners were striking for better pay\, shortened work days and safer working conditions. Worker's pay was based on the depth of penetration into the mines made by his group that day. The mine was switching to using a one man drill\, the mechanical drill cutting cost for the mines. However it broke up the family groups that worked in the mines together and cut many jobs. Most workers made around $2.75 a day for 10 - 12 hours a day.   The strike had been going on for 5 months. The striking miners and their families had gathered at the Italian Hall for a Christmas party. It is thought that there were five hundred people at the party. The building had a steep staircase and the party was being held on the second floor. There was a fire escape\, however as was common at the time\, it was poorly marked\, poorly lit\, and could only be reached by climbing through the window. Someone yelled "fire" and in the panic that followed 73 people were killed. Over half of the people killed were children between the ages of six and ten.  The investigations that followed produced no culprit. Part of the problem was victims who did not speak English were questioned and forced to answer in English. In other cases witnesses were not questioned at all. It was and still is commonly thought that out of town strike breakers\, funded by mine management\, were the ones that yelled fire.  The Italian Hall has since been demolished\, and only the archway remains from that day. A state historical markers marks the spot and date. COL channel name VAL leanannsidhe	0

COL title VAL One COL performer VAL Korn	COL video title VAL Mister Magic - Grover Washington\, Jr. (1974) COL description VAL "Mister Magic" was the successful single and title track from the fifth album of one of jazz music's more well-known figures.  Grover Washington\, Jr. (December 12\, 1943 -- December 17\, 1999) was an American jazz-funk / soul-jazz saxophonist.  Along with George Benson\, John Klemmer\, David Sanborn\, Bob James\, Chuck Mangione\, Herb Alpert\, and Spyro Gyra\, he is considered by many to be one of the founders of the smooth jazz genre.  He wrote some of his material and later became an arranger and producer.  Washington was born in Buffalo\, New York on December 12\, 1943.  His mother was a church chorister\, and his father was a collector of old jazz gramophone records and a saxophonist as well\, so music was everywhere in the home.  He grew up with the great jazzmen and big band leaders like Benny Goodman\, Fletcher Henderson\, and others like them.  At the age of 8\, with the desire for him to be more than he could be\, Grover Sr. gave Jr. a saxophone.  He practiced and would sneak into clubs to see famous Buffalo blues musicians.  Washington left Buffalo and played with a Midwest group called the Four Clefs.  He was drafted into the U.S. Army shortly thereafter\, but this was to be to his advantage\, as he met drummer Billy Cobham there.  Cobham\, a mainstay in New York City\, introduced Washington to many New York musicians.  After leaving the Army\, Washington freelanced his talents around New York City\, eventually landing in Philadelphia in 1967.  In 1970 and 1971\, he appeared on Leon Spencer's first two albums on Prestige Records\, together with Idris Muhammad and Melvin Sparks.  Washington's big break came at the expense of another artist.  Alto sax man Hank Crawford was unable to make a recording date with Creed Taylor's Kudu Records\, and Washington took his place\, even though he was a backup.  This led to his first solo album\, "Inner City Blues".  He was talented and displayed heart and soul with soprano\, alto\, tenor\, and baritone saxophones.  Refreshing for his time\, he made headway into the jazz mainstream.  His fifth album\, 1974's "Mister Magic"\, was a commercial success\, and introduced guitarist Eric Gale as a near-permanent member in Washington's arsenal.  Throughout the 1970s and 1980s\, Washington made some of the genre's most memorable hits\, including "Mr. Magic" and "Black Frost.  In addition\, he performed very frequently with other artists\, including Bill Withers on "Just The Two Of Us" (still in regular rotation on radio today)\, Patti LaBelle on "The Best Is Yet To Come" and Phyllis Hyman on "A Sacred Kind Of Love".  He is also remembered for his take on the Dave Brubeck classic "Take Five"\, and for his 1996 version of "Soulful Strut".  On December 17\, 1999\, while waiting in the green room after taping four songs for "The Saturday Early Show" at CBS Studios in New York City\, Washington collapsed.  He was taken to St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital\, where he was pronounced dead at about 7:30 p.m.  He was 56 years old.  His doctors determined that he had suffered a massive heart attack.

COL title VAL Till I Can't Take It Anymore COL performer VAL Neville Whitmill	COL video title VAL Maddox Brothers & Rose - No Help Wanted COL description VAL The Maddox Brothers and Rose\, known as America's Most Colorful Hillbilly Band from the 1930s to the 1950s\, consisted of four brothers\, Fred\, Cal\, Cliff and Don Maddox\, along with their sister Rose. Cliff died in 1949 and was replaced by brother Henry. The group disbanded in 1956.  The family hailed from Boaz\, Alabama\, but rode the rails and hitch hiked to California in 1933 when the band members were still children\, following the failed efforts of their sharecropper parents during the early part of the Depression. They were a little in advance of the flood of Okies who were to flood the state in the 30s. They struggled to make a living as intinerant fruit and vegetable pickers following the harvest as far north as Washington state\, and as far east as Arizona\, as well as in the San Joaquin Valley. They often worked from dawn to dusk\, sleeping and eating on the ground.  Having settled in Modesto\, the family developed their musical ability and\, in 1937 performed on the radio\, sponsored by a local furniture store. In 1939 they entered a hillbilly band competition at the centenial Sacramento State Fair after driving to Sacramento in their Model A. When they took the stage they tore through "Sally Let Your Bangs Hang Down" with rocking rhythms and risque lyrics. They became\, officially\, California's best hillbilly band.  The brothers and Rose appeared at places such as the 97th Street Corral in Los Angles.  From 1946-1951 the group recorded for 4 Star Records (Hollywood)\, then for Columbia Records. Some 4 Star masters were leased and released by US.-Decca Records at the beginning of the 1950s. The following quotes are from Rose Maddox. "We were called hillbilly singers - not country - then. No\, none of this country music then. People just called us hillbilly... People tell me that I was one of the first women to sing what I sang - country boogie. I guess I was. There was no rock 'n' roll in those early days\, before 1955. Only country boogie. My brothers also played that way. We called it country then.  The Maddox's material ranged from the country standards of Hank Williams and Merle Travis\, cowboy songs\, to the Western swing of Bob Wills\, to old-time\, folk\, and church singing\, to jazz\, swing\, boogie woogie and even a taste of early rock and roll.  Fred Maddox played upright bass using the "slap bass" technique as early as 1937.[5] This trademark backbeat\, a slapping bass style\, helped drive a broad change in popular music\, sporting a faster\, immediately discernible rhythm that came to be known as rockabilly.  Fred Maddox's bass is displayed at the Experience Music Project in Seattle. "They wanted his bass because they believe he might have hit the first note of rock 'n' roll on it.

She grew up with her parents and three siblings\, where it was her father who introduced her to the music when she was 10 years old. He was a musician himself. When she was 14\, her great love and Suzi Quatro became her great role model. The school's orchestra became her first gambling arena.  As an 18-year-old girl\, she began to sing and play professionally with a Bulgarian band. where they played around at the Black Sea tourist spots. She eventually got a lot of experience and got a job in a variety show.  Russia became the next venue. She also got to play for the Bulgarian president twice. In 1991 she came to Norway for the first time with "Smile Band". They played together for 15 years\, all over Norway and Europe. They had many great experiences together\, as when in 2001 she was singing and playing with one of her favorites\, Bonnie Taylor. She gave her a compliment\, which she will forever remember; “You sound more like me than I do”!   In 2003\, "Smile Band" broke up\, and Valentina started playing around as a troubadour. At Oset 2006\, she had the pleasure of meeting Bobby Bare. He invited her up on the stage and they sang and played together. It was a dream to stand in front of so many people singing. She also met Pam Tillis and Paul Young and the joy was also great when she got to play and sing along with Lynn Anderson In 2007 she released her first CD "Why not me". It sold over 16\,000 copies and the first gold plate was hung on the wall.  Now the second CD is finished\, "Comin` down the road"\, where Valentina is even stronger in her genre country-pop-rock. She has also included Stephen Ackles on a duet\, "To a tear becomes a rose"  #Valentina #QueenOfHearts# #CountryClassic #RonjasCountryMusic #RonjaGM COL channel name VAL RonjaGM	0

A piano version by Del Wood was the most successful charting at #4. The other versions charted at #17 (Champ Butler)\, #15 (Freddy Martin and his orchestra)\, #16 (Eddie Smith and the Chief)\, #22 (Lawrence Cook) and #26 (Frank Petty Trio). This song was a #1 hit for Ernest Hare and Billy Jones in 1921. Original Billboard review: "Carr turns in a real zingy coverage of the sleeper piano instrumental revival which has hit via Del Wood's reading on Tennessee label. Similar to the original and could catch a piece. Rated 81 out of 100".  Written by L. Wolfe Gilbert.   B-side is "Ivory Rag" by Joe "Fingers" Carr and the Carr-Hops.

COL title VAL Vehicle COL performer VAL Ac Rock	COL video title VAL Neil Diamond - Cherry Cherry (REMASTERED) COL description VAL Remastered by Figago - High Quality   Neil Leslie Diamond (born on January 24\, 1941) is an American singer-songwriter. As a successful pop music performer\, Diamond scored a number of hits worldwide in the 1960s\, 1970s\, and 1980s. According to David Wild\, common themes in Diamond's songs are "a deep sense of isolation and an equal desire for connection. A yearning for home -- and at the same time\, the allure of greater freedom. The good\, the bad and the ugly about a crazy little thing called love."  As of 2001 Diamond has 115 million records sold worldwide\, including 48 million records in the U.S. In terms of Billboard chart success\, he is the third most successful Adult Contemporary artist ever\, ranking behind only Barbra Streisand and Elton John.  Though his record sales declined somewhat after the 1980s\, Diamond continues to tour successfully\, and maintains a very loyal following. Diamond's songs have been recorded by a vast array of performers from many different musical genres.  Diamond was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1984\, and in 2000 received the Sammy Cahn Lifetime Achievement Award.  In 1966 Diamond signed a deal with Bert Berns's Bang Records label\, which was then a subsidiary company of Atlantic Records. His first release on that label\, "Solitary Man"\, was his first hit. Prior to the release of "Solitary Man\," Neil had considered using a stage name; he came up with two possible stage names\, "Noah Kaminsky"[citation needed] and "Eice Chary"[citation needed]. But when asked by Bang Records which name he was going to use\, Noah\, Eice\, or Neil\, he thought of his grandmother\, who died prior to the release of Solitary Man. Thus he told Bang Records\, "...go with Neil Diamond and I'll figure it out later." Diamond followed it with "Cherry\, Cherry"\, "Kentucky Woman"\, "Thank the Lord for the Night Time"\, "Do It\," and others. Diamond's Bang recordings were produced by legendary Brill Building songwriters Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich\, both of whom can be heard singing background on many of the tracks...

COL title VAL Just Dance COL performer VAL Scott Bradlee & Postmodern Jukebox	COL video title VAL Peggy Lee - He's My Guy COL description VAL Peggy Lee's alluring tone\, distinctive delivery\, breadth of material\, and ability to write many of her own songs made her one of the most captivating artists of the vocal era\, from her breakthrough on the Benny Goodman hit "Why Don't You Do Right" to her many solo successes\, singles including "Mañana\," "Lover" and "Fever" that showed her bewitching vocal power\, a balance between sultry swing and impeccable musicianship.  Born Norma Egstrom in Jamestown\, North Dakota\, she suffered the death of her mother at the age of four and endured a difficult stepmother after her father remarried. Given her sense of swing by listening to Count Basie on the radio\, she taught herself to sing and made her radio debut at the age of 14. She made the jump to Fargo (where she was christened Peggy Lee)\, then to Minneapolis and St. Louis to sing with a regional band. Lee twice journeyed to Hollywood to make her fortune\, but returned unsuccessful from both trips.  She finally got her big break in 1941\, when a vocal group she worked with began appearing at a club in Chicago. While there\, she was heard by Benny Goodman\, whose regular vocalist Helen Forrest was about to leave his band. Lee recorded with Goodman just a few days later\, debuting with the popular "Elmer's Tune" despite a good deal of nerves. That same year\, several songs became commercial successes including "I Got It Bad (And That Ain't Good)" and "Winter Weather." In 1943\, "Why Don't You Do Right" became her first major hit\, but she left the Goodman band (and the music industry altogether) later that year after marrying Goodman's guitarist\, Dave Barbour.  After just over a year of domestic life\, Peggy Lee returned to music\, first as part of an all-star jazz album. Then\, in late 1945\, Capitol signed her to a solo contract and she hit the charts with her first shot\, "Waitin' for the Train to Come In." Lee continued to score during the late '40s\, with over two dozen chart entries before the end of the decade\, including "It's a Good Day\," "Mañana (Is Soon Enough for Me)" -- the most popular song of 1948 -- and "I Don't Know Enough About You." Many of her singles were done in conjunction with Barbour\, her frequent writing and recording partner.  After moving to Decca in 1952\, Peggy Lee scored with the single "Lover" and an LP\, Songs From Pete Kelly's Blues recorded with Ella Fitzgerald (both singers also made appearances in the film). She spent only five years at Decca however\, before moving back to Capitol. There\, she distinguished herself through recording a wide variety of material\, including songs -- and occasionally\, entire LPs -- influenced by the blues\, Latin and cabaret as well as pop. Lee also used many different settings\, like an orchestra conducted by none other than Frank Sinatra for 1957's The Man I Love\, the George Shearing Quintet for 1959's live appearance Beauty and the Beat\, Quincey Jones as arranger and conductor for 1961's If You Go\, and arrangements by Benny Carter on 1963's Mink Jazz. Barbour's problems with alcoholism ended their marriage\, though they remained good friends until his death in 1965.  Peggy Lee was an early advocate of rock and made a quick transition into rock-oriented material. Given her depth and open mind for great songs no matter the source\, it wasn't much of a surprise that she sounded quite comfortable covering the more song-oriented end of late-'60s rock\, including great choices by Jimmy Webb\, Buffy Sainte-Marie\, Burt Bacharach\, Randy Newman\, Goffin & King and John Sebastian. She nearly brushed the Top Ten in 1969 with Leiber & Stoller's "Is That All There Is?" She continued recording contemporary material until 1972's Norma Deloris Egstrom From Jamestown\, North Dakota brought her back to her roots. It was her last LP for Capitol\, however. Lee recorded single LPs for Atlantic\, A&M\, Polydor UK and DRG before effectively retiring at the beginning of the 1980s. She returned in 1988 with two LPs for Music Masters that revisited her earlier successes. Her last album\, Moments Like This\, was recorded in 1992 for Chesky. Her voice was effectively silenced after a 1998 stroke\, and she died of a heart attack at her Bel Air home in early 2002. ~ John Bush\, All Music Guide  PLEASE NOTE:  I divided my uploads among multiple channels\,  Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

Performed by the Crazy World of Arthur Brown\, it was released as a single and on the band's debut album\, also called The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. The single made #1 in the UK (in August 1968) and Canada. In October\, it made #2 in the US Billboard charts and #19 in Australia. It also made number 6 in The Netherlands.  The song is an example of the psychedelic rock of the period\, though its lack of guitars distinguished it from many of its contemporaries. The lead instrument in this case was Vincent Crane's Hammond electronic organ\, augmented by an orchestral section featuring prominent brass. The singer's opening proclamation of himself as "the god of hellfire" became a lasting epithet.  *i posted this video only for entertainment purposes* COL channel name VAL elodd90	0

It was released on the band's fifth full-length studio album\, Document\, and also as a 7" vinyl single in 1987. The song was their first hit single\, reaching #9 in the US Billboard Hot 100\, #14 in Canada\, and later reached #16 in the UK singles chart on its UK release (1991).  The song was included in Activision's Guitar Hero World Tour and is in Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades.  The accompanying video's director was artist Robert Longo.  The director of photography was Alton Brown\, who later became a Food Network chef.  In March 2005\, Q magazine placed "The One I Love" at number 57 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks.  The song is included on R.E.M. Live.  Lyrics and meaning  Many listeners who misunderstand the song's meaning have made the song a popular radio dedication to loved ones\, relying on the main lyric\, "This one goes out to the one I love."  However\, they missed an ensuing line: "A simple prop to occupy my time"; the song was not particularly a love song.  Stipe related in 1987 to Rolling Stone\, "I've always left myself pretty open to interpretation. It's probably better that they just think it's a love song at this point."  However\, in an interview in the January 1988 issue of Musician magazine he said that the song was "incredibly violent" and "It's very clear that it's about using people over and over again".  The song contains only three verses\, which are all near identical\, with small variations each repeat of the verse. (For example "A simple prop to occupy my time"\, "Another prop has occupied my time"). The chorus consists of just the word "fire"\, repeated (with the backing vocal of "She's coming down on her own now/Coming down on her own"\, sung by Mike Mills).  Cover versions  Bush Sufjan Stevens Massacre and many more. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

COL title VAL I Hope That I Don't Fall in Love with You COL performer VAL Priscilla Herdman	COL video title VAL Bill Withers - Who Is He (And What Is He to You) COL description VAL Bill Withers - Who Is He (And What Is He to You)  William Harrison "Bill" Withers\, Jr. (born July 4\, 1938) is an American singer-songwriter and musician who performed and recorded from 1970 until 1985. Some of his best-known songs are "Lean on Me"\, "Ain't No Sunshine"\, "Use Me"\, "Just the Two of Us"\, "Lovely Day"\, and "Grandma's Hands". His life was recently the subject of the documentary film Still Bill. Withers was born the youngest of thirteen children in the small coal-mining town of Slab Fork\, West Virginia. Raised in nearby Beckley\, West Virginia\, Withers was thirteen years old when his father died. He enlisted with the United States Navy at age eighteen and served for nine years\, during which time he became interested in singing and writing songs. Soon after his discharge from the Navy in 1970\, he relocated to Los Angeles for a musical career. Withers worked as an assembler for several different companies\, including Douglas Aircraft Corporation\, while recording demo tapes with his own money\, shopping them around and performing in clubs at night. When he debuted with the song "Ain't No Sunshine" he refused to resign his job because of his belief that the music business was a fickle industry and that he was still a novice compared to other acts.  Lyrics  A man we passed just tried to stare me down  And when I looked at you\, you looked at the ground  I don't know who he is but I think that you do   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   I have something in my heart and in your eyes  Tell me he's not someone just passin' by  And when you cleared your throat was that your cue   Dag gummit dag  Who is he and what is he to you   Now when I add the sum of you and me  I get confused and I keep coming up with three  You're too much for one man but not enough for two   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Hey you tell me man don't have not much for intuition  That what you really think or are you wishin'  Before you wreck your old home be certain of the new   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you COL channel name VAL Alf	0

I was very impressed by her and she gave Gastonia a lot of recognition at the time of her record release. Her first song was "Please Don't Talk To The Lifeguard" and the song was continuously played on the radio with moderate success. There was a popular radio station 'WGAS" in Gastonia\, NC that played her album songs every hour on the hour to promote "The Exciting Years" and most of us had her album also.

Come a little bit closer\, you're my kind of man So big and so strong Come a little bit closer\, I'm all alone And the night is so long. Hmmmm. So we started to dance\, in my arms she felt so inviting Mmmmmm\, I just couldn't resist\, a-just a-one little kiss so exciting Then I heard the guitar player say\, va-moose\, Jose's on his way And I knew\, yes I knew\, I should run\, but then I heard her say. Come a little bit closer\, you're my kind of man So big and so strong Come a little bit closer\, I'm all alone And the night is so long. Ha\, ha\, ha\, alright. Laaa-laaa\, la-la\, laaa-laaa\, la-la Laaa-laaa\, la-la\, laaa-laaa\, la-la Then the music stopped\, when I looked\, the cafe was empty Then I heard Jose say\, man\, you know you're in trouble plenty So I dropped my drink from my hand\, and out through the window I ran And as I rode away\, I could hear her say to Jose. Come a little bit closer\, you're my kind of man So big and so strong Come a little bit closer\, I'm all alone And the night is so long. Come a little bit closer\, you're my kind of man So big and so strong Come a little bit closer\, I'm all alone And the night is so long.

This album is hard to find and commands a decent price tag but it was re-issued a few years ago and should now be available to a larger audience at last.  In my opinion Ellie Pop were treading their own path in 1968\, there's no fuzz\, no psych touches\, no 1968isms of heavy guitars and keyboards. What you get is a collection of beautifully constructed pop songs that suggest a big Anglophile influence\, in particular mid-60s period Beatles. They sound similar to say The Merry-Go-Round or The Left Banke but without the baroque touches. Just pure pop\, or should I say Ellie Pop.  Virtually every review I've read online or in Shindig for instance\, fails to mention that 'Whatcha Gonna Do 'Bout It' is a cover of a Hollies cut they recorded in 1963 for their debut album 'Stay With The Hollies.' Ellie Pop wrote all of their own tunes except this one!  I'm not certain where Ellie Pop hailed from or even the full names of the group members but it has been suggested elsewhere that they were from Detroit. Maybe someone can confirm this?  http://expo67-cavestones.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/ellie-pop-whatcha-gonna-do-bout-it.html COL channel name VAL ACID REVOLVER	1

Zijn nieuwe album "Jo Vally Zingt Country" dat in Oktober verscheen bleek een schot in de roos en is inmiddels haast goed voor goud. Het nieuwe jaar is nog kersvers maar het bracht al meteen goed nieuws\, Jo heeft een MIA-nominatie op zak in de categorie Vlaams Populair! Het wordt nu spannend afwachten voor hem tot 8 februari wanneer de prijzen van de prestigieuze awards zullen worden uitgedeeld. Voor Jo zelf voelt de nominatie an sich al als een persoonlijke overwinning\, een bevestiging dat hij met zijn Countryplaat de juiste weg is ingeslagen.  Na Jo's vorige single 'Calypso' werd het stilaan tijd voor een nieuwe single uit het nieuwe album en dat wordt "Geluk Kan Komen En Gaan". Het nummer wordt hiermee  Jo's nieuwe voorjaarssingle en blijkt onder de fans van Jo Vally één van de topfavorieten te zijn\, het houdt dan ook mooi het midden tussen de countrystijl en het eigen repertoire van Jo.  En net zoals voor de vorige singles werd ook voor dit nummer de clip in Hollywood geshoot\, ditmaal vormt een verlaten cowboydorp het decor.

Fools Fall In Love  ------------------------  "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" is a song by American punk rock band Green Day. It was released as the second single from their seventh album\, American Idiot. The song was written by Green Day\, with lyrics by lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong. The single peaked at number two in the United States\, making it Green Day's most successful song.  Influences and covers  Noel Gallagher of Oasis criticized Green Day in late 2006\, saying\, "They should have the decency to wait until I am dead [before stealing my songs]. I\, at least\, pay the people I steal from that courtesy"\, referencing the fact that "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" uses the same chord progression as Oasis's hit single "Wonderwall". Gallagher's reaction may have partly been due to the emergence of "Boulevard of Broken Songs"\, a popular mash-up mixed by San Francisco DJ and producer Party Ben in late 2004. The mix consisted of elements from "Boulevard of Broken Dreams"\, "Wonderwall"\, Travis' "Writing to Reach You" and Eminem's "Sing for the Moment"\, which itself has samples from Aerosmith's "Dream On" (another remix by Party Ben featured this\, "Wonderwall" and Kanye West's "Flashing Lights"). This song was covered by Japanese-American singer Hikaru Utada acoustically with a guitar during an internet broadcast in December 2005; a video of it can be found. "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" is sung first and then fades into "Passion" (After the Battle version) from the Kingdom Hearts II original soundtrack. "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" is also featured in the movie trailer of Lords of Dogtown (2005)\, starring Heath Ledger\, Emile Hirsch and John Robinson. Billie Joe Armstrong wrote the song while he was in his son Joey's bedroom.[citation needed] In the 2005 VH1 Storytellers program featuring Green Day\, Billie Joe Armstrong stated that the title of the song was "nicked" from the famous Gottfried Helnwein painting of the same title\, which features James Dean. Four earlier songs also have the same title: an old Harry Warren song\, a Hanoi Rocks song\, a Marianne Faithfull song\, and song by Brian Setzer from his 1986 album The Knife Feels Like Justice Lyrics from the song bear some resemblance to the Pinhead Gunpowder song "I Walk Alone"\, a band in which Billie Joe Armstrong also sings. It appeared on their 1997 album\, Goodbye Ellston Avenue. The song also shares some lyrics with the Whitesnake song "Here I Go Again"\, the words "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" can be found in the lyrics of the Elvis Costello song "Brilliant Mistake"\, the Allman Brothers Band song "End of the Line"\, the Deadsy song "The Key to Gramercy Park"\, and The Ataris song "Road Signs and Rock Songs". The phrase "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" also appears in punk/new wave band Blondie's 1982 minor UK-hit single Island of Lost Souls. A live version of the song can be found on Bullet in a Bible\, a live album of Green Day performing at the Milton Keynes National Bowl. Bluegrass band Cornbread Red did a cover of the song on a tribute album to Green Day Pickin' on Green Day\, while the German choir Gregorian did a cover\, on their Masters of Chant Chapter V album\, in the style of a Gregorian Chant. Mark Mallman covered this song on his MP3-only compilation release Outtakes Vol 1. The song is also featured in Green Day's musical American Idiot\, sung on the cast recording by John Gallagher Jr.\, Rebecca Naomi Jones\, and the rest of the company.

You don't often hear a vocal version of this song. This was Billy's penultimate chart entry\, the last being "Goodnight\, Irene" (#75 in April 1959). It was a #3 hit for Vincent Lopez and His Orchestra in July 1922 (I've also posted this version). Also #9 for Les Paul in June 1950 (which I've posted too)\, Original Billboard review: "An ingratiating chanting stint by Williams marks this updated version of the evergreen. The lyrics are cute and the artist is at his best. Spins should please."   Written by Felix Arndt and Sunny Skylar.   B-side is "Tied to the Strings of Your Heart". COL channel name VAL CatsPjamas1	0

She Drives Me Crazy (Written-By - Fine Young Cannibals)  ------------------------  She Drives Me Crazy" is a song recorded by the Fine Young Cannibals\, included on their 1989 album The Raw and the Cooked. The song peaked at #5 as a single in the band's native UK in January 1989 (it was released on New Year's Day) before hitting #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S. on 15 April 1989. It appeared on The Raw and Cooked album the following month.  It also made number 3 on the Dutch Top 40. A remixed version was released in 1997.  The unique snare drum "pop" sound was created by recording the snare drum portion separately. A speaker was then placed on top of the snare drum\, and a microphone below. The original recording of the snare drum part was played back through the speaker and re-recorded.  Music video  Two music videos were produced for the song\, one by Philippe Decouflé and one by Pedro Romhanyi. Similar to Decouflé's only other music video\, New Order's "True Faith"\, his version includes extensive choreography and performers in unusual costumes\, including two identical dancers with completely different coloured-outfits\, as well as a person with a television on their head. This version received several nominations at the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards\, including Best Video. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

She speaks fluently Spanish\, English and Italian. Due to her great voice\, she has been compared to famous international singers\, to Whitney Houston above all. Session vocalist for various Dance productions in the 90's\, she's been performing a lot around the World and has taken part in many TV shows in Italy. She's also an author: she wrote for Mario Biondi on the albums 'Handful of soul' and 'I love you more'\, she co-wrote most of the songs on the Papik album 'Rhythm of life'\, together with her producer Nerio Poggi (aka Papik)\, including 'Staying for Good'\, the single from the album that's getting a great response worldwide. This is her first album under her own name and it's dedicated to remakes in a soul-jazz style of tunes from the 80's and 90's. Among the songs chosen: a bossa cover of 'Rhythm of the night' by Corona and an R&B version of 'Barbie Girl'. But the self-penned '1986' is the real gem on this album!

Tudo dará certo sha na na na na na.... Sha na na na na na na na... Agora simplesmente me abrace forte  Cante para mim mamãe (mama mama ma) Cante isso doce e claro\, oh! Mamãe me deixa ouvir aquela velha canção rock and roll  Nós fizemos isto nos dias solitários Mas\, Deus\, as noites eram longas ! E nós sonharíamos com momentos melhores Quando a mamãe cantou a canção dela Agora eu não posso recordar as palavras de forma alguma Não faz sentido tentar Porque eu simplesmente soube que muito amor veio através Daquela canção rock and roll  E ela iria cantar sha na na na nana Vai dar tudo certo Sha na na na nana Agora apenas segure firme  Eu posso ouvir você mama (mama mama ma) nada afrouxa minha alma como o som da canção de ninar bom velho rock and roll.

COL title VAL Just One Smile COL performer VAL The Tokens	COL video title VAL Joe "Fingers" Carr - Down Yonder (1951) COL description VAL Charted at #14 on Billboard in December 1951. 6 other versions of this song also charted in 1951! A piano version by Del Wood was the most successful charting at #4. The other versions charted at #17 (Champ Butler)\, #15 (Freddy Martin and his orchestra)\, #16 (Eddie Smith and the Chief)\, #22 (Lawrence Cook) and #26 (Frank Petty Trio). This song was a #1 hit for Ernest Hare and Billy Jones in 1921. Original Billboard review: "Carr turns in a real zingy coverage of the sleeper piano instrumental revival which has hit via Del Wood's reading on Tennessee label. Similar to the original and could catch a piece. Rated 81 out of 100".  Written by L. Wolfe Gilbert.   B-side is "Ivory Rag" by Joe "Fingers" Carr and the Carr-Hops.

COL title VAL The Jealous Kind COL performer VAL Etta Britt	COL video title VAL Rudy A Message To You - The Locomotive (1967) COL description VAL Locomotive formed in Birmingham\, England originally as a jazz band and by the mid 60s they were taking great influence from early ska music brought to the city by Jamaicans who were finding work in the industrial heartland of Britain.   Although there were other white musicians dabbling in Jamaican Ska in the early 60s\, Locomotive were possibly the earliest British band to experiment with Ska in an authentic way\, and as a white 'band' were probably quite ahead of their time considering they made it to vinyl.    While Brumbeat bands and artists such as 'Spencer Davis Group'\, 'The Move' and 'Robert Plant' were mimicking the blues of black America\, Locomotive were looking more to the West Indies for their inspiration\, which\, today\, could be considered a short-cut to a cooler sound than black American blues\, which by this time had taken a step in a completely different direction "heavy metal".  Locomotive's later styles included Soul\, Psychedelia and a fade into the prog rock era with Norman Haines eventually going it alone.  This is the first cover of Dandy Livingstone's "Rudy A Message To You"\, recorded in the same year as the original in late 1967 and is B-Side to "Broken Heart" on the Direction label. It was recorded over a decade before the seminal Specials version.   There were several notable band members such as Chris Wood who went on to join supergroup 'Traffic'\,  Mike Kellie of 'Spooky Tooth' and Bob Lamb who was the producer for 70s dub reggae band 'UB40'.

Come a little bit closer\, you're my kind of man So big and so strong Come a little bit closer\, I'm all alone And the night is so long. Hmmmm. So we started to dance\, in my arms she felt so inviting Mmmmmm\, I just couldn't resist\, a-just a-one little kiss so exciting Then I heard the guitar player say\, va-moose\, Jose's on his way And I knew\, yes I knew\, I should run\, but then I heard her say. Come a little bit closer\, you're my kind of man So big and so strong Come a little bit closer\, I'm all alone And the night is so long. Ha\, ha\, ha\, alright. Laaa-laaa\, la-la\, laaa-laaa\, la-la Laaa-laaa\, la-la\, laaa-laaa\, la-la Then the music stopped\, when I looked\, the cafe was empty Then I heard Jose say\, man\, you know you're in trouble plenty So I dropped my drink from my hand\, and out through the window I ran And as I rode away\, I could hear her say to Jose. Come a little bit closer\, you're my kind of man So big and so strong Come a little bit closer\, I'm all alone And the night is so long. Come a little bit closer\, you're my kind of man So big and so strong Come a little bit closer\, I'm all alone And the night is so long.

Buy your SIGNED copy here: http://stix-shop.dk/ More info: http://www.pasborg.dk/  ''Stefan Pasborg is yet another Nordic artist gradually raising his profile across international borders as he leads his new five-piece outfit around Europe.... Most pieces exploited the players' individual virtuosity\, but in principle the writing for the group emphasized collectivity rather than individuality\, always knitted tightly by Pasborg's strong drumming.... Odessa 5 is certainly a band to be blown away by''  - All About Jazz\, USA.   Stefan Pasborg's band Odessa ''X-tra Large'' features some of the finest musicians on the Nordic jazz scenes. Musicians that aren't afraid to cross new musical land. Together they play some seriously exiting multi-jazz. The bodily and the imagination is the main focus\, and you have to travel all the way back in time to Charles Mingus to find the same kind of energy. There is not so much more to say other than when the musicians are having fun\, as they so obviously have in this case\, then the listener has as well. COL channel name VAL copentube	0

In her three-decade long career as a solo artist\, Made in Brazil results from the first time she’s recorded a disc in her native Brazil since moving to the United States in 1981. (International release dates may vary)  Elias wears many hats on this project as producer\, composer\, lyricist\, arranger\, pianist and vocalist. “I am completely immersed and involved in every single detail of the music and the recording process\, from the birth of an idea until its completion through every aspect of the production until it reaches the public\,” she explains.  Along with co-producers\, Steve Rodby and Marc Johnson\, her bass playing musical partner\, Elias ventured ‘home’ and recruited a splendid cast of Brazilian musicians that include electric bassist Marcelo Mariano; guitarists Marcus Teixeira and Roberto Menescal; drummers Edu Ribeiro and Rafael Barata; and percussionists Mauro Refosco and Marivaldo dos Santos.  Elias peppered the sessions with delightful special guest performances from Mark Kibble and the multi-GRAMMY® Award-winning gospel vocal group Take 6; her singer/songwriter-daughter Amanda Brecker; one of Brazil’s most celebrated R&B stars\, Ed Motta; and the distinguished bossa nova composer Roberto Menescal.  Elias also invited Rob Mathes to handle orchestral arrangements on seven of the 12 tracks\, which were recorded in London at the legendary Abbey Road Studios. “It’s so touching to hear the music unfold\,” she says of the orchestral arrangements after they were overdubbed onto the São Paulo sessions. “You can see the musical notes on paper\, but it’s something else to hear them realized and performed by members of the London Symphonic Orchestra.” COL channel name VAL Concord Records	0

COL title VAL De partizane COL performer VAL Yasmine en Thé Lau	COL video title VAL The Charlie Daniels Band - Pride And Joy.wmv COL description VAL Tailgate Party This CD contains some of the greatest rock songs of all time. Originally made legendary by some of the south's best rock bands\, Charlie adds his own unique sound to each song. Originals\, live and studio versions make this collection live up to its' name by being a great one to pull out during a "Tailgate Party."   Description      13 Tracks previously released in 1999     Engineered\, Produced and Mixed by: Ron W. Griffin     Executive Producer: David Corlew  Guide Review - Charlie Daniels Band - Tailgate Party  Included on this very southern rock flavored collection are live versions of "The Legend of Wooley Swamp" and "The Devil Went Down to Georgia." With both songs being so well known and played a gazillion times\, it was refreshing to hear them live and just slightly different from what we are normally accustomed to.  "The South's Gonna Do It Again" had an added bonus to it by having a very early on in his career performance by Keith Urban\, showing us some very impressive guitar solo's. Remakes of ZZ Top's "Sharp Dressed Man" and Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Freebird" were very captivating and showed off some incredible fiddle playing by Charlie. Probably one of my most favorites was CDB's remake of the song made famous by Hootie and the Blowfish\, "Let Her Cry." Charlie has always been well known for his playing but under rated for his vocals. This song shows off just how well he can deliver some very heartfelt emotions and I really enjoyed listening to this new version.  If you have ever appreciated CDB\, you will really like this release. If for nothing else\, the diversity of the genre's and CDB being able to add the country sound without destroying the memory of the song.

COL title VAL Breathless COL performer VAL Wanda Jackson	COL video title VAL Mister Magic - Grover Washington\, Jr. (1974) COL description VAL "Mister Magic" was the successful single and title track from the fifth album of one of jazz music's more well-known figures.  Grover Washington\, Jr. (December 12\, 1943 -- December 17\, 1999) was an American jazz-funk / soul-jazz saxophonist.  Along with George Benson\, John Klemmer\, David Sanborn\, Bob James\, Chuck Mangione\, Herb Alpert\, and Spyro Gyra\, he is considered by many to be one of the founders of the smooth jazz genre.  He wrote some of his material and later became an arranger and producer.  Washington was born in Buffalo\, New York on December 12\, 1943.  His mother was a church chorister\, and his father was a collector of old jazz gramophone records and a saxophonist as well\, so music was everywhere in the home.  He grew up with the great jazzmen and big band leaders like Benny Goodman\, Fletcher Henderson\, and others like them.  At the age of 8\, with the desire for him to be more than he could be\, Grover Sr. gave Jr. a saxophone.  He practiced and would sneak into clubs to see famous Buffalo blues musicians.  Washington left Buffalo and played with a Midwest group called the Four Clefs.  He was drafted into the U.S. Army shortly thereafter\, but this was to be to his advantage\, as he met drummer Billy Cobham there.  Cobham\, a mainstay in New York City\, introduced Washington to many New York musicians.  After leaving the Army\, Washington freelanced his talents around New York City\, eventually landing in Philadelphia in 1967.  In 1970 and 1971\, he appeared on Leon Spencer's first two albums on Prestige Records\, together with Idris Muhammad and Melvin Sparks.  Washington's big break came at the expense of another artist.  Alto sax man Hank Crawford was unable to make a recording date with Creed Taylor's Kudu Records\, and Washington took his place\, even though he was a backup.  This led to his first solo album\, "Inner City Blues".  He was talented and displayed heart and soul with soprano\, alto\, tenor\, and baritone saxophones.  Refreshing for his time\, he made headway into the jazz mainstream.  His fifth album\, 1974's "Mister Magic"\, was a commercial success\, and introduced guitarist Eric Gale as a near-permanent member in Washington's arsenal.  Throughout the 1970s and 1980s\, Washington made some of the genre's most memorable hits\, including "Mr. Magic" and "Black Frost.  In addition\, he performed very frequently with other artists\, including Bill Withers on "Just The Two Of Us" (still in regular rotation on radio today)\, Patti LaBelle on "The Best Is Yet To Come" and Phyllis Hyman on "A Sacred Kind Of Love".  He is also remembered for his take on the Dave Brubeck classic "Take Five"\, and for his 1996 version of "Soulful Strut".  On December 17\, 1999\, while waiting in the green room after taping four songs for "The Saturday Early Show" at CBS Studios in New York City\, Washington collapsed.  He was taken to St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital\, where he was pronounced dead at about 7:30 p.m.  He was 56 years old.  His doctors determined that he had suffered a massive heart attack.

COL title VAL My Heart Skips a Beat COL performer VAL Dwight Yoakam	COL video title VAL The Crazy World of Arthur Brown-Fire  (1968) COL description VAL "Fire" is a 1968 song by Arthur Brown\, Vincent Crane\, Mike Finesilver and Peter Ker. Performed by the Crazy World of Arthur Brown\, it was released as a single and on the band's debut album\, also called The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. The single made #1 in the UK (in August 1968) and Canada. In October\, it made #2 in the US Billboard charts and #19 in Australia. It also made number 6 in The Netherlands.  The song is an example of the psychedelic rock of the period\, though its lack of guitars distinguished it from many of its contemporaries. The lead instrument in this case was Vincent Crane's Hammond electronic organ\, augmented by an orchestral section featuring prominent brass. The singer's opening proclamation of himself as "the god of hellfire" became a lasting epithet.  *i posted this video only for entertainment purposes* COL channel name VAL elodd90	0

COL description VAL 118 years ago to this date\, an event would transpire that would serve as the basis for the murder ballad Duncan and Brady that is still commonly played to this day. On October 6\, 1880\, Patrolman James Brady was shot and killed at the Charles Starkes Saloon in downtown Saint Louis\, Missouri. A man by the name of Harry Duncan would be arrested\, convicted and executed for the crime.  The prevailing legend is that the crime was something of a reaction to police harassment of African-Americans in the area\, which at the time was the "red light" district of Saint Louis. It all started with a simple brawl at the saloon that exploded into gunfire when police arrived on the scene and tried to take suspects into custody. Brady was hit in the hail of bullets and would die from his wounds. COL channel name VAL David Albion	0

Arranged by  Capps and produced by Joseph Porter.  Joanie\, who scored a #7 US hit with “Johnny Get Angry” in the summer of 1962\, didn’t return to Hot-100 after “When The Boys Get Together” charted in October of the same year.  Some great records followed on Warners\, however\, including the northern soul favorite\, “Don’t Pity Me” in 1965. By 1967\, Joanie was with Columbia and following year with Capitol but still the hits continued to elude her – notwithstanding the quality of her recordings.  “Step Inside Love” had been a #8 UK hit for Cilla Black during Cilla’s ten year chart run from the early 60s.  The Happy Tiger label was owned by the Flying Tiger Line\, an air freight company. The label ran from 1968-71 and was home to artists such as Donnie Brooks\, Priscilla Paris and Them.

COL title VAL Bring Me Sunshine COL performer VAL The Jive Aces featuring Toni Elizabeth Prima	COL video title VAL Nancy Sinatra & Lee Hazlewood: Some Velvet Morning COL description VAL The second song I ever really loved.   I have loved & lived with this song all my life and it is one of my favourite top 10 tracks of all time.   Track Meaning:  One day when the male character in the song is sober and has his head "straight"\, he will impart something of significance to his current love about his earliest & deepest love\, a woman named "pheadra" whose memory he is still haunted by.  Hence the repetition of the Pheadra/ Nancy portion of the song . . .  her section symbolising the "haunting" and struggle inside his head as he tries to gain "closure" from this past relationship with a mysterious former love Pheadra . . . his part of the song being directed to his new lover in the present.    His present lack of sobriety (drunkeness) describing his vain attempts to drown out the all consuming memory of this mysterious former love\, a memory that he is aware is annoying his present lover and describes his fear that she may leave him as a result of his "haunting" by his old (first)love.  Note:  At the point in history this song was written the labels of "straight" (meaning hetrosexual) and "gay" (meaning homosexual) did not yet exist.  In fact by the late sixties the term "gay" was just another word for "happy". COL channel name VAL calicomoonchild	0

COL title VAL Rather Be COL performer VAL Brooklyn Duo	COL video title VAL Marty Robbins Sings 'A Tree In The Meadow.'

The song became a number 1 in the States for Margaret Whiting in 1948 staying on the chart for 23 weeks. This version by Marty comes from his 1977 album 'Don't Let Me Touch You.' Other singers to have recorded the song include Al Jolson\, Frank Sinatra and Connie Francis. Regarding Reid's songs 'The Gypsy' and 'A Tree In The Meadow'\, it's a pity that songs like this don't seem to get written nowadays. It seems that melody\, lyric and romance have all gone out the window in this day and age. Pity. COL channel name VAL tarquin45	0

Se unió a su primera banda profesional\,  The Carolina Stompers\, en 1929. Entre los años 1930 y 1940 pasó varios años en las bandas de Lucky Millinder y Count Basie además de pasar largos períodos como músico independiente\, tanto de intérprete como de arreglista. Después de la Segunda Guerra Mundial \, dirigió a sus propios grupos\, centránsodose  en el rhythm and blues y en  el jazz.  Su éxito más grande de R & B hit fue " Because of You "\, que alcanzó el número 1 en la EE.UU.  y el número 20 en la lista pop \, en 1951. "Because of You" fue hecho para el United Records \, un sello para el que Smith escribió prolíficamente hasta su cierre en 1957. Tab Smith grabó para esta compañia 24 Eps y un disco de 10 pulgadas.  Durante la década de 1950\, Smith etocó el  saxofón alto en la  orquesta de Earl Bostic.  Su carrera nunca se recuperó del cierre de United records.

Alex Goot) Lyrics COL description VAL LYRICS :   Now that she's back in the atmosphere With drops of Jupiter in her hair\, hey She acts like summer and walks like rain Reminds me that there's a time to change\, hey Since the return from her stay on the moon She listens like spring and she talks like June\, hey\, hey   But tell me\, did you sail across the sun? Did you make it to the Milky Way To see the lights all faded And that heaven is overrated?  Tell me\, did you fall for a shooting star? One without a permanent scar And then you missed me While you were looking for yourself out there?   Now that she's back from that soul vacation Tracing her way through the constellation\, hey She checks out Mozart while she does Tae-Bo Reminds me that there's room to grow\, hey   Now that she's back in the atmosphere I'm afraid that she might think of me as Plain ol' Jane told a story about a man Who was too afraid to fly so he never did land   But tell me\, did the wind sweep you off your feet? Did you finally get the chance To dance along the light of day And head back to the Milky Way?  And tell me\, did Venus blow your mind? Was it everything you wanted to find? And then you missed me While you were looking for yourself out there   Can you imagine no love\, pride\, deep-fried chicken Your best friend always sticking up for you Even when I know you're wrong?  Can you imagine no first dance\, freeze-dried romance Five-hour phone conversation The best soy latte that you ever had\, and me?   But tell me\, did the wind sweep you off your feet? Did you finally get the chance To dance along the light of day And head back toward the Milky Way?   But tell me\, did you sail across the sun? Did you make it to the Milky Way To see the lights all faded And that heaven is overrated?  And tell me\, did you fall for a shooting star? One without a permanent scar And then you missed me While you were looking for yourself? COL channel name VAL chadli sandag	0

A real "Jazz Oddity" - Federica Zammarchi "Jazz Oddity"\, consists in eleven re-arrangements of songs of David Bowie. Its concept came up a few years ago\, when she needed to mix together her two main musical loves\, namely jazz and 70's rock\, both so important during her forming years. It was recorded with an Italian all- star band and it showcases a uniquely innovative sound\, slightly influenced by european bands like the Esbjörn Svensson Trio\, coining a new genre definition called "PowerJazz".

Zijn nieuwe album "Jo Vally Zingt Country" dat in Oktober verscheen bleek een schot in de roos en is inmiddels haast goed voor goud. Het nieuwe jaar is nog kersvers maar het bracht al meteen goed nieuws\, Jo heeft een MIA-nominatie op zak in de categorie Vlaams Populair! Het wordt nu spannend afwachten voor hem tot 8 februari wanneer de prijzen van de prestigieuze awards zullen worden uitgedeeld. Voor Jo zelf voelt de nominatie an sich al als een persoonlijke overwinning\, een bevestiging dat hij met zijn Countryplaat de juiste weg is ingeslagen.  Na Jo's vorige single 'Calypso' werd het stilaan tijd voor een nieuwe single uit het nieuwe album en dat wordt "Geluk Kan Komen En Gaan". Het nummer wordt hiermee  Jo's nieuwe voorjaarssingle en blijkt onder de fans van Jo Vally één van de topfavorieten te zijn\, het houdt dan ook mooi het midden tussen de countrystijl en het eigen repertoire van Jo.  En net zoals voor de vorige singles werd ook voor dit nummer de clip in Hollywood geshoot\, ditmaal vormt een verlaten cowboydorp het decor.

Original Billboard review: "Here's a sock performance by Kay Starr on a powerful dramatic ballad\, based on "Autumn Concerto". Lush\, big band backing is in keeping with sweeping effect of platter. Should pull plenty of jockey spins\, and could put gal back on charts."  Written by Camillo Bargoni\, Al Stillman & Paul Siegel.   B-side is "Flim Flam Flou". COL channel name VAL CatsPjamas1	0

Banes Drums\, Percussion -- Jimmy Young  ------------------------  "Fire" is a 1968 song by Arthur Brown\, Vincent Crane\, Mike Finesilver and Peter Ker. Performed by The Crazy World of Arthur Brown\, it was released as a single and on the band's debut album\, also called The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. The single made #1 in the UK (in August 1968) and Canada. In October\, it made #2 in the US Billboard charts and #19 in Australia. It also made #6 in the Netherlands. "Fire" sold over one million copies\, and was awarded a gold disc.  The song is an example of the psychedelic rock of the period\, though its lack of guitars or bass guitar distinguished it from many of its contemporaries. The lead instrument in this case was Vincent Crane's Hammond electronic organ\, augmented by an orchestral section featuring prominent brass. The singer's opening proclamation of himself as "the god of hellfire" became a lasting epithet. The song's other memorable line is "You're Gonna Burn!!". The song ends with the sound of a wind from hell.  During live performances and in the black and white promotional television clip\, Brown performed the song wearing a burning helmet. The helmet was improvised with a leather skull cap onto which was bolted a metal dish that held lighter fluid or petrol. As the cap was not insulated\, the heat from the burning fuel quickly conducted through the fixing bolt to the top of Brown's head\, causing him considerable pain.  Two studio mixes of "Fire" have been officially released\, one in stereo and one in mono. The mono mix features no brass. Both versions are included on the CD reissue of The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. The single B-side\, "Rest Cure"\, was another track from the album.  Credit for the composition of "Fire" on the original vinyl single was to Arthur Brown and Vincent Crane only; however\, Mike Finesilver and Peter Ker successfully sued for co-credit and royalties based on melodic similarities to their song "Baby\, You're a Long Way Behind".  The song is briefly featured in the films Hot Fuzz (2007) and The Boat That Rocked (2009). It is also referenced in Julie Hearn's debut novel Follow Me Down\, and was used in the episode "Burn Victim" of My Name Is Earl.  Cover versions  The Ventures covered the song on their 1969 album Underground Fire. Lizzy Mercier Descloux covered "Fire" on her album Press Color (1979)\, drastically changing the mood and style of the track. Pete Townshend\, the single's associate producer\, covered "Fire" as a member of The Who on his 1989 album The Iron Man: A Musical. Cirith Ungol covered the song on their 1991 album Paradise Lost. The Prodigy sampled the track for "Fire/Jericho"\, which was otherwise a completely different song\, on their 1992 album Experience. Emerson\, Lake & Palmer covered the song on their 1993 4-disc compilation album The Return of the Manticore. German dark electro act AmGod covered the song several times. The most well-known version is "Fire v.2" featured on the 1994 album Half Rotten and Decayed. Though it was not a true 'cover'\, Marilyn Manson's "Lunchbox" (1995) heavily samples "Fire". UK doom metal band Cathedral covered the song on their 1996 EP Hopkins (The Witchfinder General). Die Krupps covered the song on their 1997 album Paradise Now. Dutch death metal band God Dethroned covered the song on their 1997 album The Grand Grimoire. Ozzy Osbourne included a version on his 2005 album Under Cover. The song is used in one episode of Series 3 of Monkey Dust (2005) as the Paedofinder General burns the wrongly accused paedophiles with this music in the background\, complete with bastardised lyrics. US Hip hop duo Cunninlynguists sampled the song for "Hellfire" on their 2006 album A Piece of Strange. Leningrad Cowboys covered the song in a metal style and included it on their 2006 album Zombie's Paradise. Appears in the musical Disco Inferno\, when the character Duke reveals himself to be Satan in disguise.[citation needed] Death Grips\, an experimental hip hop group backed by drummer Zach Hill\, sampled "Fire" in their song "Lord of the Game".

Cale\, Snuff Garrett  This was a Snuff Garrett project as a compilation album of covers of numbers that were popular on Hollywood's Sunset Strip. These were combined with newly-written numbers by J.J. Cale who was a member of the makeshift group assembled for the recording\, who called themselves "The Leathercoated Minds".  ------------------------  "Along Comes Mary" is a song composed by Tandyn Almer\, originally recorded in 1966 by American sunshine pop band the Association. It was the group's first hit\, released on their debut album\, And Then... Along Comes the Association (1966).  Background  "Along Comes Mary" is sung from the point of view of a once-disillusioned young man talking about the "tribulations no one ever sees" and who "curse[s] those faults in me." The singer believes Mary gives him comfort and improves his life. An acquaintance of Almer claimed in an interview that "Mary" refers to marijuana\, though it is unclear if Almer ever confirmed this. In the Young People's Concert titled What Is a Mode? Leonard Bernstein explained that the song was composed in the Dorian mode.  Bloodhound Gang version  American rock band Bloodhound Gang recorded a version of "Along Comes Mary" with new punk music to accompany the lyrics. It first appeared on the 1998 soundtrack to the film Half Baked before appearing on Bloodhound Gang's third studio album\, Hooray for Boobies\, the following year. "Along Comes Mary" was released as the album's first single in May 1999 and reached No. 5 in Austria\, No. 6 in Germany\, and No. 13 in Switzerland. The song was certified gold in both Austria and Germany.  Other covers  In 1966\, Hugh Masekela included the song on his album Hugh Masekela's Next Album\, and in 1967\, Cal Tjader covered it for his album Along Comes Cal. That same year\, Baja Marimba Band's had a minor hit with their cover of the song.  In 1968\, George Benson included a version on his album Giblet Gravy\, and in 1986 a cover appeared on R. Stevie Moore's album Glad Music.  In 1995\, the Manhattan Transfer covered the song for their album Tonin'\, and the following year\, 24-7 Spyz covered it for their album 6.  In 2005\, a cover of the song appeared on the Guess Who's compilation album Let's Go\, and Plainsong also released a cover on their self-titled album.  ------------------------  Lyrics  Every time I think that I'm the only one who's lonely someone calls on me. And every now and then I spend my time in rhyme and verse and curse those faults in me.  And then along comes Mary And does she want to give me kicks\, and be my steady chick and give me pick of memories Or maybe rather gather tales of all the fails and tribulations no one ever sees.  When we met I was sure out to lunch Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch.  When vague desire is the fire in the eyes of chicks whose sickness is the games they play. And when the masquerade is played and neighbor folks make jokes as who is most to blame today.  And then along comes Mary And does she want to set them free\, and let them see reality from where she got her name. And will they struggle much when told that such a tender touch as hers will make them not the same.  When we met I was sure out to lunch Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch\, sweet as the punch\, sweet as the punch\, sweet as the punch\, sweet as the punch.

COL title VAL Out of My Dreams COL performer VAL Jack Pleis and His Orchestra	COL video title VAL Bill Keith Homestead on The Farm COL description VAL William Bradford Keith was born in Boston\, Massachusetts. He attended Amherst College and graduated in 1961. In 1963 he became a member of Bill Monroe's Bluegrass Boys.   Keith's recordings and performances during these nine months with Monroe permanently altered banjo playing\, and his style has become an important part of the playing styles of many banjoists. After leaving the Bluegrass Boys\, he joined "Jim Kweskin Jug Band" playing plectrum banjo. He began playing the steel guitar and soon after 1968\, found himself working together with Ian and Sylvia and Jonathan Edwards. In the 1970s Keith recorded for Rounder Records. Over the years he has performed with several other musicians\, such as Clarence White and David Grisman in Muleskinner\, Tony Trischka\, Jim Rooney and Jim Collier. Today\, Keith style is still regarded as modern or progressive in the context of bluegrass banjo playing.    Keith made a mechanical contribution to the banjo\, as well. He designed a specialized type of banjo tuning peg that facilitates changing quickly from one open tuning to another\, while playing. Earlier famed banjoist Earl Scruggs had designed a set of cams which were added to the banjo to perform this task. Keith's invention made the extra hardware unnecessary\, replacing two of the tuning machines already on the banjo — a more elegant solution. Scruggs himself became a partner in the venture for a while\, and the product was known as "Scruggs-Keith Pegs". Known today simply as Keith Pegs\, they remain the state of the art\, and Bill Keith continues to manufacture and market them personally as the primary product of his own company\, the Beacon Banjo Company.

COL title VAL Part Time Lover COL performer VAL Tanya Stephens	COL video title VAL Wayne King & His Orchestra - Goofus (1930) COL description VAL Wayne King\, born Harold Wayne King\, (February 16\, 1901  July 16\, 1985) was an American musician\, songwriter\, singer and orchestral leader. He was sometimes referred to as "the Waltz King" because most of his popular music involved waltzes; "The Waltz You Saved For Me" was his Theme Song. Born in Savanna\, Illinois\, King was an impressive athlete in high school\, and briefly played professional football with the Canton Bulldogs. He also attended Valparaiso University in Indiana for two years\, but left to begin a career in music. After playing saxophone for the Paul Whiteman Orchestra\, he created "Wayne King and Orchestra" in 1927. King's innovations included converting Carrie Jacobs-Bond's "I Love You Truly" from its original 2/4 time over to 3/4. The orchestra disbanded during World War II\, and King joined the army\, advancing to the rank of major. The orchestra was reestablished in 1946. King's orchestra had a television show in Chicago from 1949 to 1952. He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the Radio category.  In later years he operated a Black Angus cattle farm and a car rental business. In early 1958 he appeared as a guest challenger on the TV panel show "To Tell The Truth". He released a Christmas album on Decca Records\, Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\, in 1963. King's orchestra played its last engagement in March 1983 at the Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall in Sarasota\, Florida. COL channel name VAL ASACurator	0

COL title VAL Your Old Love Letters COL performer VAL Faron Young	COL video title VAL Neil Diamond - Cherry Cherry (REMASTERED) COL description VAL Remastered by Figago - High Quality   Neil Leslie Diamond (born on January 24\, 1941) is an American singer-songwriter. As a successful pop music performer\, Diamond scored a number of hits worldwide in the 1960s\, 1970s\, and 1980s. According to David Wild\, common themes in Diamond's songs are "a deep sense of isolation and an equal desire for connection. A yearning for home -- and at the same time\, the allure of greater freedom. The good\, the bad and the ugly about a crazy little thing called love."  As of 2001 Diamond has 115 million records sold worldwide\, including 48 million records in the U.S. In terms of Billboard chart success\, he is the third most successful Adult Contemporary artist ever\, ranking behind only Barbra Streisand and Elton John.  Though his record sales declined somewhat after the 1980s\, Diamond continues to tour successfully\, and maintains a very loyal following. Diamond's songs have been recorded by a vast array of performers from many different musical genres.  Diamond was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1984\, and in 2000 received the Sammy Cahn Lifetime Achievement Award.  In 1966 Diamond signed a deal with Bert Berns's Bang Records label\, which was then a subsidiary company of Atlantic Records. His first release on that label\, "Solitary Man"\, was his first hit. Prior to the release of "Solitary Man\," Neil had considered using a stage name; he came up with two possible stage names\, "Noah Kaminsky"[citation needed] and "Eice Chary"[citation needed]. But when asked by Bang Records which name he was going to use\, Noah\, Eice\, or Neil\, he thought of his grandmother\, who died prior to the release of Solitary Man. Thus he told Bang Records\, "...go with Neil Diamond and I'll figure it out later." Diamond followed it with "Cherry\, Cherry"\, "Kentucky Woman"\, "Thank the Lord for the Night Time"\, "Do It\," and others. Diamond's Bang recordings were produced by legendary Brill Building songwriters Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich\, both of whom can be heard singing background on many of the tracks...

COL title VAL Johnny Todd COL performer VAL Ewan MacColl with Brian Daley	COL video title VAL DENI HINES & CHRISTINE ANU - TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS COL description VAL Two of Australias most loved and successful female recording artists\, Deni Hines and Christine Anu\, are takin it to the streets again in 2009 after the success of their 2008 East-Coast of Australia tour.    On the first tour we had such a great time\, that we wanted to do it all over again\, especially when we have such a great cause to promote such as the Salvation Army and Oasis Youth Support Network. We feel privileged to be able to help says Christine & Deni.    In a two hour show\, this sassy duo will perform their classic hits and favourite timeless songs along with some special duets\, including their own rendition of the Doobie Brothers hit TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS.   While promoting their 2008 tour\, Deni and Christine so happened to be performing one of their show duets TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS on the Today Show (Nine Network\, Australia). On the same show was a heartfelt segment about the plight of homelessness in Australia accompanied by Captain Paul Mould of the Salvation Armys Oasis Youth Support Network\, who take care and provide much needed services for the homeless and youth of Australia (who come from all walks of life.)  No less than 5 minutes after walking off set\, Christine and Deni turned to each other and said weve got to do something to help and the recording of TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS was set in motion.   Deni and Christine will release their version of TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS on 15 November 2008 (Nationwide) with fifty percent (50%) of profits going to the Salvation Armys Youth Homelessness Oasis Foundation and the Everyone Is Homeless Fund.  On Wednesday\, 17th December Christine and Deni will also stage a free Christmas concert version of their TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS show exclusively for the Salvation Armys Youth Homelessness Oasis Foundation and the homeless people of Sydney.   For further information on Salvation Armys Youth Homelessness Oasis Foundation and the Everyone Is Homeless Fund\, please refer to www.oasis.salvos.org.au  In the ABS Census 2001 (The 2006 Census data has not been finalized)\, there were 100\,000 homeless people (men\, women and children) across Australia\, one third (36\,173) are youth between 12-24 years of age.  Only 14.25% of homeless people were able to stay in services funded through SAAP (Supported Accommodation Assistance Program) jointly funded by both the Commonwealth and State Governments.  Christine and Deni would like to thank the following companies and people for donating their time and services free of charge of the purposes of this donation campaign drive -  301 Studios\, Sing Sing Studios\, David and Anthony @ DNA Songs\, Tony Espie\, David Walker at Stepford Audio\, John Adams\, Franco Raggatt\, Barbara Griffin\, Cameron Undy\, Michael Rohanek and Rob Thompson.

Some day you'll return to  Your valleys and your farms  And you'll no longer burn  To be brothers in arms.    Through these fields of destruction  Baptism of fire  I've witnessed your suffering  As the battle raged higher.  And though they did hurt me so bad  In my fear and alarm  You did not desert me  My brothers in arms.    There's so many different worlds  So many different suns  And we have just one world  But we live in different ones.    Now the sun's gone to hell  And the moon's riding high  Let me bid you farewell  Every man has to die.  But it's written in the starlight  And every line in your palm  We're fools to make war  On our brothers in arms... COL channel name VAL UFCHeadhunter	0

Mastered at Project One Mastering.  ------------------------  "The One I Love" is a song by American rock band R.E.M.. It was released on the band's fifth full-length studio album\, Document\, and also as a 7" vinyl single in 1987. The song was their first hit single\, reaching #9 in the US Billboard Hot 100\, #14 in Canada\, and later reached #16 in the UK singles chart on its UK release (1991).  The song was included in Activision's Guitar Hero World Tour and is in Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades.  The accompanying video's director was artist Robert Longo.  The director of photography was Alton Brown\, who later became a Food Network chef.  In March 2005\, Q magazine placed "The One I Love" at number 57 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks.  The song is included on R.E.M. Live.  Lyrics and meaning  Many listeners who misunderstand the song's meaning have made the song a popular radio dedication to loved ones\, relying on the main lyric\, "This one goes out to the one I love."  However\, they missed an ensuing line: "A simple prop to occupy my time"; the song was not particularly a love song.  Stipe related in 1987 to Rolling Stone\, "I've always left myself pretty open to interpretation. It's probably better that they just think it's a love song at this point."  However\, in an interview in the January 1988 issue of Musician magazine he said that the song was "incredibly violent" and "It's very clear that it's about using people over and over again".  The song contains only three verses\, which are all near identical\, with small variations each repeat of the verse. (For example "A simple prop to occupy my time"\, "Another prop has occupied my time"). The chorus consists of just the word "fire"\, repeated (with the backing vocal of "She's coming down on her own now/Coming down on her own"\, sung by Mike Mills).  Cover versions  Bush Sufjan Stevens Massacre and many more. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

COL title VAL No Help Wanted COL performer VAL Bill Woods and His Orange Blossom Playboys with Hillbilly Barton	COL video title VAL Valentina - "Queen Of Hearts" COL description VAL Album  : Why Not Me Utgitt : 2007 Låtskrivere: Hank Devito Label: : CC Records (4) ‎– CCR 001 2007  Valentina was born and raised in Radnevo in Bulgaria\, a village 30 km south of Stara Zagora. She grew up with her parents and three siblings\, where it was her father who introduced her to the music when she was 10 years old. He was a musician himself. When she was 14\, her great love and Suzi Quatro became her great role model. The school's orchestra became her first gambling arena.  As an 18-year-old girl\, she began to sing and play professionally with a Bulgarian band. where they played around at the Black Sea tourist spots. She eventually got a lot of experience and got a job in a variety show.  Russia became the next venue. She also got to play for the Bulgarian president twice. In 1991 she came to Norway for the first time with "Smile Band". They played together for 15 years\, all over Norway and Europe. They had many great experiences together\, as when in 2001 she was singing and playing with one of her favorites\, Bonnie Taylor. She gave her a compliment\, which she will forever remember; “You sound more like me than I do”!   In 2003\, "Smile Band" broke up\, and Valentina started playing around as a troubadour. At Oset 2006\, she had the pleasure of meeting Bobby Bare. He invited her up on the stage and they sang and played together. It was a dream to stand in front of so many people singing. She also met Pam Tillis and Paul Young and the joy was also great when she got to play and sing along with Lynn Anderson In 2007 she released her first CD "Why not me". It sold over 16\,000 copies and the first gold plate was hung on the wall.  Now the second CD is finished\, "Comin` down the road"\, where Valentina is even stronger in her genre country-pop-rock. She has also included Stephen Ackles on a duet\, "To a tear becomes a rose"  #Valentina #QueenOfHearts# #CountryClassic #RonjasCountryMusic #RonjaGM COL channel name VAL RonjaGM	0

Inez sang lead vocal\, while Charlie sang back-up and played guitar.[1]   Their most successful record was with their novelty composition\, "Mockingbird". Released in 1963\, it made the Top 10 on both the rhythm and blues and pop charts; the song was later covered by artists including Aretha Franklin\, James Taylor\, Carly Simon\, Dusty Springfield and Toby Keith. Other notable recordings were "Hurt by Love\," "Ask Me\," and "(1-2-3-4-5-6-7) Count the Days."   They were known for their exciting live performances\, of which a highlight was Inez's rendition of "I Stand Accused"\, which finished with a supposedly distraught Inez singing the last verse\, while being carried offstage by Charlie. They toured extensively in Europe and their music played a key role in the development of the Northern Soul movement.   Inez also had some success recording on her own\, beginning in 1969\, but her popularity faded in the 1970s. Charlie was already working as a record producer when they finally disbanded their act.   Inez Foxx was married to the American songwriter and producer Luther Dixon. Together they wrote\, and he produced\, The Platters' mid-1960s return to hit-making with the single "I Love You 1000 Times".[2] Luther Dixon produced Inez and Charlie's 1967 album Come By Here\, but the couple later divorced.[2]   Charlie Foxx died from leukemia in 1998\, at the age of 58.

COL title VAL Daddy Rollin' Stone COL performer VAL Derek Martin	COL video title VAL The Charlie Daniels Band - Pride And Joy.wmv COL description VAL Tailgate Party This CD contains some of the greatest rock songs of all time. Originally made legendary by some of the south's best rock bands\, Charlie adds his own unique sound to each song. Originals\, live and studio versions make this collection live up to its' name by being a great one to pull out during a "Tailgate Party."   Description      13 Tracks previously released in 1999     Engineered\, Produced and Mixed by: Ron W. Griffin     Executive Producer: David Corlew  Guide Review - Charlie Daniels Band - Tailgate Party  Included on this very southern rock flavored collection are live versions of "The Legend of Wooley Swamp" and "The Devil Went Down to Georgia." With both songs being so well known and played a gazillion times\, it was refreshing to hear them live and just slightly different from what we are normally accustomed to.  "The South's Gonna Do It Again" had an added bonus to it by having a very early on in his career performance by Keith Urban\, showing us some very impressive guitar solo's. Remakes of ZZ Top's "Sharp Dressed Man" and Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Freebird" were very captivating and showed off some incredible fiddle playing by Charlie. Probably one of my most favorites was CDB's remake of the song made famous by Hootie and the Blowfish\, "Let Her Cry." Charlie has always been well known for his playing but under rated for his vocals. This song shows off just how well he can deliver some very heartfelt emotions and I really enjoyed listening to this new version.  If you have ever appreciated CDB\, you will really like this release. If for nothing else\, the diversity of the genre's and CDB being able to add the country sound without destroying the memory of the song.

COL title VAL She's Looking Good COL performer VAL Emil & The Ecstatics	COL video title VAL Maddox Brothers & Rose - No Help Wanted COL description VAL The Maddox Brothers and Rose\, known as America's Most Colorful Hillbilly Band from the 1930s to the 1950s\, consisted of four brothers\, Fred\, Cal\, Cliff and Don Maddox\, along with their sister Rose. Cliff died in 1949 and was replaced by brother Henry. The group disbanded in 1956.  The family hailed from Boaz\, Alabama\, but rode the rails and hitch hiked to California in 1933 when the band members were still children\, following the failed efforts of their sharecropper parents during the early part of the Depression. They were a little in advance of the flood of Okies who were to flood the state in the 30s. They struggled to make a living as intinerant fruit and vegetable pickers following the harvest as far north as Washington state\, and as far east as Arizona\, as well as in the San Joaquin Valley. They often worked from dawn to dusk\, sleeping and eating on the ground.  Having settled in Modesto\, the family developed their musical ability and\, in 1937 performed on the radio\, sponsored by a local furniture store. In 1939 they entered a hillbilly band competition at the centenial Sacramento State Fair after driving to Sacramento in their Model A. When they took the stage they tore through "Sally Let Your Bangs Hang Down" with rocking rhythms and risque lyrics. They became\, officially\, California's best hillbilly band.  The brothers and Rose appeared at places such as the 97th Street Corral in Los Angles.  From 1946-1951 the group recorded for 4 Star Records (Hollywood)\, then for Columbia Records. Some 4 Star masters were leased and released by US.-Decca Records at the beginning of the 1950s. The following quotes are from Rose Maddox. "We were called hillbilly singers - not country - then. No\, none of this country music then. People just called us hillbilly... People tell me that I was one of the first women to sing what I sang - country boogie. I guess I was. There was no rock 'n' roll in those early days\, before 1955. Only country boogie. My brothers also played that way. We called it country then.  The Maddox's material ranged from the country standards of Hank Williams and Merle Travis\, cowboy songs\, to the Western swing of Bob Wills\, to old-time\, folk\, and church singing\, to jazz\, swing\, boogie woogie and even a taste of early rock and roll.  Fred Maddox played upright bass using the "slap bass" technique as early as 1937.[5] This trademark backbeat\, a slapping bass style\, helped drive a broad change in popular music\, sporting a faster\, immediately discernible rhythm that came to be known as rockabilly.  Fred Maddox's bass is displayed at the Experience Music Project in Seattle. "They wanted his bass because they believe he might have hit the first note of rock 'n' roll on it.

Cale\, Snuff Garrett  This was a Snuff Garrett project as a compilation album of covers of numbers that were popular on Hollywood's Sunset Strip. These were combined with newly-written numbers by J.J. Cale who was a member of the makeshift group assembled for the recording\, who called themselves "The Leathercoated Minds".  ------------------------  "Along Comes Mary" is a song composed by Tandyn Almer\, originally recorded in 1966 by American sunshine pop band the Association. It was the group's first hit\, released on their debut album\, And Then... Along Comes the Association (1966).  Background  "Along Comes Mary" is sung from the point of view of a once-disillusioned young man talking about the "tribulations no one ever sees" and who "curse[s] those faults in me." The singer believes Mary gives him comfort and improves his life. An acquaintance of Almer claimed in an interview that "Mary" refers to marijuana\, though it is unclear if Almer ever confirmed this. In the Young People's Concert titled What Is a Mode? Leonard Bernstein explained that the song was composed in the Dorian mode.  Bloodhound Gang version  American rock band Bloodhound Gang recorded a version of "Along Comes Mary" with new punk music to accompany the lyrics. It first appeared on the 1998 soundtrack to the film Half Baked before appearing on Bloodhound Gang's third studio album\, Hooray for Boobies\, the following year. "Along Comes Mary" was released as the album's first single in May 1999 and reached No. 5 in Austria\, No. 6 in Germany\, and No. 13 in Switzerland. The song was certified gold in both Austria and Germany.  Other covers  In 1966\, Hugh Masekela included the song on his album Hugh Masekela's Next Album\, and in 1967\, Cal Tjader covered it for his album Along Comes Cal. That same year\, Baja Marimba Band's had a minor hit with their cover of the song.  In 1968\, George Benson included a version on his album Giblet Gravy\, and in 1986 a cover appeared on R. Stevie Moore's album Glad Music.  In 1995\, the Manhattan Transfer covered the song for their album Tonin'\, and the following year\, 24-7 Spyz covered it for their album 6.  In 2005\, a cover of the song appeared on the Guess Who's compilation album Let's Go\, and Plainsong also released a cover on their self-titled album.  ------------------------  Lyrics  Every time I think that I'm the only one who's lonely someone calls on me. And every now and then I spend my time in rhyme and verse and curse those faults in me.  And then along comes Mary And does she want to give me kicks\, and be my steady chick and give me pick of memories Or maybe rather gather tales of all the fails and tribulations no one ever sees.  When we met I was sure out to lunch Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch.  When vague desire is the fire in the eyes of chicks whose sickness is the games they play. And when the masquerade is played and neighbor folks make jokes as who is most to blame today.  And then along comes Mary And does she want to set them free\, and let them see reality from where she got her name. And will they struggle much when told that such a tender touch as hers will make them not the same.  When we met I was sure out to lunch Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch\, sweet as the punch\, sweet as the punch\, sweet as the punch\, sweet as the punch.

The record was released in June 1979 on Optional Music with "The Man with the Dogs" as the b-side. The title track was re-recorded for the band's first album\, Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables (1980)\, and the version that appeared on this single\, as well as the single's b-side\, are available on the rarities album Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death (1987).  The lyrics were written by Jello Biafra and John Greenway\, and Biafra composed the music in one of his rare attempts at composing on bass.  This song was featured in the video game Tony Hawk's American Wasteland and as a downloadable song in the Rock Band series. It is also sampled in a song by the dance-punk/big beat trio The Prodigy\, "Dead Ken Beats". The song was also featured in the 2010 film The Social Network.  Meaning  The title is an allusion to the first (and no longer sung) stanza of the national anthem of Germany\, which begins with the words "Deutschland\, Deutschland über alles." (literally\, "Germany\, Germany above all.")  The song focuses on Jerry Brown\, the Governor of California 1975-1983 and 2011--present\, and is sung from his perspective. An imaginary Brown outlines a hippie-fascist vision for America\, in which his "suede denim secret police" kill un-cool people with "organic poison gas" chambers. Lines such as "Serpent's egg already hatched" (a reference to a line from William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar) comment on the corrosive nature of power. The line "now it is 1984" refers to the totalitarian regime of George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four\, describing a future (from 1979) where Jerry Brown has become President Brown presiding over secret police and gas chambers.  Cover versions  Blue Ribbon Glee Club regularly perform their version of the song.  The song was updated by The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy when they released a cover version in 1992 on the album Hypocrisy is the Greatest Legacy. They replaced references to Jerry Brown with references to Pete Wilson.  The song was also widely known in Poland (as "Kalifornia Ponad Wszystko") thanks to the cover by Polish rocker Kazik Staszewski with his band Kazik Na Żywo.  Hasidic New Wave perform a remake of the song on their 1999 album\, Kabalogy. In their version\, titled "Giuliani Über Alles"\, Jerry Brown is replaced by former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani.  The Delgados cover the song in their Peel Sessions CD set.  Six Feet Under do a cover the song on their Graveyard Classics album.  The black metal band Mayhem also covered the song.  Deceased covered the song on their punk covers album Rotten to the Core.  The hardcore band Ceremony has covered the song.  The Who Boys have done a mashup of "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" by Gil Scott-Heron called "Revolution Über Alles".  John Linnell and his band The Statesmen covered it live at least once during his "State Songs" tour\, choosing to perform it because it mentioned the state of California.  Dramarama has recorded a version\, updated in 2003 about California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger... "You will lift weights in school".  A 1986 live recording focused on Ronald Reagan on the album Mutiny On The Bay with live recordings from 1982 and 1986.  Jayne County covered the song with She Wolves about California's Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The green vinyl single was released under artist name Jayne County Meets The She Wolves by the German label Trash 2001.  Mexican death metal band Brujería covers Dead Kennedys with the song "California Uber Aztlan" in 2010. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

COL title VAL Chelsea Hotel COL performer VAL Meshell Ndegeocello	COL video title VAL The Coal Porters - Another Girl\, Another Planet (live) COL description VAL The Coal Porters play Another Girl Another Planet live in Wales\, 2014.  Another Girl Another Planet is featured on The Coal Porters new album\, No. 6. No. 6\, is produced by John Wood\, the legendary British folk-rock mastermind who recorded the classic albums of Fairport Convention\, Nick Drake\, Beth Orton and Squeeze. No. 6 is a bit of a departure for the Coal Porters as it pushes their musical boundaries further than ever before.The Coal Porters - No. 6  https://thecoalporters.com / https://thecoalporters.bandcamp.com / https://www.facebook.com/thecoalporters  This new album features Kerenza quadruple tracking herself into a string quartet\, Andrew on a ukulele\, Sid on trusty autoharp and mandolin\, both Neil and Paul on dobro\, a Byrdsy acoustic 12-string guitar\, and very emotional\, long\, sweet trumpet solo by Cuba’s noted “son y mambo” music virtuoso Eikel Venegas. There has never been music like this before. And already\, the album’s opening track\, Sid’s “The Day The Last Ramone Died\,” is being hailed as a classic.  Recorded in two creative bursts in late 2014 and in 2015 this is the Coal Porters album which took three years to incubate. Four new Sid songs\, three new Neil Bob Herd originals\, and Kerenza Peacock contributed her first recorded lead vocal on a very personal song with Play A Tune while also gracing the record with a totally catchy instrumental\, Chopping The Garlic. The album goes out on a high note with the band’s warm-hearted cover of the Only Ones’ classic hit Another Girl\, Another Planet.  No.6 was released in September 2016 and can be ordered via Amazon\, iTunes\, the Sid Griffin website and in all good records stores.

COL title VAL Ae Fond Kiss COL performer VAL Eddi Reader	COL video title VAL 1913 Massacre Ramblin' Jack Elliott COL description VAL 1913 Massacre American Folk Tales Ramblin' Jack Elliot  The 1913 Massacre is based on an event that took place just as the song says in Calumet\, Michigan on December 24\, 1913. It is always known as the Italian Hall Disaster. The strike that led up to this was one of the longest\, most dangerous strikes that took place in Michigan. The song refers to copper country which is the upper peninsula of Michigan.  The miners were striking for better pay\, shortened work days and safer working conditions. Worker's pay was based on the depth of penetration into the mines made by his group that day. The mine was switching to using a one man drill\, the mechanical drill cutting cost for the mines. However it broke up the family groups that worked in the mines together and cut many jobs. Most workers made around $2.75 a day for 10 - 12 hours a day.   The strike had been going on for 5 months. The striking miners and their families had gathered at the Italian Hall for a Christmas party. It is thought that there were five hundred people at the party. The building had a steep staircase and the party was being held on the second floor. There was a fire escape\, however as was common at the time\, it was poorly marked\, poorly lit\, and could only be reached by climbing through the window. Someone yelled "fire" and in the panic that followed 73 people were killed. Over half of the people killed were children between the ages of six and ten.  The investigations that followed produced no culprit. Part of the problem was victims who did not speak English were questioned and forced to answer in English. In other cases witnesses were not questioned at all. It was and still is commonly thought that out of town strike breakers\, funded by mine management\, were the ones that yelled fire.  The Italian Hall has since been demolished\, and only the archway remains from that day. A state historical markers marks the spot and date. COL channel name VAL leanannsidhe	0

Unlike Marc Blitzstein's version which ran during the 1950's for six years and featured the incomparable Lotte Lenya\, this translation is less sanitized and more in keeping with the seedy and sexual nature of the original german play.    From the liner notes to the album - "the successful Blitzstein version was an adaptation rather than a translation\, and in comparing it to the original\, we were surprised at the extent to which his treatment vitiated the political and sexual thrust which gives the work its relentless power.  Blitzstein sweetened and cleaned up Brecht's unsparing lyrics\, partially in deference to stage censorship...but in doing so he in many instances changed Brecht's meanings around entirely\, and throughout he softened the impact of Brecht's biting ferocity.  He also attempted to make the lyrics more 'singable' by fitting them into conventional musical patterns\, and in this he succeeded admirably."  The translation used for this revival was prepared by Ralph Maheim and John Willett; the full text can be found in their edition of Brecht's Collected Plays\, Volume 2.  A hardcover edition was also published in conjunction with the revival.  This revival was directed by conceptual theater artist Richard Foreman\, and starred Raul Julia and Ellen Greene\, both of whom were nominated for Tony Awards.  It was produced by Joseph Papp and the New York Shakespeare Festival at the Vivian Beaumont Theatre at Lincoln Center.  Additional information regarding the production\, including cast list\, can be found at the Internet Broadway Database's listing for this revival at http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=3835 ...  As of June 2007\, this cast album has not been released or reissued on CD; it was originally made available in 1976 on LP\, and this is an LP transfer.  As such\, the quality is not CD quality  - there will occasionally be noise\, popping\, or hissing.

In her three-decade long career as a solo artist\, Made in Brazil results from the first time she’s recorded a disc in her native Brazil since moving to the United States in 1981. (International release dates may vary)  Elias wears many hats on this project as producer\, composer\, lyricist\, arranger\, pianist and vocalist. “I am completely immersed and involved in every single detail of the music and the recording process\, from the birth of an idea until its completion through every aspect of the production until it reaches the public\,” she explains.  Along with co-producers\, Steve Rodby and Marc Johnson\, her bass playing musical partner\, Elias ventured ‘home’ and recruited a splendid cast of Brazilian musicians that include electric bassist Marcelo Mariano; guitarists Marcus Teixeira and Roberto Menescal; drummers Edu Ribeiro and Rafael Barata; and percussionists Mauro Refosco and Marivaldo dos Santos.  Elias peppered the sessions with delightful special guest performances from Mark Kibble and the multi-GRAMMY® Award-winning gospel vocal group Take 6; her singer/songwriter-daughter Amanda Brecker; one of Brazil’s most celebrated R&B stars\, Ed Motta; and the distinguished bossa nova composer Roberto Menescal.  Elias also invited Rob Mathes to handle orchestral arrangements on seven of the 12 tracks\, which were recorded in London at the legendary Abbey Road Studios. “It’s so touching to hear the music unfold\,” she says of the orchestral arrangements after they were overdubbed onto the São Paulo sessions. “You can see the musical notes on paper\, but it’s something else to hear them realized and performed by members of the London Symphonic Orchestra.” COL channel name VAL Concord Records	0

COL title VAL Crazy COL performer VAL Quietdrive	COL video title VAL Neil Diamond - Cherry Cherry (REMASTERED) COL description VAL Remastered by Figago - High Quality   Neil Leslie Diamond (born on January 24\, 1941) is an American singer-songwriter. As a successful pop music performer\, Diamond scored a number of hits worldwide in the 1960s\, 1970s\, and 1980s. According to David Wild\, common themes in Diamond's songs are "a deep sense of isolation and an equal desire for connection. A yearning for home -- and at the same time\, the allure of greater freedom. The good\, the bad and the ugly about a crazy little thing called love."  As of 2001 Diamond has 115 million records sold worldwide\, including 48 million records in the U.S. In terms of Billboard chart success\, he is the third most successful Adult Contemporary artist ever\, ranking behind only Barbra Streisand and Elton John.  Though his record sales declined somewhat after the 1980s\, Diamond continues to tour successfully\, and maintains a very loyal following. Diamond's songs have been recorded by a vast array of performers from many different musical genres.  Diamond was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1984\, and in 2000 received the Sammy Cahn Lifetime Achievement Award.  In 1966 Diamond signed a deal with Bert Berns's Bang Records label\, which was then a subsidiary company of Atlantic Records. His first release on that label\, "Solitary Man"\, was his first hit. Prior to the release of "Solitary Man\," Neil had considered using a stage name; he came up with two possible stage names\, "Noah Kaminsky"[citation needed] and "Eice Chary"[citation needed]. But when asked by Bang Records which name he was going to use\, Noah\, Eice\, or Neil\, he thought of his grandmother\, who died prior to the release of Solitary Man. Thus he told Bang Records\, "...go with Neil Diamond and I'll figure it out later." Diamond followed it with "Cherry\, Cherry"\, "Kentucky Woman"\, "Thank the Lord for the Night Time"\, "Do It\," and others. Diamond's Bang recordings were produced by legendary Brill Building songwriters Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich\, both of whom can be heard singing background on many of the tracks...

COL title VAL Takin' It to the Streets COL performer VAL The Dukes of September	COL video title VAL DENI HINES & CHRISTINE ANU - TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS COL description VAL Two of Australias most loved and successful female recording artists\, Deni Hines and Christine Anu\, are takin it to the streets again in 2009 after the success of their 2008 East-Coast of Australia tour.    On the first tour we had such a great time\, that we wanted to do it all over again\, especially when we have such a great cause to promote such as the Salvation Army and Oasis Youth Support Network. We feel privileged to be able to help says Christine & Deni.    In a two hour show\, this sassy duo will perform their classic hits and favourite timeless songs along with some special duets\, including their own rendition of the Doobie Brothers hit TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS.   While promoting their 2008 tour\, Deni and Christine so happened to be performing one of their show duets TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS on the Today Show (Nine Network\, Australia). On the same show was a heartfelt segment about the plight of homelessness in Australia accompanied by Captain Paul Mould of the Salvation Armys Oasis Youth Support Network\, who take care and provide much needed services for the homeless and youth of Australia (who come from all walks of life.)  No less than 5 minutes after walking off set\, Christine and Deni turned to each other and said weve got to do something to help and the recording of TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS was set in motion.   Deni and Christine will release their version of TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS on 15 November 2008 (Nationwide) with fifty percent (50%) of profits going to the Salvation Armys Youth Homelessness Oasis Foundation and the Everyone Is Homeless Fund.  On Wednesday\, 17th December Christine and Deni will also stage a free Christmas concert version of their TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS show exclusively for the Salvation Armys Youth Homelessness Oasis Foundation and the homeless people of Sydney.   For further information on Salvation Armys Youth Homelessness Oasis Foundation and the Everyone Is Homeless Fund\, please refer to www.oasis.salvos.org.au  In the ABS Census 2001 (The 2006 Census data has not been finalized)\, there were 100\,000 homeless people (men\, women and children) across Australia\, one third (36\,173) are youth between 12-24 years of age.  Only 14.25% of homeless people were able to stay in services funded through SAAP (Supported Accommodation Assistance Program) jointly funded by both the Commonwealth and State Governments.  Christine and Deni would like to thank the following companies and people for donating their time and services free of charge of the purposes of this donation campaign drive -  301 Studios\, Sing Sing Studios\, David and Anthony @ DNA Songs\, Tony Espie\, David Walker at Stepford Audio\, John Adams\, Franco Raggatt\, Barbara Griffin\, Cameron Undy\, Michael Rohanek and Rob Thompson.

Banes Drums\, Percussion -- Jimmy Young  ------------------------  "Fire" is a 1968 song by Arthur Brown\, Vincent Crane\, Mike Finesilver and Peter Ker. Performed by The Crazy World of Arthur Brown\, it was released as a single and on the band's debut album\, also called The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. The single made #1 in the UK (in August 1968) and Canada. In October\, it made #2 in the US Billboard charts and #19 in Australia. It also made #6 in the Netherlands. "Fire" sold over one million copies\, and was awarded a gold disc.  The song is an example of the psychedelic rock of the period\, though its lack of guitars or bass guitar distinguished it from many of its contemporaries. The lead instrument in this case was Vincent Crane's Hammond electronic organ\, augmented by an orchestral section featuring prominent brass. The singer's opening proclamation of himself as "the god of hellfire" became a lasting epithet. The song's other memorable line is "You're Gonna Burn!!". The song ends with the sound of a wind from hell.  During live performances and in the black and white promotional television clip\, Brown performed the song wearing a burning helmet. The helmet was improvised with a leather skull cap onto which was bolted a metal dish that held lighter fluid or petrol. As the cap was not insulated\, the heat from the burning fuel quickly conducted through the fixing bolt to the top of Brown's head\, causing him considerable pain.  Two studio mixes of "Fire" have been officially released\, one in stereo and one in mono. The mono mix features no brass. Both versions are included on the CD reissue of The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. The single B-side\, "Rest Cure"\, was another track from the album.  Credit for the composition of "Fire" on the original vinyl single was to Arthur Brown and Vincent Crane only; however\, Mike Finesilver and Peter Ker successfully sued for co-credit and royalties based on melodic similarities to their song "Baby\, You're a Long Way Behind".  The song is briefly featured in the films Hot Fuzz (2007) and The Boat That Rocked (2009). It is also referenced in Julie Hearn's debut novel Follow Me Down\, and was used in the episode "Burn Victim" of My Name Is Earl.  Cover versions  The Ventures covered the song on their 1969 album Underground Fire. Lizzy Mercier Descloux covered "Fire" on her album Press Color (1979)\, drastically changing the mood and style of the track. Pete Townshend\, the single's associate producer\, covered "Fire" as a member of The Who on his 1989 album The Iron Man: A Musical. Cirith Ungol covered the song on their 1991 album Paradise Lost. The Prodigy sampled the track for "Fire/Jericho"\, which was otherwise a completely different song\, on their 1992 album Experience. Emerson\, Lake & Palmer covered the song on their 1993 4-disc compilation album The Return of the Manticore. German dark electro act AmGod covered the song several times. The most well-known version is "Fire v.2" featured on the 1994 album Half Rotten and Decayed. Though it was not a true 'cover'\, Marilyn Manson's "Lunchbox" (1995) heavily samples "Fire". UK doom metal band Cathedral covered the song on their 1996 EP Hopkins (The Witchfinder General). Die Krupps covered the song on their 1997 album Paradise Now. Dutch death metal band God Dethroned covered the song on their 1997 album The Grand Grimoire. Ozzy Osbourne included a version on his 2005 album Under Cover. The song is used in one episode of Series 3 of Monkey Dust (2005) as the Paedofinder General burns the wrongly accused paedophiles with this music in the background\, complete with bastardised lyrics. US Hip hop duo Cunninlynguists sampled the song for "Hellfire" on their 2006 album A Piece of Strange. Leningrad Cowboys covered the song in a metal style and included it on their 2006 album Zombie's Paradise. Appears in the musical Disco Inferno\, when the character Duke reveals himself to be Satan in disguise.[citation needed] Death Grips\, an experimental hip hop group backed by drummer Zach Hill\, sampled "Fire" in their song "Lord of the Game".

COL title VAL That's Entertainment COL performer VAL The Wonder Stuff	COL video title VAL Harpers Bizarre - Witchi Tai To COL description VAL Harpers Bizarre 4 is an album by Harpers Bizarre (Warner Bros. 1969) Ry Cooder contributes on slide guitar.  the song "Witchi Tai To" by jazzman Jim Pepper was given the group's smooth harmony veneer and mock-rococo production.  Pepper\,  was of Native American descent\, from the Plains tribes of the Kaw and the Cree. He came from a family of "road men"\, the peyote priests of the Native American Church. He was also a jazz saxophonist\, playing primarily tenor sax (but also soprano sax and flute).  encouraged by friends Ornette Coleman and Don Cherry\, Pepper began experimenting with mixing Native American music and jazz\, with interesting results. "Witchi Tai To" is a prime example of that blending\, taking a peyote song he'd learned from his grandfather and putting it in a jazz setting. COL channel name VAL mojavemoog	0

Era el verano claro está\, y yo empezaba a soñar con mi pasado. Ante un espejo le fingí que maquillaba mi nariz para mirarle. Cuando me vi tan cerca de él había dado no sé qué por conquistarle.  Me sonrió con intención y fue su edad la explicación de su victoria. No quiso hablarme del amor\, pues según él esa cuestión es otra historia. Me dijo tú me vas muy bien\, eres igual que la mujer de "El Graduado". Yo no pude resistir y entre sus brazos descubrí\, un sol dorado.  Dieciocho años nada más eso le hizo ser audaz mas que insolente. Cuando llegué a despertar\, solo sentí la soledad indiferente. Por un momento pretendí el retenerlo junto a mí\, pero no quise. Me dijo no has estado mal\, con un candor tan infernal\, antes de irse. Entonces tuve que fingir que maquillaba mi nariz\, para no verle y estuve a punto de olvidar que yo le doblaba la edad.

COL title VAL Faithless Love COL performer VAL John David Souther	COL video title VAL Jamey Ryan ~ Willie and Laura Mae Jones (1969) [LIVE] COL description VAL From the August 14\, 1969 episode of the "Del Reeves Country Carnival".  About Jamey: Jamey Ryan is an American Country Music singer\, born in Texas in 1947.  A cousin of singer Goldie Hill\, and Songwriter/Producer Tommy Hill\, Jamey came to Nashville in her teens to launch a singing career. She started out recording demos for the writers at Starday Records\, where she met Charlie Dick\, Patsy Cline's Widower\, who was National Director of Promotion for the label. Jamey and Charlie were married in 1965\, and she gave birth to their son "Chip" the following year.  Jamey signed with Columbia Records and recorded 3 singles for the label\, scoring a minor hit with "You're Lookin' For A Plaything" in 1967. Without further success\, she left Columbia and signed to ShowBiz Records\, the fledgling music operation of ShowBiz Inc. ShowBiz was the production company behind many of the major Country Music TV shows of the day\, including "The Porter Wagoner Show" and "The Wilburn Brothers Show." Jamey also signed on as the featured female performer for ShowBiz's "Del Reeves Country Carnival" TV program.  Jamey recorded a number of singles for the ShowBiz label\, having a minor chart hit in 1969 with her cover of the Allen Toussaint song "Holy Cow." She remained with the label\, and "Del Reeves Country Carnival" until 1972 (the same year she and Charlie Dick divorced).  Jamey signed with the Country division of Atlantic Records\, and recorded a few sides with Producer Pete Drake\, scoring her third and final chart entry with "Keep On Loving Me" in 1973. Jamey recorded for a couple of small labels in the late '70's\, but eventually stopped recording and touring\, and went to work behind the scenes in the music business.  In a twist of irony\, many people hear striking similarities between Jamey's vocals and those of Patsy Cline. So much so that\, in 1984\, legendary Producer Owen Bradley asked Jamey to provide vocals for two recordings to be used in the movie "Sweet Dreams" about Patsy's life. In 1991\, Jamey also recorded Patsy's "I Fall To Pieces" for use in a TV Commercial about the Mazda RX7 sports car.  Today\, Jamey is a devoted wife\, mother and grandmother. She and Charlie Dick remain good friends\, and she is especially close to Patsy and Charlie's children\, Julie and Randy\, and their families. COL channel name VAL Down On Music Row	0

COL title VAL I'll Know COL performer VAL The Morris Nanton Trio	COL video title VAL Peggy Lee - He's My Guy COL description VAL Peggy Lee's alluring tone\, distinctive delivery\, breadth of material\, and ability to write many of her own songs made her one of the most captivating artists of the vocal era\, from her breakthrough on the Benny Goodman hit "Why Don't You Do Right" to her many solo successes\, singles including "Mañana\," "Lover" and "Fever" that showed her bewitching vocal power\, a balance between sultry swing and impeccable musicianship.  Born Norma Egstrom in Jamestown\, North Dakota\, she suffered the death of her mother at the age of four and endured a difficult stepmother after her father remarried. Given her sense of swing by listening to Count Basie on the radio\, she taught herself to sing and made her radio debut at the age of 14. She made the jump to Fargo (where she was christened Peggy Lee)\, then to Minneapolis and St. Louis to sing with a regional band. Lee twice journeyed to Hollywood to make her fortune\, but returned unsuccessful from both trips.  She finally got her big break in 1941\, when a vocal group she worked with began appearing at a club in Chicago. While there\, she was heard by Benny Goodman\, whose regular vocalist Helen Forrest was about to leave his band. Lee recorded with Goodman just a few days later\, debuting with the popular "Elmer's Tune" despite a good deal of nerves. That same year\, several songs became commercial successes including "I Got It Bad (And That Ain't Good)" and "Winter Weather." In 1943\, "Why Don't You Do Right" became her first major hit\, but she left the Goodman band (and the music industry altogether) later that year after marrying Goodman's guitarist\, Dave Barbour.  After just over a year of domestic life\, Peggy Lee returned to music\, first as part of an all-star jazz album. Then\, in late 1945\, Capitol signed her to a solo contract and she hit the charts with her first shot\, "Waitin' for the Train to Come In." Lee continued to score during the late '40s\, with over two dozen chart entries before the end of the decade\, including "It's a Good Day\," "Mañana (Is Soon Enough for Me)" -- the most popular song of 1948 -- and "I Don't Know Enough About You." Many of her singles were done in conjunction with Barbour\, her frequent writing and recording partner.  After moving to Decca in 1952\, Peggy Lee scored with the single "Lover" and an LP\, Songs From Pete Kelly's Blues recorded with Ella Fitzgerald (both singers also made appearances in the film). She spent only five years at Decca however\, before moving back to Capitol. There\, she distinguished herself through recording a wide variety of material\, including songs -- and occasionally\, entire LPs -- influenced by the blues\, Latin and cabaret as well as pop. Lee also used many different settings\, like an orchestra conducted by none other than Frank Sinatra for 1957's The Man I Love\, the George Shearing Quintet for 1959's live appearance Beauty and the Beat\, Quincey Jones as arranger and conductor for 1961's If You Go\, and arrangements by Benny Carter on 1963's Mink Jazz. Barbour's problems with alcoholism ended their marriage\, though they remained good friends until his death in 1965.  Peggy Lee was an early advocate of rock and made a quick transition into rock-oriented material. Given her depth and open mind for great songs no matter the source\, it wasn't much of a surprise that she sounded quite comfortable covering the more song-oriented end of late-'60s rock\, including great choices by Jimmy Webb\, Buffy Sainte-Marie\, Burt Bacharach\, Randy Newman\, Goffin & King and John Sebastian. She nearly brushed the Top Ten in 1969 with Leiber & Stoller's "Is That All There Is?" She continued recording contemporary material until 1972's Norma Deloris Egstrom From Jamestown\, North Dakota brought her back to her roots. It was her last LP for Capitol\, however. Lee recorded single LPs for Atlantic\, A&M\, Polydor UK and DRG before effectively retiring at the beginning of the 1980s. She returned in 1988 with two LPs for Music Masters that revisited her earlier successes. Her last album\, Moments Like This\, was recorded in 1992 for Chesky. Her voice was effectively silenced after a 1998 stroke\, and she died of a heart attack at her Bel Air home in early 2002. ~ John Bush\, All Music Guide  PLEASE NOTE:  I divided my uploads among multiple channels\,  Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

COL title VAL Goofus COL performer VAL Carpenters	COL video title VAL Wayne King & His Orchestra - Goofus (1930) COL description VAL Wayne King\, born Harold Wayne King\, (February 16\, 1901  July 16\, 1985) was an American musician\, songwriter\, singer and orchestral leader. He was sometimes referred to as "the Waltz King" because most of his popular music involved waltzes; "The Waltz You Saved For Me" was his Theme Song. Born in Savanna\, Illinois\, King was an impressive athlete in high school\, and briefly played professional football with the Canton Bulldogs. He also attended Valparaiso University in Indiana for two years\, but left to begin a career in music. After playing saxophone for the Paul Whiteman Orchestra\, he created "Wayne King and Orchestra" in 1927. King's innovations included converting Carrie Jacobs-Bond's "I Love You Truly" from its original 2/4 time over to 3/4. The orchestra disbanded during World War II\, and King joined the army\, advancing to the rank of major. The orchestra was reestablished in 1946. King's orchestra had a television show in Chicago from 1949 to 1952. He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the Radio category.  In later years he operated a Black Angus cattle farm and a car rental business. In early 1958 he appeared as a guest challenger on the TV panel show "To Tell The Truth". He released a Christmas album on Decca Records\, Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\, in 1963. King's orchestra played its last engagement in March 1983 at the Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall in Sarasota\, Florida. COL channel name VAL ASACurator	1

I drove all night Crept in your room Woke you from your sleep To make love to you Is that all right? I drove all night  What in this world Keeps us from falling apart? No matter where I go I hear The beating of our one heart I think about you When the night is cold and dark\, uh-huh\, yeah No one can move me The way that you do Nothing erases this feeling between me and you\, oh  I drove all night to get to you Is that all right? I drove all night Crept in your room Woke you from your sleep To make love to you Is that all right? I drove all night  I taste your sweet kisses Your arms open wide This fever for you is just burning me up inside  I drove all night to get to you Is that all right? I drove all night Crept in your room Is that all right? I drove all night (I drove all night) I drove all night (To get to you) To get to you (Is that all right?) Is that all right?

I'm still not sure what to make of same sex marriage. I am a stout conservative however I believe that people should be free to share their lives with whom they wish or fall in love with regardless of sexual barriers and live it as they see fit as long as harm is not brought to others\, judgments I leave to God\, that is regarding that my rights are not encroached upon by the rights of others.  This being said I do believe that if not marriage as defined between a men and a woman there should be similar laws that protect and gives the proper rights to any two persons who form a serious home and a relationship together.  I do have friends who are in such relationships\, I do not condone discrimination based on sexual preferences and to them I dedicate this record by the great Charles Aznavour\,  it tells a touching and very lonely story.

Some day you'll return to  Your valleys and your farms  And you'll no longer burn  To be brothers in arms.    Through these fields of destruction  Baptism of fire  I've witnessed your suffering  As the battle raged higher.  And though they did hurt me so bad  In my fear and alarm  You did not desert me  My brothers in arms.    There's so many different worlds  So many different suns  And we have just one world  But we live in different ones.    Now the sun's gone to hell  And the moon's riding high  Let me bid you farewell  Every man has to die.  But it's written in the starlight  And every line in your palm  We're fools to make war  On our brothers in arms... COL channel name VAL UFCHeadhunter	0

COL title VAL (Just Like) Starting Over COL performer VAL Kat Edmonson	COL video title VAL John Lennon - (Just Like) Starting Over - Original Vinyl Single 45 rpm. GEF49604 COL description VAL It's a original 1980 single 45 rpm of John Lennon (Just Like) Starting Over with B side Kiss Kiss Kiss of Yoko Ono by the label Geffen Records . This was the first single released from Double Fantasy\, and the first new recording Lennon had released since 1975. It was chosen by Lennon not because he felt it was the best track on the album\, but because it was the most appropriate following his five year absence from the recording industry. He referred to it during production as the "Elvis/Orbison" track\, as he "tongue in cheek" impersonated their vocal styles. The uplifting bell at the intro of the song serves as the antidote to the morose bell sound which opens Lennon's first solo album\, Lennon seeing it as his having come full circle.

The song became a number 1 in the States for Margaret Whiting in 1948 staying on the chart for 23 weeks. This version by Marty comes from his 1977 album 'Don't Let Me Touch You.' Other singers to have recorded the song include Al Jolson\, Frank Sinatra and Connie Francis. Regarding Reid's songs 'The Gypsy' and 'A Tree In The Meadow'\, it's a pity that songs like this don't seem to get written nowadays. It seems that melody\, lyric and romance have all gone out the window in this day and age. Pity. COL channel name VAL tarquin45	0

COL title VAL How Ya Gonna Keep 'Em Down on the Farm COL performer VAL Andrew Bird	COL video title VAL "How Ya Gonna Keep 'Em Down on the Farm?" (Nora Bayes\, 1919) COL description VAL America was as quick in getting out of Europe following World War One as she was tardy in entering that conflict. As a nation\, we were forever transformed...America's involvement in World War One brought a change of character with it\, and that change was felt nowhere more keenly than Rural America. Looking back\, the family farm has been in decline ever since. Walter Donaldson wrote the music to this in 1919 (Joe Young and Sam M. Lewis wrote the words)\, and the song wound up being an overnight smash hit.

HOW YA GONNA KEEP 'EM DOWN ON THE FARM?

COL title VAL Barbie Girl COL performer VAL Aqua	COL video title VAL Bill Keith Homestead on The Farm COL description VAL William Bradford Keith was born in Boston\, Massachusetts. He attended Amherst College and graduated in 1961. In 1963 he became a member of Bill Monroe's Bluegrass Boys.   Keith's recordings and performances during these nine months with Monroe permanently altered banjo playing\, and his style has become an important part of the playing styles of many banjoists. After leaving the Bluegrass Boys\, he joined "Jim Kweskin Jug Band" playing plectrum banjo. He began playing the steel guitar and soon after 1968\, found himself working together with Ian and Sylvia and Jonathan Edwards. In the 1970s Keith recorded for Rounder Records. Over the years he has performed with several other musicians\, such as Clarence White and David Grisman in Muleskinner\, Tony Trischka\, Jim Rooney and Jim Collier. Today\, Keith style is still regarded as modern or progressive in the context of bluegrass banjo playing.    Keith made a mechanical contribution to the banjo\, as well. He designed a specialized type of banjo tuning peg that facilitates changing quickly from one open tuning to another\, while playing. Earlier famed banjoist Earl Scruggs had designed a set of cams which were added to the banjo to perform this task. Keith's invention made the extra hardware unnecessary\, replacing two of the tuning machines already on the banjo — a more elegant solution. Scruggs himself became a partner in the venture for a while\, and the product was known as "Scruggs-Keith Pegs". Known today simply as Keith Pegs\, they remain the state of the art\, and Bill Keith continues to manufacture and market them personally as the primary product of his own company\, the Beacon Banjo Company.

COL title VAL Roar COL performer VAL Alex Goot feat. Sam Tsui	COL video title VAL Eric Benet & Faith Evans ~ Georgy Porgy "1999"  R&B  Rock COL description VAL A version by US soul band Charme was released in 1979 featuring an uncredited vocal by Luther Vandross. The single was re-released a few years later after the vocalist's rise in popularity and he was then credited as the featured artist. It remains a popular version in rare groove circles.  US disco/jazz-funk band Side Effect released their own version in 1980. It was on their "After The Rain" album. It made it to 77 in the US R&B charts.  In 1999\, a cover version by Eric Benét (with Faith Evans on background vocals) was released as the first single from Benét's album A Day in the Life. Their version reached number two in New Zealand.  MC Lyte used this song as the musical foundation of "Poor Georgie"\, from her 1991 album Act Like You Know. The song was used by Devin the Dude in his song "Georgy" from album "The Dude (Devin the Dude album)" and by Guru in "Kissed the World" from album "Jazzmatazz\, Vol. 4: The Hip-Hop Jazz Messenger: Back to the Future" also.  In 2002\, Japanese musician Ringo Sheena formed the band Yokoshima (邪) solely to play cover of Georgy Porgy.  In 2005\, guitarist Nils offered a rendition of this song from his popular Contemporary jazz radio Baja/TSR Records released album\, 'Pacific Coast Highway.'[4] Its also sampled on the remix of Joe's "All Or Nothing" single from his 1994 album of the same name called the Georgy Porgy remix.  In 2009 a rearranged instrumental rendition was also done by Japanese artist DJ Deckstream[5] on his Music Castle album.[6]   "Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976\, allowance is made for "fair use" for purposes such as criticism\, comment\, news reporting\, teaching\, scholarship\, and research.

COL title VAL Candy Says COL performer VAL Seagull Screaming Kiss Her Kiss Her	COL video title VAL The Charlie Daniels Band - Pride And Joy.wmv COL description VAL Tailgate Party This CD contains some of the greatest rock songs of all time. Originally made legendary by some of the south's best rock bands\, Charlie adds his own unique sound to each song. Originals\, live and studio versions make this collection live up to its' name by being a great one to pull out during a "Tailgate Party."   Description      13 Tracks previously released in 1999     Engineered\, Produced and Mixed by: Ron W. Griffin     Executive Producer: David Corlew  Guide Review - Charlie Daniels Band - Tailgate Party  Included on this very southern rock flavored collection are live versions of "The Legend of Wooley Swamp" and "The Devil Went Down to Georgia." With both songs being so well known and played a gazillion times\, it was refreshing to hear them live and just slightly different from what we are normally accustomed to.  "The South's Gonna Do It Again" had an added bonus to it by having a very early on in his career performance by Keith Urban\, showing us some very impressive guitar solo's. Remakes of ZZ Top's "Sharp Dressed Man" and Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Freebird" were very captivating and showed off some incredible fiddle playing by Charlie. Probably one of my most favorites was CDB's remake of the song made famous by Hootie and the Blowfish\, "Let Her Cry." Charlie has always been well known for his playing but under rated for his vocals. This song shows off just how well he can deliver some very heartfelt emotions and I really enjoyed listening to this new version.  If you have ever appreciated CDB\, you will really like this release. If for nothing else\, the diversity of the genre's and CDB being able to add the country sound without destroying the memory of the song.

Between 1921 and 1935 many musicians joined and left the California Ramblers including the famous Dorsey Brothers and the very eccentric\, Jack Purvis (trombone and trumpet)\, who is said to have trashed and burned hotel rooms\, flown as a soldier of fortune\, played 52nd St.\, scored music for full orchestra\, and eventually led a prison band. Other members included Adrian Rollini (bass sax and xylophone)\, Fud Livingston and Bobby Davis (saxophones)\, and Chelsea Quealey.     During the 1920s the band was so in demand that they purchased a hotel on Pelham Parkway in the Bronx where they lived\, practiced\, and performed\, and dubbed it the Ramblers Inn. They went on to play some of the greatest clubs in New York City including the Rainbow Room at the top of the Rockefeller Center.     The original recordings made here were all “acoustical” 78s and interestingly\, recorded prior to the introduction of the microphone in 1925.     Although the music has been all but lost in our modern society\, it is my hope that these remastered jewels plucked from of our early American traditions will now live on into the 21st century and beyond.

COL title VAL The Longest Time COL performer VAL Vocal Evolution	COL video title VAL The Four Tunes I Sold My Heart To The Junkman Jubilee  5174 A COL description VAL DISCLAIMER: All rights reserved to the production companies and music labels that distributed and produced the music and performance respectively. I've only added the footage as a tribute for historical\, entertainment\, and creative purposes with no financial gain. Copyright infringement not intended.  The Four Tunes "I Sold My Heart To The Junkman" Jubilee 5174 A 1954  Here are The Four Tunes with their version of "I Sold My Heart To The Junkman." This is the 2nd pressing that was released in 1954 by Jubilee\, in the same year as the 1st pressing. A nice\, minty\, clean 78 for your enjoyment.  The 4 Tunes were probably the leading black Pop vocal group during the 1950s. Their origins can be traced back to a change of personnel in the Ink Spots. This requires a brief review of some events in the mid-40s. In June 1944\, during an engagement in Chicago\, Hoppy Jones became ill and the group had to finish a tour without him (Deek Watson filled in on the mandatory talking parts). This had unsuspected ramifications. Hoppy was the conciliatory father figure (nicknamed "the grand old man") of the Ink Spots. Now that he was missing\, infighting between Bill Kenny and Deek Watson\, which had formerly just smoldered\, now flared up unchecked. Deek had been the leader of the group until their 1939 smash of "If I Didn't Care." Since then\, Bill had firmly established himself in the forefront of the Ink Spots\, pushing Deek further and further into the background. Hoppy returned in August\, but by then\, the damage had been done.  When he announced (in the January 1945 settlement of the lawsuits) that he would form a new group based "on a completely new idea\," he simply changed their name to the "Brown Dots" (the name does sound somewhat familiar\, doesn't it?). As it turned out\, the "new idea" was to sound as much like the Ink Spots as possible. One real difference was that the Brown Dots relied more on harmony than the Ink Spots\, who were more individualists. (Since the Brown Dots were also managed by Moe Gale\, we know who the hands-down winner in this contest was.)  The polished style of the 4 Tunes was the product of their training\, experience\, dedication\, and discipline. Their songs were carefully selected and arranged. Their first arranger was pianist Ralph Herman\, who was the youngest member of Paul Whiteman's Orchestra. They also worked with Howard Biggs (whose most famous association was with the Ravens).  In mid-1953\, they once again changed labels (since they weren't making any royalties from RCA). This time they went to Jerry Blaine's Jubilee label\, where they achieved their greatest popularity. Their first Jubilee recording\, "Marie\," was released in September\, and reached #2 on the R&B charts (#13 Pop). This Irving Berlin tune had been a #1 smash for Tommy Dorsey (Jack Leonard on vocal) back in 1937. ("Marie" was such a big hit that the purely R&B Dominoes and Larks were pushed to sing in the same kind of Pop mold.) Their next Jubilee release\, "I Understand Just How You Feel" was an even bigger hit\, climbing to #6 on the Pop charts (#7 R&B).  1954 saw two releases on the Kay-Ron label. These were old Manor cuts (although different takes). Two of them were backups to Savannah Churchill ("Savannah Sings The Blues" and "I Want To Be Loved"). The other two were "Just In Case You Change Your Mind" (which was actually by the Brown Dots) and "I Understand" (which was presumably released to confuse record buyers into thinking it was the same song as the current "I Understand Just How You Feel").  On Jubilee\, the 4 Tunes were primarily a Pop group (although they did turn out something called "Rock N Roll Call"). Their output included "Don't Cry Darling\," "L'amour\, Toujours L'amour\," "I Sold My Heart To The Junkman\," "Time Out For Tears\," "You Are My Love\," "Far Away Places\," "Dancing With Tears In My Eyes\," "Sayonara\," and "A Little On The Lonely Side."  The 4 Tunes appeared for a week at the Apollo Theater (beginning April 2\, 1955)\, along with Red Prysock's Orchestra. They played both the black theater circuit and also many white clubs. When they were on a tour with Joni James\, she asked Jimmie Nabbie to write a song for her. The result\, "You Are My Love\," was her big hit of 1955 (which the 4 Tunes covered).  In 1955\, the 4 Tunes were booked into the Hacienda in Las Vegas on a handshake\, and stayed for eight years. Other members\, added at the time\, were Smiley Hightower (guitar and bassist) and Eddie Williams (bassist; formerly of Johnny Moore's Three Blazers). Also\, tenor Billy Wells (from Deek's second Brown Dots group) was hired so that each of the other members could go on vacation on a rotating basis.

She grew up with her parents and three siblings\, where it was her father who introduced her to the music when she was 10 years old. He was a musician himself. When she was 14\, her great love and Suzi Quatro became her great role model. The school's orchestra became her first gambling arena.  As an 18-year-old girl\, she began to sing and play professionally with a Bulgarian band. where they played around at the Black Sea tourist spots. She eventually got a lot of experience and got a job in a variety show.  Russia became the next venue. She also got to play for the Bulgarian president twice. In 1991 she came to Norway for the first time with "Smile Band". They played together for 15 years\, all over Norway and Europe. They had many great experiences together\, as when in 2001 she was singing and playing with one of her favorites\, Bonnie Taylor. She gave her a compliment\, which she will forever remember; “You sound more like me than I do”!   In 2003\, "Smile Band" broke up\, and Valentina started playing around as a troubadour. At Oset 2006\, she had the pleasure of meeting Bobby Bare. He invited her up on the stage and they sang and played together. It was a dream to stand in front of so many people singing. She also met Pam Tillis and Paul Young and the joy was also great when she got to play and sing along with Lynn Anderson In 2007 she released her first CD "Why not me". It sold over 16\,000 copies and the first gold plate was hung on the wall.  Now the second CD is finished\, "Comin` down the road"\, where Valentina is even stronger in her genre country-pop-rock. She has also included Stephen Ackles on a duet\, "To a tear becomes a rose"  #Valentina #QueenOfHearts# #CountryClassic #RonjasCountryMusic #RonjaGM COL channel name VAL RonjaGM	0

Entre su debut en el mundo de la música en 1945 y 1954\, Eddie logró 58 top ten consecutivos\, y nunca marcó menos de un top 40 durante sus 21 años de carrera\, con más de 140 discos diferentes de los cuales se vendieron más de 85 millones de copias\, incluidos eternos clásicos como Bouquet de Rosas o Anytime. Recibió el apodo de Tennessee Plowboy (el chico del arado de Tennessee en inglés)\, y firmó contratos con las compañías discográficas RCA Records y MGM Records.  Richard Edward Arnold nació en Henderson\, en el condado de Chester\, estado de Tennessee\, el 15 de mayo de 1918 y se educó en el medio rural. Su padre era un violinista que alentó a su hijo respecto del desarrollo de sus talentos musicales y logró reunir el dinero suficiente para comprar a su niño una guitarra a la edad de 10 años. Para cuando entró en la escuela secundaria Eddie Arnols ya era toda una estrella local\, pero con la llegada de la Gran Depresión en 1929 y la crisis económica de los años 1930\, Eddy tuvo que dejar la escuela para ayudar trabajar como asistente en una funeraria. Relegó sus actuaciones musicales a funciones locales\, aunque de vez en cuando viajaba montado en una mula con su guitarra a la espalda.  Al igual que otros artistas del country de la época\, Eddy consiguió su pase al estrellato con sus apariciones en vivo por la radio\, antes de debutar en Jackson\, en Tennessee\, en 1936 y posteriormente en San Luis\, en el estado de Misuri.  Entre 1940 y 1943 apareció en el Grand Ole Opry junto a Pee Wee King. Apodado como el chico del arado de Tennessee (o Tennessee Plowboy\, en inglés) firmó con la RCA Victor Records un contrato en 1944 con ese nombre\, que fue el que apareció en sus discos hasta 1954. Con el tema Every hour Seems A Million Years alcanzó el quinto disco de su carrera\, dando con dicho disco comienzo a la cadena de 58 consecutivos éxitos top ten. En 1947 Arnold logró sus tres primeros éxitos número uno\, siendo uno de ellos número uno durante 21 semanas. Eddy Arnold realizó temas universalmente populares convirtiéndose en una estrella perenne\, grabando discos durante un período de cinco décadas\, desde los años 1960 hasta los años 1980; tras una pausa de siete años incluso regresó al estudio en 1990.  Además de establecer un nivel inigualable dada su avanzada edad\, Arnold se convirtió en un ejemplo de cómo manejar su fortuna en el mundo del espectáculo. "Guardo mi primer dólar y sigo ahorrando e invirtiendo mi dinero"\, recuerda\, "nunca olvidé cómo se sentía ser pobre"\, añadió. Eddie Anold se convirtió en uno de los hombres más ricos de la industria mediante la inversión en la única cosa que él consideraba de valor de propiedad\, "la tierra". Debido a su enorme popularidad musical Eddy Arnold se convirtió en un auténtico embajador de la música country a nivel mundial   Spotify:http://open.spotify.com/album/4tQOsxLgCwxPCRNS5LeWxN iTunes:http://itunes.apple.com/es/album/vintage-country-no-11-ep-all/id374306958 Síguenos en: Spotify: https://goo.gl/raouHQ Facebook: https://goo.gl/L92BHL Instagram: https://goo.gl/3oYDGH Web: http://www.vintagemusic.es   Compra nuestros Cd's en formato físico en estas plataformas: Ebay:  http://stores.ebay.com/VintageMusicFm BoutiqAlia: www.boutiqalia-vintagemusic.com Discogs: https://www.discogs.com/es/seller/vintagemusicfm/profile COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm	0

Finds a streetlight\, steps out of the shade Says something like\, "You and me babe\, how about it?"  Juliet says\, "Hey\, it's Romeo\, you nearly gave me a heart attack!" He's underneath the window\, she's singing\, "Hey la\, my boyfriend's back. You shouldn't come around here singing up to people like that... Anyway\, what you gonna do about it?"  ROMEO: Juliet\, the dice was loaded from the start And I bet when you exploded into my heart And I forget I forget the movie song. When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong\, Juliet?  Come up on different streets\, they're both the streets of shame. Both dirty\, both mean\, yes\, in the dream it was just the same And I dreamed your dream for you and now your dream is real. How can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals?  When you can fall for chains of silver\,  You can fall for chains of gold\, You can fall for pretty strangers  And the promises they hold. You promised me everything\, you promised me thick and thin\, yeah! Now you just say\, "Oh Romeo? Yeah\, you know I used to have a scene with him".  Juliet\, when we made love\, you used to cry. You said\, "I love you like the stars above\, I'll love you 'til I die". There's a place for us\, you know the movie song. When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong\, Juliet?  I can't do the talk\, like the talk on TV And I can't do a love song\, like the way it's meant to be. I can't do everything\, but I'll do anything for you. I can't do anything\, 'cept be in love with you! And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be. All I do is keep the beat... and bad company. Now all I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme\, Juliet\, I'd do the stars with you any time!  Juliet\, when we made love you used to cry. You said\, "I love you like the stars above\, I'll love you 'til I die". There's a place for us\, you know the movie song. When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong\, Juliet?

COL title VAL Why COL performer VAL Keith Caputo	COL video title VAL Peggy Lee - He's My Guy COL description VAL Peggy Lee's alluring tone\, distinctive delivery\, breadth of material\, and ability to write many of her own songs made her one of the most captivating artists of the vocal era\, from her breakthrough on the Benny Goodman hit "Why Don't You Do Right" to her many solo successes\, singles including "Mañana\," "Lover" and "Fever" that showed her bewitching vocal power\, a balance between sultry swing and impeccable musicianship.  Born Norma Egstrom in Jamestown\, North Dakota\, she suffered the death of her mother at the age of four and endured a difficult stepmother after her father remarried. Given her sense of swing by listening to Count Basie on the radio\, she taught herself to sing and made her radio debut at the age of 14. She made the jump to Fargo (where she was christened Peggy Lee)\, then to Minneapolis and St. Louis to sing with a regional band. Lee twice journeyed to Hollywood to make her fortune\, but returned unsuccessful from both trips.  She finally got her big break in 1941\, when a vocal group she worked with began appearing at a club in Chicago. While there\, she was heard by Benny Goodman\, whose regular vocalist Helen Forrest was about to leave his band. Lee recorded with Goodman just a few days later\, debuting with the popular "Elmer's Tune" despite a good deal of nerves. That same year\, several songs became commercial successes including "I Got It Bad (And That Ain't Good)" and "Winter Weather." In 1943\, "Why Don't You Do Right" became her first major hit\, but she left the Goodman band (and the music industry altogether) later that year after marrying Goodman's guitarist\, Dave Barbour.  After just over a year of domestic life\, Peggy Lee returned to music\, first as part of an all-star jazz album. Then\, in late 1945\, Capitol signed her to a solo contract and she hit the charts with her first shot\, "Waitin' for the Train to Come In." Lee continued to score during the late '40s\, with over two dozen chart entries before the end of the decade\, including "It's a Good Day\," "Mañana (Is Soon Enough for Me)" -- the most popular song of 1948 -- and "I Don't Know Enough About You." Many of her singles were done in conjunction with Barbour\, her frequent writing and recording partner.  After moving to Decca in 1952\, Peggy Lee scored with the single "Lover" and an LP\, Songs From Pete Kelly's Blues recorded with Ella Fitzgerald (both singers also made appearances in the film). She spent only five years at Decca however\, before moving back to Capitol. There\, she distinguished herself through recording a wide variety of material\, including songs -- and occasionally\, entire LPs -- influenced by the blues\, Latin and cabaret as well as pop. Lee also used many different settings\, like an orchestra conducted by none other than Frank Sinatra for 1957's The Man I Love\, the George Shearing Quintet for 1959's live appearance Beauty and the Beat\, Quincey Jones as arranger and conductor for 1961's If You Go\, and arrangements by Benny Carter on 1963's Mink Jazz. Barbour's problems with alcoholism ended their marriage\, though they remained good friends until his death in 1965.  Peggy Lee was an early advocate of rock and made a quick transition into rock-oriented material. Given her depth and open mind for great songs no matter the source\, it wasn't much of a surprise that she sounded quite comfortable covering the more song-oriented end of late-'60s rock\, including great choices by Jimmy Webb\, Buffy Sainte-Marie\, Burt Bacharach\, Randy Newman\, Goffin & King and John Sebastian. She nearly brushed the Top Ten in 1969 with Leiber & Stoller's "Is That All There Is?" She continued recording contemporary material until 1972's Norma Deloris Egstrom From Jamestown\, North Dakota brought her back to her roots. It was her last LP for Capitol\, however. Lee recorded single LPs for Atlantic\, A&M\, Polydor UK and DRG before effectively retiring at the beginning of the 1980s. She returned in 1988 with two LPs for Music Masters that revisited her earlier successes. Her last album\, Moments Like This\, was recorded in 1992 for Chesky. Her voice was effectively silenced after a 1998 stroke\, and she died of a heart attack at her Bel Air home in early 2002. ~ John Bush\, All Music Guide  PLEASE NOTE:  I divided my uploads among multiple channels\,  Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

I am in love.  I knew the odds were against me before\, I had no flair for flaming desire\, But since the gods gave me you to adore\, I may lose but I refuse to fight the fire\,  So come and enlighten my days and never depart. You only can brighten the blaze that burns in my heart\, For I am wildly in love with you\, and so in need of a stampede of love.

She grew up with her parents and three siblings\, where it was her father who introduced her to the music when she was 10 years old. He was a musician himself. When she was 14\, her great love and Suzi Quatro became her great role model. The school's orchestra became her first gambling arena.  As an 18-year-old girl\, she began to sing and play professionally with a Bulgarian band. where they played around at the Black Sea tourist spots. She eventually got a lot of experience and got a job in a variety show.  Russia became the next venue. She also got to play for the Bulgarian president twice. In 1991 she came to Norway for the first time with "Smile Band". They played together for 15 years\, all over Norway and Europe. They had many great experiences together\, as when in 2001 she was singing and playing with one of her favorites\, Bonnie Taylor. She gave her a compliment\, which she will forever remember; “You sound more like me than I do”!   In 2003\, "Smile Band" broke up\, and Valentina started playing around as a troubadour. At Oset 2006\, she had the pleasure of meeting Bobby Bare. He invited her up on the stage and they sang and played together. It was a dream to stand in front of so many people singing. She also met Pam Tillis and Paul Young and the joy was also great when she got to play and sing along with Lynn Anderson In 2007 she released her first CD "Why not me". It sold over 16\,000 copies and the first gold plate was hung on the wall.  Now the second CD is finished\, "Comin` down the road"\, where Valentina is even stronger in her genre country-pop-rock. She has also included Stephen Ackles on a duet\, "To a tear becomes a rose"  #Valentina #QueenOfHearts# #CountryClassic #RonjasCountryMusic #RonjaGM COL channel name VAL RonjaGM	0

In her three-decade long career as a solo artist\, Made in Brazil results from the first time she’s recorded a disc in her native Brazil since moving to the United States in 1981. (International release dates may vary)  Elias wears many hats on this project as producer\, composer\, lyricist\, arranger\, pianist and vocalist. “I am completely immersed and involved in every single detail of the music and the recording process\, from the birth of an idea until its completion through every aspect of the production until it reaches the public\,” she explains.  Along with co-producers\, Steve Rodby and Marc Johnson\, her bass playing musical partner\, Elias ventured ‘home’ and recruited a splendid cast of Brazilian musicians that include electric bassist Marcelo Mariano; guitarists Marcus Teixeira and Roberto Menescal; drummers Edu Ribeiro and Rafael Barata; and percussionists Mauro Refosco and Marivaldo dos Santos.  Elias peppered the sessions with delightful special guest performances from Mark Kibble and the multi-GRAMMY® Award-winning gospel vocal group Take 6; her singer/songwriter-daughter Amanda Brecker; one of Brazil’s most celebrated R&B stars\, Ed Motta; and the distinguished bossa nova composer Roberto Menescal.  Elias also invited Rob Mathes to handle orchestral arrangements on seven of the 12 tracks\, which were recorded in London at the legendary Abbey Road Studios. “It’s so touching to hear the music unfold\,” she says of the orchestral arrangements after they were overdubbed onto the São Paulo sessions. “You can see the musical notes on paper\, but it’s something else to hear them realized and performed by members of the London Symphonic Orchestra.” COL channel name VAL Concord Records	1

Alfonzo was a great singer\, with some good songs\, but to my opinion\, they should have launched him as an artist in his own right and not just a copycat of Michal Jackson. This last fact was surely true for his looks. Sadly enough he faded away from the scene\, maybe a wrong choice of managment or something like that. He was a great singer! This song is an absolutely favourite of mine! Anyone knows what happend to him? COL channel name VAL peterpiessens	0

COL title VAL I Ran COL performer VAL Love Is All	COL video title VAL Maddox Brothers & Rose - No Help Wanted COL description VAL The Maddox Brothers and Rose\, known as America's Most Colorful Hillbilly Band from the 1930s to the 1950s\, consisted of four brothers\, Fred\, Cal\, Cliff and Don Maddox\, along with their sister Rose. Cliff died in 1949 and was replaced by brother Henry. The group disbanded in 1956.  The family hailed from Boaz\, Alabama\, but rode the rails and hitch hiked to California in 1933 when the band members were still children\, following the failed efforts of their sharecropper parents during the early part of the Depression. They were a little in advance of the flood of Okies who were to flood the state in the 30s. They struggled to make a living as intinerant fruit and vegetable pickers following the harvest as far north as Washington state\, and as far east as Arizona\, as well as in the San Joaquin Valley. They often worked from dawn to dusk\, sleeping and eating on the ground.  Having settled in Modesto\, the family developed their musical ability and\, in 1937 performed on the radio\, sponsored by a local furniture store. In 1939 they entered a hillbilly band competition at the centenial Sacramento State Fair after driving to Sacramento in their Model A. When they took the stage they tore through "Sally Let Your Bangs Hang Down" with rocking rhythms and risque lyrics. They became\, officially\, California's best hillbilly band.  The brothers and Rose appeared at places such as the 97th Street Corral in Los Angles.  From 1946-1951 the group recorded for 4 Star Records (Hollywood)\, then for Columbia Records. Some 4 Star masters were leased and released by US.-Decca Records at the beginning of the 1950s. The following quotes are from Rose Maddox. "We were called hillbilly singers - not country - then. No\, none of this country music then. People just called us hillbilly... People tell me that I was one of the first women to sing what I sang - country boogie. I guess I was. There was no rock 'n' roll in those early days\, before 1955. Only country boogie. My brothers also played that way. We called it country then.  The Maddox's material ranged from the country standards of Hank Williams and Merle Travis\, cowboy songs\, to the Western swing of Bob Wills\, to old-time\, folk\, and church singing\, to jazz\, swing\, boogie woogie and even a taste of early rock and roll.  Fred Maddox played upright bass using the "slap bass" technique as early as 1937.[5] This trademark backbeat\, a slapping bass style\, helped drive a broad change in popular music\, sporting a faster\, immediately discernible rhythm that came to be known as rockabilly.  Fred Maddox's bass is displayed at the Experience Music Project in Seattle. "They wanted his bass because they believe he might have hit the first note of rock 'n' roll on it.

Dette er en sang som jeg liker veldig godt og som betyr veldig mye for meg. ___________________________________  Ja fysst så vil je nevne min stilling og min stæinn\, je står og svarver hatter i Salomo sitt læinn. Sjøl bær je navnet Jørgen\, så skilnaden er stor\, men både je og Salomo kom nakne tel vår jord.  Refr.:  Sola skin på deg så skuggen fell på meg men graset er grønt for æille.  Når liljene på marken i fager blomstring står\, og alle himlens fugler sin glade trille slår\, je nynne såmmå strofa i hattemakergrenn\, og morgendagen\, Salomo\, hva vet vel vi om den?  Refr.  Har Salomo sitt måltid med vin og fylte fat\, je sug på harde skorper og kæille det for mat\, men det vi gir ifrå øss di vi i lønndom går blir gras til hyrdens hvite lam og Sarons sorte får.  Refr.  Når dronningen av Saba gjør Salomo visitt\, je ser a "Lea Lettvint" og hu har tenkt seg hit. Om leiet blir forskjellig frå silkeseng tel strå\, vi går mot såmmå paradis og hører harper slå.  Refr.  Når sola synk og dale bak slottets tårn og tind\, så kjæm den mørke natta med drøm og tankespinn\, der blir je sjøl Kong Salomo og hæin blir kænskje den som står og svarver hatter uti hattemakergrenn.

Shaw\, who was born in Leicester attended the Trinity College of Music and served in the Royal Air Force in World War II leading RAF No 1 Band of the Middle East Forces. Following wartime service he arranged music for Ted Heath\, Teddy Foster\, Mantovani and many others.

In December 1964 his orchestra released an album of cover versions of Themes from the James Bond Thrillers to coincide with the American release of Goldfinger. The popularity of Shaw's arrangements of Bond themes led to More Themes from the James Bond Thrillers for the release ofThunderball with tracks from both albums released on a UK album called James Bond in Action. In 1966 Shaw's orchestra performed Themes for Secret Agents.Themes from the James Bond Thrillers Vol.3/More James Bond in Action followed the release of Casino Royale and You Only Live Twice in 1967. Shaw came back in 1971 for The Return of James Bond/The Phase 4 World of Spy Thrillers for the release of Sean Connery's return as Bond in Diamonds Are Forever. Shaw recruited guitarist Vic Flick to repeat his guitar playing on the Gypsy Camp track. Shaw arranged music for films such as Summer Holiday (1963) and The Secret of My Success (1965) and wrote the score for Straight on Till Morning.

The great songwriting team\, which had already produced dozens of hit songs that would go on to become standards — including The Look of Love\, Walk On By and I Say a Little Prayer — reinvigorated musical theatre with an energizing score.  Burt Bacharach has had 47 top ten hits and nine #1 songs. He's the recipient of three Academy Awards and six Grammys\, and is an inductee into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Promises\, Promises ran for over 1200 performances\, won two Tony Awards\, and was the recipient of a Grammy Award.

Happy Happy Birthday Baby is one of my favorite songs by Diane. I met her in 1963 when I was 12 years old in Downtown Gastonia. I was very impressed by her and she gave Gastonia a lot of recognition at the time of her record release. Her first song was "Please Don't Talk To The Lifeguard" and the song was continuously played on the radio with moderate success. There was a popular radio station 'WGAS" in Gastonia\, NC that played her album songs every hour on the hour to promote "The Exciting Years" and most of us had her album also. Hope you enjoy the song and slideshow. COL channel name VAL David Carpenter	0

COL title VAL Take Me in Your Arms COL performer VAL Blood\, Sweat & Tears	COL video title VAL "Motown Classics" "Kim Weston Take Me In Your Arms (Rock Me A Little While) Alternate Version" COL description VAL "This is an alternate vocal take of the classic Motown hit\, "Take Me In Your Arms (Rock Me A Little While)"  "Kim Weston- ask any avid Motown fan\, the ones REALLY additcted to the label's music\, about Kim Weston and I'll make a bet that 100% of them will tell you Motown REALLY dropped the ball on a phenomenal talent...  Here is an alternate version of perhaps Kim's best-known song for the company (at least\, best-known to the public in general.)     Take Me In Your Arms (Rock Me A Little While) was a firestorm that came from the forever-astonishing team of Holland-Dozier-Holland.  Eddie Holland actually put his vocals down first.  Notes from the Kim Weston Motown Anthology state that the song was slated for Martha and the Vandellas.  The song was then assigned to Kim\, and Motown's studio A caught fire and disintigrated.  How the studio didn't burn to the ground as this woman lit fire to the already-burning H-D-H track is a mystery.  The commercial version certainly was a firecracker but this alternate version recently released...  fire alarms will sound\,  walls will crumble\,  speakers will explode\,  you'll be turned into ashes.  I don't know\, maybe Kim decided to just give it hell\, maybe H-D-H wanted one more take and Kim was tired and decided if they wanted one more take\, then she would give them something they'd never forget.  Whatever factored into this take\, Kim takes the vocals to asonishingly explosive heights and hits notes that must have brought down any and all aircraft flying in the vicinity of Hitsville U.S.A.  Notice too her lightning-fast phrasing going into the choruses  (almost like those triple-time raps hip hop artists pull of so easily today.)    People must have really been paying attention to this song because the Doobie Brothers did a cover of the song that accomplished the fantastic feat of sounding thouroughly like a Doobie Brothers original and yet keeping a lot of that fantastic\, classic Motown Sound at the same time.    Kim Weston was a woman who was able to shift gears easily between the Motown Sound and ballads and standards.  Wonderfully\, there have been recent releases on cd to showcase all of her amazing recordings as well as the ones that were kept in the vaults.  Here is just one of those tracks that were kept behind\, so enjoy and keep the fire extinguisher nearby!  Special notice should be given to Benny Benjamin's explosive drumming on this song.  I don't know the correct term for it\, but to me it's like a double-time swing beat.  To keep that beat in perfect time is amazing enough\, but to toss in those trademark Benjamin drum fills is almost unbelievable. I don't know of anyone else who could toss those fills in and make it sound so easy."  also: "it takes two marvin gaye and kim weston" "kim weston helpless" "the doobie brothers take me in your arms (rock me a little while)"  "Greatest Motown Songs Of All Time - Motown Classic Songs Playlist - Best Motown Music Hits 60's Kim Weston Songs  Motown Songs" COL channel name VAL Motown Deep Cuts\, PAMS Jingles & More with Tomovox	1

Otto canzoni\, in gran parte cover\, in cui la voce del "nero a metà" della musica napoletana si rivela in tutta la sua carismatica espressività. Un album sospeso tra rhythm'n'blues\, rock'n'roll e tanto soul in cui spicca la presenza di alcuni "turnisti" d'eccezione che rispondono ai nomi di Pino Daniele e Enzo Avitabile. Di grande intensità le riletture di "Arrivederci"\, il capolavoro di Umberto Bindi che dà giustamente il titolo al disco; assolutamente trascinante l'interpretazione di "True fine mama" di Little Richards ; decisamente eleganti le rarefatte atmosfere della celeberrima "Giorgia on my mind" di Ray Charles" e di "Entriamo nel gioco"\, versione italiana di quella "You make me feel a brand new" portata al successo dai Simply Red" vent'anni dopo.  Ancor prima di essere un eccezionale documento storico\, "Arriverdeci" è un album che testimonia alla perfezione la grandezza di un interprete come non ce ne sono stati più.

COL title VAL Mister Magic COL performer VAL Kellee Patterson	COL video title VAL Mister Magic - Grover Washington\, Jr. (1974) COL description VAL "Mister Magic" was the successful single and title track from the fifth album of one of jazz music's more well-known figures.  Grover Washington\, Jr. (December 12\, 1943 -- December 17\, 1999) was an American jazz-funk / soul-jazz saxophonist.  Along with George Benson\, John Klemmer\, David Sanborn\, Bob James\, Chuck Mangione\, Herb Alpert\, and Spyro Gyra\, he is considered by many to be one of the founders of the smooth jazz genre.  He wrote some of his material and later became an arranger and producer.  Washington was born in Buffalo\, New York on December 12\, 1943.  His mother was a church chorister\, and his father was a collector of old jazz gramophone records and a saxophonist as well\, so music was everywhere in the home.  He grew up with the great jazzmen and big band leaders like Benny Goodman\, Fletcher Henderson\, and others like them.  At the age of 8\, with the desire for him to be more than he could be\, Grover Sr. gave Jr. a saxophone.  He practiced and would sneak into clubs to see famous Buffalo blues musicians.  Washington left Buffalo and played with a Midwest group called the Four Clefs.  He was drafted into the U.S. Army shortly thereafter\, but this was to be to his advantage\, as he met drummer Billy Cobham there.  Cobham\, a mainstay in New York City\, introduced Washington to many New York musicians.  After leaving the Army\, Washington freelanced his talents around New York City\, eventually landing in Philadelphia in 1967.  In 1970 and 1971\, he appeared on Leon Spencer's first two albums on Prestige Records\, together with Idris Muhammad and Melvin Sparks.  Washington's big break came at the expense of another artist.  Alto sax man Hank Crawford was unable to make a recording date with Creed Taylor's Kudu Records\, and Washington took his place\, even though he was a backup.  This led to his first solo album\, "Inner City Blues".  He was talented and displayed heart and soul with soprano\, alto\, tenor\, and baritone saxophones.  Refreshing for his time\, he made headway into the jazz mainstream.  His fifth album\, 1974's "Mister Magic"\, was a commercial success\, and introduced guitarist Eric Gale as a near-permanent member in Washington's arsenal.  Throughout the 1970s and 1980s\, Washington made some of the genre's most memorable hits\, including "Mr. Magic" and "Black Frost.  In addition\, he performed very frequently with other artists\, including Bill Withers on "Just The Two Of Us" (still in regular rotation on radio today)\, Patti LaBelle on "The Best Is Yet To Come" and Phyllis Hyman on "A Sacred Kind Of Love".  He is also remembered for his take on the Dave Brubeck classic "Take Five"\, and for his 1996 version of "Soulful Strut".  On December 17\, 1999\, while waiting in the green room after taping four songs for "The Saturday Early Show" at CBS Studios in New York City\, Washington collapsed.  He was taken to St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital\, where he was pronounced dead at about 7:30 p.m.  He was 56 years old.  His doctors determined that he had suffered a massive heart attack.

I'm still not sure what to make of same sex marriage. I am a stout conservative however I believe that people should be free to share their lives with whom they wish or fall in love with regardless of sexual barriers and live it as they see fit as long as harm is not brought to others\, judgments I leave to God\, that is regarding that my rights are not encroached upon by the rights of others.  This being said I do believe that if not marriage as defined between a men and a woman there should be similar laws that protect and gives the proper rights to any two persons who form a serious home and a relationship together.  I do have friends who are in such relationships\, I do not condone discrimination based on sexual preferences and to them I dedicate this record by the great Charles Aznavour\,  it tells a touching and very lonely story.

Que j'me démène ou qu'je reste coi Je passe pour un je-ne-sais-quoi  Je ne fais pourtant de tort à  personne En suivant mon chemin de petit bonhomme. Mais les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Non les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Tout le monde médit de moi\, Sauf les muets\, ça va de soi.  Le jour du Quatorze Juillet Je reste dans mon lit douillet. La musique qui marche au pas\, Cela ne me regarde pas.  Je ne fais pourtant de tort à  personne\, En n'écoutant pas le clairon qui sonne. Mais les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Non les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Tout le monde me montre du doigt Sauf les manchots\, ça va de soi.  Quand j'croise un voleur malchanceux\, Poursuivi par un cul-terreux; J'lance la patte et pourquoi le taire\, Le cul-terreux s'retrouve par terre  Je ne fais pourtant de tort à  personne\, En laissant courir les voleurs de pommes. Mais les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Non les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Tout le monde se rue sur moi\, Sauf les culs-de-jatte\, ça va de soi.  Pas besoin d'être Jérémie\, Pour d'viner l'sort qui m'est promis\, S'ils trouvent une corde à  leur goût\, Ils me la passeront au cou\,  Je ne fais pourtant de tort à  personne\, En suivant les ch'mins qui n'mènent pas à  Rome\, Mais les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Non les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Tout l'mond' viendra me voir pendu\, Sauf les aveugles\, bien entendu.

COL title VAL You Talk Too Much COL performer VAL Ricardo Ray Orchestra	COL video title VAL Peggy Lee - He's My Guy COL description VAL Peggy Lee's alluring tone\, distinctive delivery\, breadth of material\, and ability to write many of her own songs made her one of the most captivating artists of the vocal era\, from her breakthrough on the Benny Goodman hit "Why Don't You Do Right" to her many solo successes\, singles including "Mañana\," "Lover" and "Fever" that showed her bewitching vocal power\, a balance between sultry swing and impeccable musicianship.  Born Norma Egstrom in Jamestown\, North Dakota\, she suffered the death of her mother at the age of four and endured a difficult stepmother after her father remarried. Given her sense of swing by listening to Count Basie on the radio\, she taught herself to sing and made her radio debut at the age of 14. She made the jump to Fargo (where she was christened Peggy Lee)\, then to Minneapolis and St. Louis to sing with a regional band. Lee twice journeyed to Hollywood to make her fortune\, but returned unsuccessful from both trips.  She finally got her big break in 1941\, when a vocal group she worked with began appearing at a club in Chicago. While there\, she was heard by Benny Goodman\, whose regular vocalist Helen Forrest was about to leave his band. Lee recorded with Goodman just a few days later\, debuting with the popular "Elmer's Tune" despite a good deal of nerves. That same year\, several songs became commercial successes including "I Got It Bad (And That Ain't Good)" and "Winter Weather." In 1943\, "Why Don't You Do Right" became her first major hit\, but she left the Goodman band (and the music industry altogether) later that year after marrying Goodman's guitarist\, Dave Barbour.  After just over a year of domestic life\, Peggy Lee returned to music\, first as part of an all-star jazz album. Then\, in late 1945\, Capitol signed her to a solo contract and she hit the charts with her first shot\, "Waitin' for the Train to Come In." Lee continued to score during the late '40s\, with over two dozen chart entries before the end of the decade\, including "It's a Good Day\," "Mañana (Is Soon Enough for Me)" -- the most popular song of 1948 -- and "I Don't Know Enough About You." Many of her singles were done in conjunction with Barbour\, her frequent writing and recording partner.  After moving to Decca in 1952\, Peggy Lee scored with the single "Lover" and an LP\, Songs From Pete Kelly's Blues recorded with Ella Fitzgerald (both singers also made appearances in the film). She spent only five years at Decca however\, before moving back to Capitol. There\, she distinguished herself through recording a wide variety of material\, including songs -- and occasionally\, entire LPs -- influenced by the blues\, Latin and cabaret as well as pop. Lee also used many different settings\, like an orchestra conducted by none other than Frank Sinatra for 1957's The Man I Love\, the George Shearing Quintet for 1959's live appearance Beauty and the Beat\, Quincey Jones as arranger and conductor for 1961's If You Go\, and arrangements by Benny Carter on 1963's Mink Jazz. Barbour's problems with alcoholism ended their marriage\, though they remained good friends until his death in 1965.  Peggy Lee was an early advocate of rock and made a quick transition into rock-oriented material. Given her depth and open mind for great songs no matter the source\, it wasn't much of a surprise that she sounded quite comfortable covering the more song-oriented end of late-'60s rock\, including great choices by Jimmy Webb\, Buffy Sainte-Marie\, Burt Bacharach\, Randy Newman\, Goffin & King and John Sebastian. She nearly brushed the Top Ten in 1969 with Leiber & Stoller's "Is That All There Is?" She continued recording contemporary material until 1972's Norma Deloris Egstrom From Jamestown\, North Dakota brought her back to her roots. It was her last LP for Capitol\, however. Lee recorded single LPs for Atlantic\, A&M\, Polydor UK and DRG before effectively retiring at the beginning of the 1980s. She returned in 1988 with two LPs for Music Masters that revisited her earlier successes. Her last album\, Moments Like This\, was recorded in 1992 for Chesky. Her voice was effectively silenced after a 1998 stroke\, and she died of a heart attack at her Bel Air home in early 2002. ~ John Bush\, All Music Guide  PLEASE NOTE:  I divided my uploads among multiple channels\,  Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

No matter where I go I hear The beating of our one heart I think about you When the night is cold and dark\, uh-huh\, yeah No one can move me The way that you do Nothing erases this feeling between me and you\, oh  I drove all night to get to you Is that all right? I drove all night Crept in your room Woke you from your sleep To make love to you Is that all right? I drove all night  I taste your sweet kisses Your arms open wide This fever for you is just burning me up inside  I drove all night to get to you Is that all right? I drove all night Crept in your room Is that all right? I drove all night (I drove all night) I drove all night (To get to you) To get to you (Is that all right?) Is that all right?

COL title VAL Don't Forget Me COL performer VAL Neko Case	COL video title VAL Bill Keith Homestead on The Farm COL description VAL William Bradford Keith was born in Boston\, Massachusetts. He attended Amherst College and graduated in 1961. In 1963 he became a member of Bill Monroe's Bluegrass Boys.   Keith's recordings and performances during these nine months with Monroe permanently altered banjo playing\, and his style has become an important part of the playing styles of many banjoists. After leaving the Bluegrass Boys\, he joined "Jim Kweskin Jug Band" playing plectrum banjo. He began playing the steel guitar and soon after 1968\, found himself working together with Ian and Sylvia and Jonathan Edwards. In the 1970s Keith recorded for Rounder Records. Over the years he has performed with several other musicians\, such as Clarence White and David Grisman in Muleskinner\, Tony Trischka\, Jim Rooney and Jim Collier. Today\, Keith style is still regarded as modern or progressive in the context of bluegrass banjo playing.    Keith made a mechanical contribution to the banjo\, as well. He designed a specialized type of banjo tuning peg that facilitates changing quickly from one open tuning to another\, while playing. Earlier famed banjoist Earl Scruggs had designed a set of cams which were added to the banjo to perform this task. Keith's invention made the extra hardware unnecessary\, replacing two of the tuning machines already on the banjo — a more elegant solution. Scruggs himself became a partner in the venture for a while\, and the product was known as "Scruggs-Keith Pegs". Known today simply as Keith Pegs\, they remain the state of the art\, and Bill Keith continues to manufacture and market them personally as the primary product of his own company\, the Beacon Banjo Company.

COL title VAL I'm the Leader of the Gang (I Am) COL performer VAL Girlschool + Gary Glitter	COL video title VAL The Mar-Keys - Last Night COL description VAL The Mar-Keys\, formed in 1958\, were an American studio session band for the Stax label from Memphis\, Tennessee\, in the 1960s. As the first house band for the label\, their backing music formed the foundation for the early 1960s Stax sound.  The group began as The Royal Spades and had tried unsuccessfully to get a record made for the local Satellite Records even though tenor sax player Charles "Packy" Axton's mother and uncle owned that label. When they were finally able to get a record made\, Axton's mother Estelle Axton convinced the group to change their name and they chose The Mar-Keys.  They also recorded organ and saxophone oriented singles of their own\, scoring a number three hit nationally with "Last Night" in 1961. It sold over one million copies\, earning gold disc recognition. Keyboards were played by Jerry Lee "Smoochy" Smith. Other singles of theirs from the early 1960s include "Philly Dog" and "Popeye Stroll." Members of this rhythm section later formed other nationally prominent Memphis studio session groups\, including the Memphis Horns\, the Packers\, and Booker T. & the M.G.'s. Each of these offshoot groups also recorded popular instrumental albums of their own\, in addition to serving as the backing band on albums by dozens of rock\, R&B\, and soul music stars on Stax\, Volt and other national labels. The legacy of the Mar-Keys and later groups was that of having been key players in the development of soul music styles like Southern soul and Memphis soul.

COL title VAL Knowing When to Leave COL performer VAL Jill O'Hara	COL video title VAL Wayne King & His Orchestra - Goofus (1930) COL description VAL Wayne King\, born Harold Wayne King\, (February 16\, 1901  July 16\, 1985) was an American musician\, songwriter\, singer and orchestral leader. He was sometimes referred to as "the Waltz King" because most of his popular music involved waltzes; "The Waltz You Saved For Me" was his Theme Song. Born in Savanna\, Illinois\, King was an impressive athlete in high school\, and briefly played professional football with the Canton Bulldogs. He also attended Valparaiso University in Indiana for two years\, but left to begin a career in music. After playing saxophone for the Paul Whiteman Orchestra\, he created "Wayne King and Orchestra" in 1927. King's innovations included converting Carrie Jacobs-Bond's "I Love You Truly" from its original 2/4 time over to 3/4. The orchestra disbanded during World War II\, and King joined the army\, advancing to the rank of major. The orchestra was reestablished in 1946. King's orchestra had a television show in Chicago from 1949 to 1952. He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the Radio category.  In later years he operated a Black Angus cattle farm and a car rental business. In early 1958 he appeared as a guest challenger on the TV panel show "To Tell The Truth". He released a Christmas album on Decca Records\, Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\, in 1963. King's orchestra played its last engagement in March 1983 at the Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall in Sarasota\, Florida. COL channel name VAL ASACurator	0

I have a long working relationship with both Travis and J Bonner. J is brilliant reggae bass player that I’ve played with and worked with me on "Poet’s Life" and the Jimmy Cliff album. Travis is in the Transplants with me. I’m so fortunate to get to play with these guys. In the video\, there’s a shot of me standing on a garbage can on the corner of Durant and Telegraph\, in the distance you can see the church where my parents were married in 1958.

Lo que atrae de los covers como siempre e dicho\, es la curiosidad de como se escucha tal cancion con tal vocalista\, el morbo de escuchar una cancion tocada por diferentes personas.  Para disfrutar de este recopilatoria\, tienes que quitarte la imagen de como es la cancion\, no esperes algo igual o "muy parecido"\, recordemos que cada musico aporta algo que hace unica cualquier cancion\, ya sea un cover como es este caso.  Como se observa en la track list\, hay una gran variedad de musicos\, entre ellos vi a Paul Di'anno\, que como todos saben fue ex-integrante de Iron Maiden\, no podian faltar Lemmy o Ripper\, tambien veo a chuck de testament\, tambien esta Chris Jericho de WWE que la neta yo ni sabia que tenia una banda.  En fin hay para todos los gustos\, lo unico malo que vi en el disco es que faltaron algunos temas. COL channel name VAL el juanito	0

With very different vocal tones and style\, Beccy and Melinda do great justice to a generous amount of iconic tracks on their duet album. I chose this recording\, as the best known (although not the original) version by Juice Newton is pretty hard to top. but these two ladies give it a red hot go! I love the unique qualities they bring to this set\, and they seem to be having a great old time doing it\, as well. They filmed a very cute vid for their version of '9 to 5' - check it out - it gives people a sense of the performers and their great approach. Melinda is the daughter of yodelling superstar Mary Schneider\, and Beccy's mum Carole Sturtzel was regarded as the Queen of Country Music in South Australia. For me it is a lovely opportunity here to be able to post a clip of these two wonderful daughters and celebrate the terrific careers they have both carved out for themselves. Both have multiple Golden Guitar awards (Australia's Country Music Prizes) and have scored many hits from their already prolific catalogues.   Happy Mother's Day to all the wonderful Mums out there.

COL title VAL Quei piccoli niente COL performer VAL Giangilberto Monti	COL video title VAL The California Ramblers - "My Honey's Lovin Arms" COL description VAL The California Ramblers ~ 1921-23  hi-def recording  Frank Cush - violin / director Bill Moore – trumpet Lloyd “Ole” Olsen – trombone Jimmy Duff – clarinet / alto sax Freddy Cusick – tenor sax Adrian Rollini – bass sax / xylophone Ed Sutton\, Joe LaFarro\, Sid Harris\, violin Irving Broadsky – piano Ray Kitchingman – banjo Fred Henry – drums     The California Ramblers were to become one of the most prolifically recorded society bands of the early 20th century; its sound styled after that of the Red Nichols variety and led mostly by Frank Cush (violin).      Between 1921 and 1935 many musicians joined and left the California Ramblers including the famous Dorsey Brothers and the very eccentric\, Jack Purvis (trombone and trumpet)\, who is said to have trashed and burned hotel rooms\, flown as a soldier of fortune\, played 52nd St.\, scored music for full orchestra\, and eventually led a prison band. Other members included Adrian Rollini (bass sax and xylophone)\, Fud Livingston and Bobby Davis (saxophones)\, and Chelsea Quealey.     During the 1920s the band was so in demand that they purchased a hotel on Pelham Parkway in the Bronx where they lived\, practiced\, and performed\, and dubbed it the Ramblers Inn. They went on to play some of the greatest clubs in New York City including the Rainbow Room at the top of the Rockefeller Center.     The original recordings made here were all “acoustical” 78s and interestingly\, recorded prior to the introduction of the microphone in 1925.     Although the music has been all but lost in our modern society\, it is my hope that these remastered jewels plucked from of our early American traditions will now live on into the 21st century and beyond.

In her three-decade long career as a solo artist\, Made in Brazil results from the first time she’s recorded a disc in her native Brazil since moving to the United States in 1981. (International release dates may vary)  Elias wears many hats on this project as producer\, composer\, lyricist\, arranger\, pianist and vocalist. “I am completely immersed and involved in every single detail of the music and the recording process\, from the birth of an idea until its completion through every aspect of the production until it reaches the public\,” she explains.  Along with co-producers\, Steve Rodby and Marc Johnson\, her bass playing musical partner\, Elias ventured ‘home’ and recruited a splendid cast of Brazilian musicians that include electric bassist Marcelo Mariano; guitarists Marcus Teixeira and Roberto Menescal; drummers Edu Ribeiro and Rafael Barata; and percussionists Mauro Refosco and Marivaldo dos Santos.  Elias peppered the sessions with delightful special guest performances from Mark Kibble and the multi-GRAMMY® Award-winning gospel vocal group Take 6; her singer/songwriter-daughter Amanda Brecker; one of Brazil’s most celebrated R&B stars\, Ed Motta; and the distinguished bossa nova composer Roberto Menescal.  Elias also invited Rob Mathes to handle orchestral arrangements on seven of the 12 tracks\, which were recorded in London at the legendary Abbey Road Studios. “It’s so touching to hear the music unfold\,” she says of the orchestral arrangements after they were overdubbed onto the São Paulo sessions. “You can see the musical notes on paper\, but it’s something else to hear them realized and performed by members of the London Symphonic Orchestra.” COL channel name VAL Concord Records	0

COL title VAL A Swingin Safari COL performer VAL The Clevers	COL video title VAL The California Ramblers - "My Honey's Lovin Arms" COL description VAL The California Ramblers ~ 1921-23  hi-def recording  Frank Cush - violin / director Bill Moore – trumpet Lloyd “Ole” Olsen – trombone Jimmy Duff – clarinet / alto sax Freddy Cusick – tenor sax Adrian Rollini – bass sax / xylophone Ed Sutton\, Joe LaFarro\, Sid Harris\, violin Irving Broadsky – piano Ray Kitchingman – banjo Fred Henry – drums     The California Ramblers were to become one of the most prolifically recorded society bands of the early 20th century; its sound styled after that of the Red Nichols variety and led mostly by Frank Cush (violin).      Between 1921 and 1935 many musicians joined and left the California Ramblers including the famous Dorsey Brothers and the very eccentric\, Jack Purvis (trombone and trumpet)\, who is said to have trashed and burned hotel rooms\, flown as a soldier of fortune\, played 52nd St.\, scored music for full orchestra\, and eventually led a prison band. Other members included Adrian Rollini (bass sax and xylophone)\, Fud Livingston and Bobby Davis (saxophones)\, and Chelsea Quealey.     During the 1920s the band was so in demand that they purchased a hotel on Pelham Parkway in the Bronx where they lived\, practiced\, and performed\, and dubbed it the Ramblers Inn. They went on to play some of the greatest clubs in New York City including the Rainbow Room at the top of the Rockefeller Center.     The original recordings made here were all “acoustical” 78s and interestingly\, recorded prior to the introduction of the microphone in 1925.     Although the music has been all but lost in our modern society\, it is my hope that these remastered jewels plucked from of our early American traditions will now live on into the 21st century and beyond.

Remake of a country song written by Vaughn Horton. The Sons of the Pioneers charted at #4 Country with this song in 1947. Another remake charted at #63 on the Hot 100 for Joe Barry in 1961. Further Country chart remakes: Rex Allen Jr. at #18 in 1976 and #45 for Marty Robbins in 1981. Original Billboard review: "This one could put the thrush back in the best seller class.

Well the both 12" versions low down and girl you are the one are just as long as the album versions. Alfonzo was a great singer\, with some good songs\, but to my opinion\, they should have launched him as an artist in his own right and not just a copycat of Michal Jackson. This last fact was surely true for his looks. Sadly enough he faded away from the scene\, maybe a wrong choice of managment or something like that. He was a great singer! This song is an absolutely favourite of mine! Anyone knows what happend to him? COL channel name VAL peterpiessens	1

COL title VAL I'm Eighteen COL performer VAL Alice Cooper	COL video title VAL The Newbeats -_I'm Blue - (The Gong-Gong)_1964 Hickory.wmv COL description VAL Texan Larry Henley first performed with the Dean and Marc Combo in 1962. Business links with Nashville-based Hickory Records owner Wesley Rose rapidly led to solo releases by Larry Henley and also\, Dean and Marc.  In June 1964\, Larry\, Dean and Marc got together and cut an unusual\, falsetto-driven demo of the Everly Brothers' "Bye Bye Love." The song's composer\, Bouldleaux Bryant\, heard the dazzling demo and immediately convinced Wesley Rose to sign the trio to a separate\, (third!) recording contract. Fred Foster\, owner of Monument Records\, suggested the "Newbeats" name.  Holland Picture Sleeve - Bye Bye Love was never released on 45 in the USA  "Bye Bye Love\," "Break Away (From That Boy)" (later a #34 hit in Cash Box) and the Chevrolet Corvair tune "Tough Little Buggy" were duly recorded on June 28\, 1964. At the last minute Rose's brother-in-law suggested a song called "Bread And Butter." Dean Mathis created a new\, authoritative arrangement on the spot\, showcasing Larry Henley's scorching\, gospel-influenced falsetto.  When released\, "Bread And Butter" was buried on the 'B' side of "Tough Little Buggy." But DJs at Detroit's WKNR radio flipped the single and "Bread And Butter" blasted onto the WKNR survey the week of July 16\, 1964\, soon peaking at #1.  Nationally "Bread And Butter" shot to #2 and attained Gold sales.  The Newbeats' jaw-dropping national TV debut took place Wednesday\, September 30\, 1964 on ABC-TV's 'Shindig.'  An appearance on 'American Bandstand' came next. The group then stormed Europe via Holland's 'Grand Gala du Disque 1964\,' a widely seen\, four hour television spectacular.   Billboard September 12\, 1964  In addition to "A Patent On Love" (originally intended for Joey "Midnight Mary" Powers) and "Pink Dally Rue" (later recorded by Jimmy Elledge and Robin Wilson)\, the 'Bread & Butter' album included "Thou Shalt Not Steal\," penned by longtime Hickory confederate John D. Loudermilk ("Norman\," "Talk Back Trembling Lips"). Dick and Deedee recognized the potential of the album cut and soon lodged a version of "Thou Shalt Not Steal" at #13 on the charts (Warner single 5482). Another Loudermilk tune\, the #16 "Everything's Alright\," became the Newbeats' follow-up to "Bread And Butter."  From January 22 through February 13\, 1965\, the Newbeats toured Australia and New Zealand with the Rolling Stones\, Roy Orbison and Rolf Harris. During the tour\, Larry Henley became very close to Mick Jagger and the two even planned an album project. Hickory owner Wesley Rose managed tour headliner Roy Orbison. The Newbeats later recorded Orbison's "Oh\, Pretty Woman" and "Lookin' For Love."  "(The Bees Are For The Birds) The Birds Are For The Bees\," was written by the composers of "Bread And Butter\," Larry Parks and Jay Turnbow\, with help from Bob Finnicum. While "Bread And Butter" had referred to sex in sympathetic gastronomic terms\, the refreshingly naïve "Birds Are For The Bees" found Larry Henley (27)\, Dean Mathis (28) and Marc Mathis (25) innocently claiming\, "Grown-ups tell me the birds and the bees do other things than live in trees" and concluding\, to the astonishment of angst-ridden teen listeners\, "I don't care if they can fly it's got nothing to do with you and I."  Issued with two different front covers\, the April 1965 album 'Big Beat Sounds' showcased the Newbeats' most recent single sides. The aforementioned Larry Parks\, Jay Turnbow and Bob Finnicum contributed three additional quirky tunes to the album. 'Big Beat Sounds' also contained valuable material such as Goffin and King's lead-off cut "I Can't Hear You No More" and Keith Colley and Nancie Mantz's closer "Human Kindness."  Colley and Mantz had penned tunes for Rick Nelson ("That's All She Wrote")\, Bobby Bare ("Talk Me Some Sense") and Skeeter Davis ("Ladder Of Success"). Nanci Mantz later co-wrote several songs for the Electric Prunes\, including "I Had Too Much To Dream (Last Night)."  The driving "Little Child" was released as a single in the summer of 1965. Oddly\, it did not drive the national charts wild. But the group's publicity blitz continued unabated with appearances on ABC-TV's 'Where The Action Is' on July 20 and August 25\, 1965.  The Newbeats scored a major comeback with the September 1965 single\, "Run\, Baby Run." The #12 hit boasted exquisite vocal harmonies and a stomping Motown beat. And "Run\, Baby Run" had legs; in 1971 it went Top Ten in England. Roy Orbison and the Tremelos even cut versions of the influential tune.  November 1965 saw 'Run\, Baby Run\,' the Newbeats' third and final Hickory album. Remakes of the Isley Brothers' "This Old Heart" and the Supremes' "Come See About Me" boldly demonstrated the influence of Motown soul while covers of "Help" and "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction" recognized the Beatles and Rolling Stones.

COL title VAL Someone Stole Gabriel's Horn COL performer VAL Spike Hughes and His Negro Orchestra	COL video title VAL Maddox Brothers & Rose - No Help Wanted COL description VAL The Maddox Brothers and Rose\, known as America's Most Colorful Hillbilly Band from the 1930s to the 1950s\, consisted of four brothers\, Fred\, Cal\, Cliff and Don Maddox\, along with their sister Rose. Cliff died in 1949 and was replaced by brother Henry. The group disbanded in 1956.  The family hailed from Boaz\, Alabama\, but rode the rails and hitch hiked to California in 1933 when the band members were still children\, following the failed efforts of their sharecropper parents during the early part of the Depression. They were a little in advance of the flood of Okies who were to flood the state in the 30s. They struggled to make a living as intinerant fruit and vegetable pickers following the harvest as far north as Washington state\, and as far east as Arizona\, as well as in the San Joaquin Valley. They often worked from dawn to dusk\, sleeping and eating on the ground.  Having settled in Modesto\, the family developed their musical ability and\, in 1937 performed on the radio\, sponsored by a local furniture store. In 1939 they entered a hillbilly band competition at the centenial Sacramento State Fair after driving to Sacramento in their Model A. When they took the stage they tore through "Sally Let Your Bangs Hang Down" with rocking rhythms and risque lyrics. They became\, officially\, California's best hillbilly band.  The brothers and Rose appeared at places such as the 97th Street Corral in Los Angles.  From 1946-1951 the group recorded for 4 Star Records (Hollywood)\, then for Columbia Records. Some 4 Star masters were leased and released by US.-Decca Records at the beginning of the 1950s. The following quotes are from Rose Maddox. "We were called hillbilly singers - not country - then. No\, none of this country music then. People just called us hillbilly... People tell me that I was one of the first women to sing what I sang - country boogie. I guess I was. There was no rock 'n' roll in those early days\, before 1955. Only country boogie. My brothers also played that way. We called it country then.  The Maddox's material ranged from the country standards of Hank Williams and Merle Travis\, cowboy songs\, to the Western swing of Bob Wills\, to old-time\, folk\, and church singing\, to jazz\, swing\, boogie woogie and even a taste of early rock and roll.  Fred Maddox played upright bass using the "slap bass" technique as early as 1937.[5] This trademark backbeat\, a slapping bass style\, helped drive a broad change in popular music\, sporting a faster\, immediately discernible rhythm that came to be known as rockabilly.  Fred Maddox's bass is displayed at the Experience Music Project in Seattle. "They wanted his bass because they believe he might have hit the first note of rock 'n' roll on it.

COL title VAL Dancing with Tears in My Eyes COL performer VAL Ben Selvin and His Orchestra	COL video title VAL Dancing with Tears in my Eyes-Regents Club Orchestra-Bob Haring 1930 COL description VAL Bob Haring (1896-????) Was the singer for several different bands in the 1920s\, including the Colonial Club Orchestra and The Regents Club Orchestra. He disappeared from public view in 1934 when he was laid off from work in the record industry as an executive and then genuinely disappeared for good\, because no one knows what happened to him after that. This was one of his biggest hits\, charting at #25 in 1930 for the year. Also a big(ger) hit for Nat Skrillet in the same year.  Photo is of the Regents Club Dance Hall In Brighton\, England. It was converted to a bingo hall in 1967 and then bulldozed in 1974\, a victim of changing taste in dance music.  50 hits on 9/26/11 100 hits on 11/10/11 250 hits on 3/16/12 500 htis on 9/6/12 COL channel name VAL MusicProjectX	1

He's underneath the window\, she's singing\, "Hey la\, my boyfriend's back. You shouldn't come around here singing up to people like that... Anyway\, what you gonna do about it?"  ROMEO: Juliet\, the dice was loaded from the start And I bet when you exploded into my heart And I forget I forget the movie song. When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong\, Juliet?  Come up on different streets\, they're both the streets of shame. Both dirty\, both mean\, yes\, in the dream it was just the same And I dreamed your dream for you and now your dream is real. How can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals?  When you can fall for chains of silver\,  You can fall for chains of gold\, You can fall for pretty strangers  And the promises they hold. You promised me everything\, you promised me thick and thin\, yeah! Now you just say\, "Oh Romeo? Yeah\, you know I used to have a scene with him".  Juliet\, when we made love\, you used to cry. You said\, "I love you like the stars above\, I'll love you 'til I die". There's a place for us\, you know the movie song. When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong\, Juliet?

I can't do anything\, 'cept be in love with you! And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be. All I do is keep the beat... and bad company. Now all I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme\, Juliet\, I'd do the stars with you any time!  Juliet\, when we made love you used to cry.

As a successful pop music performer\, Diamond scored a number of hits worldwide in the 1960s\, 1970s\, and 1980s. According to David Wild\, common themes in Diamond's songs are "a deep sense of isolation and an equal desire for connection. A yearning for home -- and at the same time\, the allure of greater freedom. The good\, the bad and the ugly about a crazy little thing called love."  As of 2001 Diamond has 115 million records sold worldwide\, including 48 million records in the U.S. In terms of Billboard chart success\, he is the third most successful Adult Contemporary artist ever\, ranking behind only Barbra Streisand and Elton John.  Though his record sales declined somewhat after the 1980s\, Diamond continues to tour successfully\, and maintains a very loyal following. Diamond's songs have been recorded by a vast array of performers from many different musical genres.  Diamond was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1984\, and in 2000 received the Sammy Cahn Lifetime Achievement Award.  In 1966 Diamond signed a deal with Bert Berns's Bang Records label\, which was then a subsidiary company of Atlantic Records. His first release on that label\, "Solitary Man"\, was his first hit. Prior to the release of "Solitary Man\," Neil had considered using a stage name; he came up with two possible stage names\, "Noah Kaminsky"[citation needed] and "Eice Chary"[citation needed]. But when asked by Bang Records which name he was going to use\, Noah\, Eice\, or Neil\, he thought of his grandmother\, who died prior to the release of Solitary Man. Thus he told Bang Records\, "...go with Neil Diamond and I'll figure it out later." Diamond followed it with "Cherry\, Cherry"\, "Kentucky Woman"\, "Thank the Lord for the Night Time"\, "Do It\," and others. Diamond's Bang recordings were produced by legendary Brill Building songwriters Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich\, both of whom can be heard singing background on many of the tracks...

Que j'me démène ou qu'je reste coi Je passe pour un je-ne-sais-quoi  Je ne fais pourtant de tort à  personne En suivant mon chemin de petit bonhomme. Mais les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Non les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Tout le monde médit de moi\, Sauf les muets\, ça va de soi.  Le jour du Quatorze Juillet Je reste dans mon lit douillet. La musique qui marche au pas\, Cela ne me regarde pas.  Je ne fais pourtant de tort à  personne\, En n'écoutant pas le clairon qui sonne. Mais les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Non les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Tout le monde me montre du doigt Sauf les manchots\, ça va de soi.  Quand j'croise un voleur malchanceux\, Poursuivi par un cul-terreux; J'lance la patte et pourquoi le taire\, Le cul-terreux s'retrouve par terre  Je ne fais pourtant de tort à  personne\, En laissant courir les voleurs de pommes. Mais les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Non les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Tout le monde se rue sur moi\, Sauf les culs-de-jatte\, ça va de soi.  Pas besoin d'être Jérémie\, Pour d'viner l'sort qui m'est promis\, S'ils trouvent une corde à  leur goût\, Ils me la passeront au cou\,  Je ne fais pourtant de tort à  personne\, En suivant les ch'mins qui n'mènent pas à  Rome\, Mais les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Non les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Tout l'mond' viendra me voir pendu\, Sauf les aveugles\, bien entendu.

COL title VAL I'm Eighteen COL performer VAL Sex Museum	COL video title VAL NYSF Threepenny Opera - 19 - Call From the Grave COL description VAL This is an LP transfer of the 1976 New York Shakespeare Festival's revival production of "The Threepenny Opera."  This recording should not be confused with the original 1954 New York production recording\, nor the 1994 Donmar Warehouse production recording in England.  Unlike Marc Blitzstein's version which ran during the 1950's for six years and featured the incomparable Lotte Lenya\, this translation is less sanitized and more in keeping with the seedy and sexual nature of the original german play.    From the liner notes to the album - "the successful Blitzstein version was an adaptation rather than a translation\, and in comparing it to the original\, we were surprised at the extent to which his treatment vitiated the political and sexual thrust which gives the work its relentless power.  Blitzstein sweetened and cleaned up Brecht's unsparing lyrics\, partially in deference to stage censorship...but in doing so he in many instances changed Brecht's meanings around entirely\, and throughout he softened the impact of Brecht's biting ferocity.  He also attempted to make the lyrics more 'singable' by fitting them into conventional musical patterns\, and in this he succeeded admirably."  The translation used for this revival was prepared by Ralph Maheim and John Willett; the full text can be found in their edition of Brecht's Collected Plays\, Volume 2.  A hardcover edition was also published in conjunction with the revival.  This revival was directed by conceptual theater artist Richard Foreman\, and starred Raul Julia and Ellen Greene\, both of whom were nominated for Tony Awards.  It was produced by Joseph Papp and the New York Shakespeare Festival at the Vivian Beaumont Theatre at Lincoln Center.  Additional information regarding the production\, including cast list\, can be found at the Internet Broadway Database's listing for this revival at http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=3835 ...  As of June 2007\, this cast album has not been released or reissued on CD; it was originally made available in 1976 on LP\, and this is an LP transfer.  As such\, the quality is not CD quality  - there will occasionally be noise\, popping\, or hissing.

COL title VAL Old and Wise COL performer VAL The Alan Parsons Project	COL video title VAL Maddox Brothers & Rose - No Help Wanted COL description VAL The Maddox Brothers and Rose\, known as America's Most Colorful Hillbilly Band from the 1930s to the 1950s\, consisted of four brothers\, Fred\, Cal\, Cliff and Don Maddox\, along with their sister Rose. Cliff died in 1949 and was replaced by brother Henry. The group disbanded in 1956.  The family hailed from Boaz\, Alabama\, but rode the rails and hitch hiked to California in 1933 when the band members were still children\, following the failed efforts of their sharecropper parents during the early part of the Depression. They were a little in advance of the flood of Okies who were to flood the state in the 30s. They struggled to make a living as intinerant fruit and vegetable pickers following the harvest as far north as Washington state\, and as far east as Arizona\, as well as in the San Joaquin Valley. They often worked from dawn to dusk\, sleeping and eating on the ground.  Having settled in Modesto\, the family developed their musical ability and\, in 1937 performed on the radio\, sponsored by a local furniture store. In 1939 they entered a hillbilly band competition at the centenial Sacramento State Fair after driving to Sacramento in their Model A. When they took the stage they tore through "Sally Let Your Bangs Hang Down" with rocking rhythms and risque lyrics. They became\, officially\, California's best hillbilly band.  The brothers and Rose appeared at places such as the 97th Street Corral in Los Angles.  From 1946-1951 the group recorded for 4 Star Records (Hollywood)\, then for Columbia Records. Some 4 Star masters were leased and released by US.-Decca Records at the beginning of the 1950s. The following quotes are from Rose Maddox. "We were called hillbilly singers - not country - then. No\, none of this country music then. People just called us hillbilly... People tell me that I was one of the first women to sing what I sang - country boogie. I guess I was. There was no rock 'n' roll in those early days\, before 1955. Only country boogie. My brothers also played that way. We called it country then.  The Maddox's material ranged from the country standards of Hank Williams and Merle Travis\, cowboy songs\, to the Western swing of Bob Wills\, to old-time\, folk\, and church singing\, to jazz\, swing\, boogie woogie and even a taste of early rock and roll.  Fred Maddox played upright bass using the "slap bass" technique as early as 1937.[5] This trademark backbeat\, a slapping bass style\, helped drive a broad change in popular music\, sporting a faster\, immediately discernible rhythm that came to be known as rockabilly.  Fred Maddox's bass is displayed at the Experience Music Project in Seattle. "They wanted his bass because they believe he might have hit the first note of rock 'n' roll on it.

COL title VAL Boogie Stop Shuffle COL performer VAL New York Ska-Jazz Ensemble	COL video title VAL "How Ya Gonna Keep 'Em Down on the Farm?" (Nora Bayes\, 1919) COL description VAL America was as quick in getting out of Europe following World War One as she was tardy in entering that conflict. As a nation\, we were forever transformed...America's involvement in World War One brought a change of character with it\, and that change was felt nowhere more keenly than Rural America. Looking back\, the family farm has been in decline ever since. Walter Donaldson wrote the music to this in 1919 (Joe Young and Sam M. Lewis wrote the words)\, and the song wound up being an overnight smash hit. It was recorded by nearly everyone\, but no rendition was more sublimely spirited than this one\, recorded for Columbia by Nora Bayes - a vaudeville talent of legendary proportions.   HOW YA GONNA KEEP 'EM DOWN ON THE FARM?  Reuben\, Reuben\, I've been thinking Said his wifey dear Now that all is peaceful and calm The boys will soon be back on the farm Mister Reuben started winking and slowly rubbed his chin He pulled his chair up close to mother And he asked her with a grin  How ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm After they've seen Paree' How ya gonna keep 'em away from Broadway Jazzin around and paintin' the town How ya gonna keep 'em away from harm\, that's a mystery They'll never want to see a rake or plow And who the deuce can parleyvous a cow? How ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm After they've seen Paree'?  How ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm After they've seen Paree' How ya gonna keep 'em away from Broadway Jazzin around and paintin' the town How ya gonna keep 'em away from harm\, that's a mystery Imagine Reuben when he meets his Pa He'll kiss his cheek and holler "OO-LA-LA!

Damita Jo\, was an American actress\, comedian\, and lounge music performer. DeBlanc was born in Austin\, Texas\,[2] the featured vocalist on recordings from Steve Gibson and the Red Caps during the 1950s.[3] She later went on to marry Gibson\, but they parted ways professionally and personally in 1959.  Credited as simply Damita Jo\, DeBlanc had some chart success in the early 1960s with two answer songs: 1960's "I'll Save the Last Dance for You" (an answer to "Save the Last Dance for Me") and 1961's "I'll Be There" (an answer to "Stand By Me"). Both songs were originally sung by Ben E. King and made the R&B top 20\, and "I'll Be There" also reached number 12 on the pop chart. In 1962 she recorded "Dance With a Dolly (With a Hole in her Stocking)"\, previously made famous by The Andrews Sisters and Bill Haley\, for Mercury Records. In 1966 she had a minor hit with a cover of the Jacques Brel song "If You Go Away."  She worked with Ray Charles\, Count Basie\, and Lionel Hampton. And\, in 1963\, she released a recording for Mercury Records with Billy Eckstine and Bobby Tucker Orchestra.  Damita Jo was later involved in comedy and toured with Redd Foxx. In 1998\, she suffered a respiratory illness and died on Christmas Day[2] in Baltimore\, Maryland. COL channel name VAL AMNON SUODAI	0

COL title VAL Liebeslied COL performer VAL Sven Ratzke & Claron McFadden	COL video title VAL NYSF Threepenny Opera - 07 - Liebeslied (Look at the Moon over Soho) COL description VAL This is an LP transfer of the 1976 New York Shakespeare Festival's revival production of "The Threepenny Opera."  This recording should not be confused with the original 1954 New York production recording\, nor the 1994 Donmar Warehouse production recording in England.  Unlike Marc Blitzstein's version which ran during the 1950's for six years and featured the incomparable Lotte Lenya\, this translation is less sanitized and more in keeping with the seedy and sexual nature of the original german play.    From the liner notes to the album - "the successful Blitzstein version was an adaptation rather than a translation\, and in comparing it to the original\, we were surprised at the extent to which his treatment vitiated the political and sexual thrust which gives the work its relentless power.  Blitzstein sweetened and cleaned up Brecht's unsparing lyrics\, partially in deference to stage censorship...but in doing so he in many instances changed Brecht's meanings around entirely\, and throughout he softened the impact of Brecht's biting ferocity.  He also attempted to make the lyrics more 'singable' by fitting them into conventional musical patterns\, and in this he succeeded admirably."  The translation used for this revival was prepared by Ralph Maheim and John Willett; the full text can be found in their edition of Brecht's Collected Plays\, Volume 2.  A hardcover edition was also published in conjunction with the revival.  This revival was directed by conceptual theater artist Richard Foreman\, and starred Raul Julia and Ellen Greene\, both of whom were nominated for Tony Awards.  It was produced by Joseph Papp and the New York Shakespeare Festival at the Vivian Beaumont Theatre at Lincoln Center.  Additional information regarding the production\, including cast list\, can be found at the Internet Broadway Database's listing for this revival at http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=3835 ...  As of June 2007\, this cast album has not been released or reissued on CD; it was originally made available in 1976 on LP\, and this is an LP transfer.  As such\, the quality is not CD quality  - there will occasionally be noise\, popping\, or hissing.

COL title VAL As Long as You're Living COL performer VAL Dee Alexander	COL video title VAL BERT HEERINK STORM NA DE STILTE Rocksterren COL description VAL I DO NOT OWN THIS VIDEO. © (c)Copyright belongs to the rightful owner  Bert Heerink (Utrecht\, 26 januari 1953) is een Nederlandse muzikant. Heerink werd voornamelijk bekend als zanger van de Nederlandse hardrockband Vandenberg\, die ook internationaal succes had.Met Vandenberg had Heerink in de jaren 80 twee wereldhits: Burning Heart en Different Worlds. Nadat Vandenberg de samenwerking met Heerink beëindigde trad Bert toe tot de heavy metal band Picture en nam een aantal Nederlandstalige albums op. Bekend werd hij verder door in 1995 voor een aantal reclames voor Heineken Nederlandstalige teksten te zingen op melodieën van oude rocknummers. De nummers Zon in de Winter\, Doe wat je wil en Julie July werden hits. Voor het album Storm na de Stilte kreeg hij een gouden plaat.Bij de reünie van Kayak  in 2000 werd Heerink zanger van deze band en bleef dit tot 2006. In 2002 toert Bert met het orkest van de Koninklijke Luchtmacht door Nederland in de hoofdrol van "Tommy".Met Peter Groot Kormelink en Erik Mesie vormt Heerink het muzikale feestprogramma "De Heeren van Oranje" waarin alle grote hits van de 3 Heeren voorbij komen.Bert neemt in 2005/2006 ook vocalen voor zijn rekening tijdens de succesvolle tour van het orkest van Koninklijke Luchtmacht door de Nederlandse theaters: Queen in concert\, waarbij diverse Queen klassiekers worden vertolkt. Sommige nummers worden ook in een nieuw jasje gestoken\, zoals 'Crazy little thing called love'\, welke een big band sausje krijgt.In 2006 heeft Bert Heerink samen met zijn zus Saskia onder de naam Heerink een album uitgebracht met de naam Purify. Het album wordt gekenmerkt door een persoonlijke inslag.In 2007 en ook in 2008 maakte Heerink met het Noord Nederlands Orkest (NNO) onder leiding van de Belgische dirigent Dirk Brossé met het cross-overprogramma Symphonic echoes of Pink Floyd een tournee\, waarin de grote hits van de Engelse rockformatie centraal staan. Naast Heerink nemen Antonie Kamerling en Erik Mesie de zangpartijen voor hun rekening\, bijgestaan door onder meer gitarist Joost Vergoossen.Het wordt het tot dan toe best bezochte concertjaar met ruim 98.000 bezoekers. In 2008 vervangt Chris Zeegers Antonie Kamerling bij deze productie.Tegenwoordig (2006) woont Heerink in Hoogeveen. Recentelijk bracht Heerink de single "When I close my eyes"\, uit. De single is uitsluitend via de website www.bertheerink.nl te downloaden en de opbrengst gaat naar de stichting KidsRights die zich wereldwijd inzet voor de rechten van kinderen. Op 6 december 2008 ontving Bert Heerink het Lidmaatschap in de Orde van Oranje Nassau als waardering voor zijn inzet en prestaties in de popmuziek en zijn inzet voor de kinderrechtenorganisatie KidsRights. Eerder ontving Bert Heerink in Hoogeveen om dezelfde reden een eigen ster in de "Walk of Veen".In april 2009 brengt Heerink samen met collega's Erik Mesie en Peter Groot Kormelink onder de naam "Heeren van Oranje" hun eerste eigen single uit; "Made in Holland" waarmee ze landelijk debuteerden op het Tros Muziekfeest in Middelburg. In samenwerking met OAR Heaven Records werkt Bert vanaf mei 2009 in Duitsland in de studio van Michael Voss aan een volledig eigen Engelstalig rockalbum. De uitnodiging een dergelijk album te maken kwam na het meewerken aan het tweede "Voices of Rock" album waar Bert met "Shame on you" op vertegenwoordigd is. Het album komt op 25 september wereldwijd uit en bevat nummers van grote songwriters als Jeff Silbard (Wind beneath my Wings) en Russ Ballard.In februari 2010 komt de eerste single van dit album "Panic Attack" binnen in de single top 100 waarna deze doorstijgt en hoog in de charts komt. Een tweede stuk "All fired Up" wordt tegelijkertijd door het TT Circuit Assen gekozen tot de seizoenstune. Op 3 april trad Heerink tijdens de 5e uitreiking van de Eddie Christiani Award\, die hijzelf opnieuw presenteerde\,op met Steve Lukather\, (gitarist/zanger van Toto) de winnaar van deze editie.

Cale\, Snuff Garrett  This was a Snuff Garrett project as a compilation album of covers of numbers that were popular on Hollywood's Sunset Strip. These were combined with newly-written numbers by J.J. Cale who was a member of the makeshift group assembled for the recording\, who called themselves "The Leathercoated Minds".  ------------------------  "Along Comes Mary" is a song composed by Tandyn Almer\, originally recorded in 1966 by American sunshine pop band the Association. It was the group's first hit\, released on their debut album\, And Then... Along Comes the Association (1966).  Background  "Along Comes Mary" is sung from the point of view of a once-disillusioned young man talking about the "tribulations no one ever sees" and who "curse[s] those faults in me." The singer believes Mary gives him comfort and improves his life. An acquaintance of Almer claimed in an interview that "Mary" refers to marijuana\, though it is unclear if Almer ever confirmed this. In the Young People's Concert titled What Is a Mode? Leonard Bernstein explained that the song was composed in the Dorian mode.  Bloodhound Gang version  American rock band Bloodhound Gang recorded a version of "Along Comes Mary" with new punk music to accompany the lyrics. It first appeared on the 1998 soundtrack to the film Half Baked before appearing on Bloodhound Gang's third studio album\, Hooray for Boobies\, the following year. "Along Comes Mary" was released as the album's first single in May 1999 and reached No. 5 in Austria\, No. 6 in Germany\, and No. 13 in Switzerland. The song was certified gold in both Austria and Germany.  Other covers  In 1966\, Hugh Masekela included the song on his album Hugh Masekela's Next Album\, and in 1967\, Cal Tjader covered it for his album Along Comes Cal. That same year\, Baja Marimba Band's had a minor hit with their cover of the song.  In 1968\, George Benson included a version on his album Giblet Gravy\, and in 1986 a cover appeared on R. Stevie Moore's album Glad Music.  In 1995\, the Manhattan Transfer covered the song for their album Tonin'\, and the following year\, 24-7 Spyz covered it for their album 6.  In 2005\, a cover of the song appeared on the Guess Who's compilation album Let's Go\, and Plainsong also released a cover on their self-titled album.  ------------------------  Lyrics  Every time I think that I'm the only one who's lonely someone calls on me. And every now and then I spend my time in rhyme and verse and curse those faults in me.  And then along comes Mary And does she want to give me kicks\, and be my steady chick and give me pick of memories Or maybe rather gather tales of all the fails and tribulations no one ever sees.  When we met I was sure out to lunch Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch.  When vague desire is the fire in the eyes of chicks whose sickness is the games they play. And when the masquerade is played and neighbor folks make jokes as who is most to blame today.  And then along comes Mary And does she want to set them free\, and let them see reality from where she got her name. And will they struggle much when told that such a tender touch as hers will make them not the same.  When we met I was sure out to lunch Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch\, sweet as the punch\, sweet as the punch\, sweet as the punch\, sweet as the punch.

Most pieces exploited the players' individual virtuosity\, but in principle the writing for the group emphasized collectivity rather than individuality\, always knitted tightly by Pasborg's strong drumming.... Odessa 5 is certainly a band to be blown away by''  - All About Jazz\, USA.   Stefan Pasborg's band Odessa ''X-tra Large'' features some of the finest musicians on the Nordic jazz scenes. Musicians that aren't afraid to cross new musical land. Together they play some seriously exiting multi-jazz. The bodily and the imagination is the main focus\, and you have to travel all the way back in time to Charles Mingus to find the same kind of energy. There is not so much more to say other than when the musicians are having fun\, as they so obviously have in this case\, then the listener has as well. COL channel name VAL copentube	0

COL title VAL Queen of Hearts COL performer VAL Valentina	COL video title VAL MELINDA SCHNEIDER & BECCY COLE Queen of Hearts COL description VAL A Mother's Day tribute utilising the fabulous Australian country singers Melinda Schneider and Beccy Cole who are two of the nation's pre-eminent singers who came together to record an album of classic female country songs with the apt title 'Great Women of Country and the Songs that Made them'.  With very different vocal tones and style\, Beccy and Melinda do great justice to a generous amount of iconic tracks on their duet album. I chose this recording\, as the best known (although not the original) version by Juice Newton is pretty hard to top. but these two ladies give it a red hot go! I love the unique qualities they bring to this set\, and they seem to be having a great old time doing it\, as well. They filmed a very cute vid for their version of '9 to 5' - check it out - it gives people a sense of the performers and their great approach. Melinda is the daughter of yodelling superstar Mary Schneider\, and Beccy's mum Carole Sturtzel was regarded as the Queen of Country Music in South Australia. For me it is a lovely opportunity here to be able to post a clip of these two wonderful daughters and celebrate the terrific careers they have both carved out for themselves. Both have multiple Golden Guitar awards (Australia's Country Music Prizes) and have scored many hits from their already prolific catalogues.   Happy Mother's Day to all the wonderful Mums out there.

Some day you'll return to  Your valleys and your farms  And you'll no longer burn  To be brothers in arms.    Through these fields of destruction  Baptism of fire  I've witnessed your suffering  As the battle raged higher.  And though they did hurt me so bad  In my fear and alarm  You did not desert me  My brothers in arms.    There's so many different worlds  So many different suns  And we have just one world  But we live in different ones.    Now the sun's gone to hell  And the moon's riding high  Let me bid you farewell  Every man has to die.  But it's written in the starlight  And every line in your palm  We're fools to make war  On our brothers in arms... COL channel name VAL UFCHeadhunter	0

Real Around the Fountain Q-Burn's Abstract Message  ------------------------  "Panic" is a song by the British alternative rock band The Smiths\, written by singer Morrissey and guitarist Johnny Marr. The first recording to feature new member Craig Gannon\, "Panic" bemoans the state of contemporary pop music\, and implores its listeners to "burn down the disco" and "hang the DJ" in retaliation. "Panic" was released by Rough Trade Records as a non-album single in 1986\, reaching number 11 in the UK Singles Chart.  Background and recording  The Smiths recorded "Panic" at London's Livingston Studios in May 1986. It was the group's first recording sessions since they completed work on their third album The Queen Is Dead six months earlier. During the interim period\, bassist Andy Rourke had been sacked due to his drug addiction. The band recruited Craig Gannon to replace him\, but after they re-employed Rourke\, guitarist Johnny Marr offered Gannon a position as second guitarist.  Composition and lyrics  A story circulated as the basis for the song is that days before recording the song\, Marr and Morrissey were listening to BBC Radio One when a news report announced the Chernobyl disaster. Straight after the report\, disc jockey Steve Wright played the song "I'm Your Man" by pop duo Wham!. "I remember actually saying\, 'What the fuck has this got to do with people's lives?'" Marr recalled. "We hear about Chernobyl\, then\, seconds later\, we're expected to jump around to 'I'm Your Man'". While Marr subsequently stated that the account was exaggerated\, he commented that it was a likely influence on Morrissey's lyrics.[4] The band even commissioned a t-shirt featuring Wright's portrait and the phrase "Hang the DJ!"  Journalist Nick Kent described "Panic" as a mandate for "rock terrorism". Musically\, the song is based around a rotation between the G and E minor chords that mimicks "Metal Guru" by the glam rock band T.Rex. The song begins with Morrissey mentioning chaos unravelling throughout Britain and Ireland (specifically naming locales such as Dublin\, Dundee\, Carlisle and Humberside). In the second part of the song\, Morrissey reveals that the source of this chaos is pop music\, which in his words "Says nothing to me about my life". In reaction\, Morrissey implores listeners to "Burn down the disco" and "hang the DJ"\, the latter lyrics repeated with the addition of a chorus of schoolchildren. Morrissey considered the fact that the song appeared on daytime British radio a "tiny revolution" in its own way\, as it aired amongst the very music it criticised.  Release and reception  "Panic" drew fire from critics who construed Morrissey's lyrics to have a racist connotation\, due to their disparagement of the "disco" and the "DJ". The criticism was intensified by comments Morrissey made in a September 1986 Melody Maker interview with Frank Owen\, where the singer denounced a "black pop conspiracy". Marr in particular was incensed by the article and threatened to "kick the living shit" out of the writer if he crossed the band's path. Marr countered that "disco music" could not be equated with "black music"; he argued\, "To those who took offence at the 'burn down the disco' line [. . .] I'd say please show me the black members of New Order!"  "Panic" reached number eleven on the UK Singles Chart and stayed on the chart for eight weeks. The single also stayed on the Irish Singles Chart for five weeks\, reaching a peak of number seven\, and reached number thirty-two on the Dutch Top 40. "Panic" was voted Single of the Year by the annual NME readers poll\, and also ("somewhat incongruously"\, noted Smiths biographer Simon Goddard) ranked sixth in the Best Dance Record category. In 2007\, NME placed "Panic" at number 21 in its list of the 50 Greatest Indie Anthems Ever. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

Scammell The Squid Jiggin' Ground Part 1 (with lyrics) COL description VAL Oh\, this is the place where the fishermen gather\,  With oilskins and boots and Cape Anns battened down;  All sizes of figures with squid lines and jiggers\,  They congregate here on the squid-jigging ground.   Some are workin' their jiggers while others are yarnin'\,  There's some standin' up and there's more lyin' down;  While all kinds of fun\, jokes and tricks are begun  As they wait for the squid on the squid-jiggin' ground.   There's men of all ages and boys in the bargain;  There's old Billy Cave and there's young Raymond Brown\,  There's a red rantin' Tory out here in a dory\,  A-runnin' down Squires on the squid-jiggin' ground.   There's men from the Harbour and men from the Tickle\,  In all kinds of motorboats\, green\, grey and brown;  Right yonder is Bobby and with him is Nobby\,  He's chawin' hard tack on the squid-jiggin' ground.   God bless my sou'wester\, there's Skipper John Chaffey\,  He's the best hand at squid-jiggin' here\, I'll be bound.  Hello! What's the row? Why he's jiggin' one now\,  The very first squid on the squid-jiggin' ground.   The man with the whiskers is old Jacob Steele;  He's gettin well up but he's still pretty sound.  While Uncle Bob Hawkins wears six pair o' stockin's  Whenever he's out on the squid-jiggin' ground.   Holy smoke! What a scuffle! All hands are excited.  'Tis a wonder to me that there's nobody drowned.  There's confusion\, a bustle\, a wonderful hustle\,  They're all jiggin' squids on the squid-jiggin' ground.   Says Bobby\, "The squids are on top of the water\,  I just got me jigger 'bout one fathom down" ---  When a squid in the boat squirted right down his throat\,  And he's swearin' like mad on the squid-jiggin' ground.   There's poor Uncle Billy\, his whiskers are spattered  With spots of the squid juice that's flying around;  One poor little b'y got it right in the eye\,  But they don't give a damn on the squid-jiggin' ground.   Now if ever you feel inclined to go squiddin'\,  Leave your white shirts and collars behind in the town.  And if you get cranky without your silk hanky  You'd better steer clear of the squid-jiggin' ground.   Found in a used record store dollar bin in Sydney\, Cape Breton\, NS\, 2002.

COL title VAL Jesus Loves the Little Children COL performer VAL Roy Rogers and Dale Evans	COL video title VAL Tramp\, Tramp\, Tramp\, the Boys Are Marching COL description VAL A song by George Root\, detailing the life of a Union prisoner in the Civil War.  In the prison cell I sit\, Thinking Mother dear of you\, And our bright and happy home so far away\, And the tears they fill my eyes Spite of all that I can do Though I try to cheer my comrades and be gay.  Chorus: Tramp! tramp! tramp! The boys are marching Cheer up comrades\, They will come. And beneath the starry flag We shall breathe the air again Of the free land in our own beloved home.  In the battle front we stood When their fiercest charge they made\, And they swept us off a hundred men or more; But before we reached their lines They were beaten back\, dismayed\, And we heard the cry of vict'ry o'er and o'er.  So within the prison cell We are waiting for the day That shall come to open wide the iron door; And the hollow eye grows bright And the poor heart almost gay As we think of seing home and friends once more.

COL description VAL This song emanates from the UK and was written by orchestra leader Billy Reid who also wrote 'The Gypsy.' The song became a number 1 in the States for Margaret Whiting in 1948 staying on the chart for 23 weeks. This version by Marty comes from his 1977 album 'Don't Let Me Touch You.' Other singers to have recorded the song include Al Jolson\, Frank Sinatra and Connie Francis. Regarding Reid's songs 'The Gypsy' and 'A Tree In The Meadow'\, it's a pity that songs like this don't seem to get written nowadays. It seems that melody\, lyric and romance have all gone out the window in this day and age. Pity. COL channel name VAL tarquin45	0

COL title VAL The Unforgiven COL performer VAL The Boys of County Nashville	COL video title VAL Nguyên Lê - Purple - Celebrating Jimi Hendrix COL description VAL Guitarist Nguyên Lê pays tribute to Jimi Hendrix by performing ten of the late rock innovator's songs on this 2002 CD. Lê plays in the tradition of Hendrix without directly copying him\, being creative and stretching himself. The occasional vocals by drummer Terri Lyne Carrington\, Aïda Khann\, and Corin Curschellas (which are sometimes spoken as much as sung) are unfortunately not as interesting and are mostly distracting. Bassist Michel Alibo is excellent during his solos and Lê shows originality in his improvisations\, but the music overall is more heartfelt than essential\, particularly since Hendrix's own records are easily available.  Recorded at Studio Davout\, Studio Louxor\, Paris\, France and Systems Two\, New York\, New York between May & June 2002.  Personnel: Nguyên Lê (guitar\, guitar synthesizer); Terri Lyne Carrington (vocals\, drums); Michel Alibo (electric bass).  Personnel: Nguyen Le (synhtesizer\, guitar); Terri Lyne Carrington (vocals\, drums); Aida Khann\, Corin Curschellas (vocals); Bojan Zulfikarpasic (piano\, Fender Rhodes pinao); Meshell Ndegeocello\, Michel Alibo (electric bass); Karim Ziad (percussion).

I'm still not sure what to make of same sex marriage. I am a stout conservative however I believe that people should be free to share their lives with whom they wish or fall in love with regardless of sexual barriers and live it as they see fit as long as harm is not brought to others\, judgments I leave to God\, that is regarding that my rights are not encroached upon by the rights of others.  This being said I do believe that if not marriage as defined between a men and a woman there should be similar laws that protect and gives the proper rights to any two persons who form a serious home and a relationship together.  I do have friends who are in such relationships\, I do not condone discrimination based on sexual preferences and to them I dedicate this record by the great Charles Aznavour\,  it tells a touching and very lonely story.

Come a little bit closer\, you're my kind of man So big and so strong Come a little bit closer\, I'm all alone And the night is so long. Hmmmm. So we started to dance\, in my arms she felt so inviting Mmmmmm\, I just couldn't resist\, a-just a-one little kiss so exciting Then I heard the guitar player say\, va-moose\, Jose's on his way And I knew\, yes I knew\, I should run\, but then I heard her say. Come a little bit closer\, you're my kind of man So big and so strong Come a little bit closer\, I'm all alone And the night is so long. Ha\, ha\, ha\, alright. Laaa-laaa\, la-la\, laaa-laaa\, la-la Laaa-laaa\, la-la\, laaa-laaa\, la-la Then the music stopped\, when I looked\, the cafe was empty Then I heard Jose say\, man\, you know you're in trouble plenty So I dropped my drink from my hand\, and out through the window I ran And as I rode away\, I could hear her say to Jose. Come a little bit closer\, you're my kind of man So big and so strong Come a little bit closer\, I'm all alone And the night is so long. Come a little bit closer\, you're my kind of man So big and so strong Come a little bit closer\, I'm all alone And the night is so long.

Purchase from the label: http://www.paradiseofbachelors.com/shop/pob-21 Purchase from Bandcamp: https://paradiseofbachelors.bandcamp.com/album/ambsace Other options: http://lnk.to/PoB21  The second album of astonishing duets by guitarists James Elkington (who has toured and/or recorded with Jeff Tweedy\, Richard Thompson\, and Steve Gunn\, among others) and Nathan Salsburg (an accomplished soloist deemed by NPR “one of those names we’ll all associate with American folk guitar”) is a sublime suite of nimble\, filigreed compositions by two singular stylists. Belying its title—“ambsace” is the lowest throw of dice; snake eyes—the record thrives on a gentle empathy and generosity of spirit\, sitting sneakily protean original compositions alongside gorgeous arrangements of songs by Duke Ellington and The Smiths at the same big hand-hewn table.

The record was released in June 1979 on Optional Music with "The Man with the Dogs" as the b-side. The title track was re-recorded for the band's first album\, Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables (1980)\, and the version that appeared on this single\, as well as the single's b-side\, are available on the rarities album Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death (1987).  The lyrics were written by Jello Biafra and John Greenway\, and Biafra composed the music in one of his rare attempts at composing on bass.  This song was featured in the video game Tony Hawk's American Wasteland and as a downloadable song in the Rock Band series. It is also sampled in a song by the dance-punk/big beat trio The Prodigy\, "Dead Ken Beats". The song was also featured in the 2010 film The Social Network.  Meaning  The title is an allusion to the first (and no longer sung) stanza of the national anthem of Germany\, which begins with the words "Deutschland\, Deutschland über alles." (literally\, "Germany\, Germany above all.")  The song focuses on Jerry Brown\, the Governor of California 1975-1983 and 2011--present\, and is sung from his perspective. An imaginary Brown outlines a hippie-fascist vision for America\, in which his "suede denim secret police" kill un-cool people with "organic poison gas" chambers. Lines such as "Serpent's egg already hatched" (a reference to a line from William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar) comment on the corrosive nature of power. The line "now it is 1984" refers to the totalitarian regime of George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four\, describing a future (from 1979) where Jerry Brown has become President Brown presiding over secret police and gas chambers.  Cover versions  Blue Ribbon Glee Club regularly perform their version of the song.  The song was updated by The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy when they released a cover version in 1992 on the album Hypocrisy is the Greatest Legacy. They replaced references to Jerry Brown with references to Pete Wilson.  The song was also widely known in Poland (as "Kalifornia Ponad Wszystko") thanks to the cover by Polish rocker Kazik Staszewski with his band Kazik Na Żywo.  Hasidic New Wave perform a remake of the song on their 1999 album\, Kabalogy. In their version\, titled "Giuliani Über Alles"\, Jerry Brown is replaced by former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani.  The Delgados cover the song in their Peel Sessions CD set.  Six Feet Under do a cover the song on their Graveyard Classics album.  The black metal band Mayhem also covered the song.  Deceased covered the song on their punk covers album Rotten to the Core.  The hardcore band Ceremony has covered the song.  The Who Boys have done a mashup of "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" by Gil Scott-Heron called "Revolution Über Alles".  John Linnell and his band The Statesmen covered it live at least once during his "State Songs" tour\, choosing to perform it because it mentioned the state of California.  Dramarama has recorded a version\, updated in 2003 about California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger... "You will lift weights in school".  A 1986 live recording focused on Ronald Reagan on the album Mutiny On The Bay with live recordings from 1982 and 1986.  Jayne County covered the song with She Wolves about California's Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The green vinyl single was released under artist name Jayne County Meets The She Wolves by the German label Trash 2001.  Mexican death metal band Brujería covers Dead Kennedys with the song "California Uber Aztlan" in 2010. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

It was released on their debut album A Flock of Seagulls in 1982 and was its most successful single\, reaching number 9 in the United States and number 1 in Australia.  Single  The single was promoted by a distinctive music video in which the band members performed in a room covered in aluminum foil and mirrors. The cameras used to film the video are clearly visible in many of the background reflections\, their stands also covered in foil. The video is a homage to Brian Eno and Robert Fripp's (No Pussyfooting) album cover\, which was also respectively portrayed by The Strokes for their single\, "The End Has No End" two decades later. The video received heavy rotation on MTV in the summer of 1982\, and helped the single to become a hit. The video features a different edit of "I Ran" than the album version; the introduction was greatly shortened.  The band toured the United States extensively to promote the single\, supporting Squeeze on their 1982 tour. As well as reaching #9 on the Billboard Hot 100\, "I Ran" peaked at #3 on the Mainstream Rock chart and #8 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. Subsequently the album reached number 10 on the Billboard 200.  Despite success in the States and Australia\, the single did not enjoy similar success in the band's home country (United Kingdom)\, failing to make the top 40.  In an interview on the VH1 special 100 Greatest Songs of the '80s\, Mike Score said that he resents the song\, but plays it live because people enjoy it. "I Ran" was listed at #55 on the countdown. In VH1's 100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders of the 80s\, the song was listed at #2\, with Mike Score's interview played again.  Although considered an '80s New Wave classic\, the song experienced somewhat of a revival in 2002 as the signature theme for the video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City; being played during the game's television commercials and during gameplay as one of the songs in the playlist for radio station Wave 103.  Along with the Bowling for Soup cover\, it was also used as the theme song for the English dub of the anime series Knights of the Zodiac which was later removed from the air during its first season.  The song briefly featured in the Dead Zone Season 2 episode 'Playing God'\, heard during a party scene. It can also be heard during a nightclub scene in the 2005 Nick Love film The Business.

COL title VAL Trouble Man COL performer VAL Mabel Mercer	COL video title VAL The Four Tunes I Sold My Heart To The Junkman Jubilee  5174 A COL description VAL DISCLAIMER: All rights reserved to the production companies and music labels that distributed and produced the music and performance respectively. I've only added the footage as a tribute for historical\, entertainment\, and creative purposes with no financial gain. Copyright infringement not intended.  The Four Tunes "I Sold My Heart To The Junkman" Jubilee 5174 A 1954  Here are The Four Tunes with their version of "I Sold My Heart To The Junkman." This is the 2nd pressing that was released in 1954 by Jubilee\, in the same year as the 1st pressing. A nice\, minty\, clean 78 for your enjoyment.  The 4 Tunes were probably the leading black Pop vocal group during the 1950s. Their origins can be traced back to a change of personnel in the Ink Spots. This requires a brief review of some events in the mid-40s. In June 1944\, during an engagement in Chicago\, Hoppy Jones became ill and the group had to finish a tour without him (Deek Watson filled in on the mandatory talking parts). This had unsuspected ramifications. Hoppy was the conciliatory father figure (nicknamed "the grand old man") of the Ink Spots. Now that he was missing\, infighting between Bill Kenny and Deek Watson\, which had formerly just smoldered\, now flared up unchecked. Deek had been the leader of the group until their 1939 smash of "If I Didn't Care." Since then\, Bill had firmly established himself in the forefront of the Ink Spots\, pushing Deek further and further into the background. Hoppy returned in August\, but by then\, the damage had been done.  When he announced (in the January 1945 settlement of the lawsuits) that he would form a new group based "on a completely new idea\," he simply changed their name to the "Brown Dots" (the name does sound somewhat familiar\, doesn't it?). As it turned out\, the "new idea" was to sound as much like the Ink Spots as possible. One real difference was that the Brown Dots relied more on harmony than the Ink Spots\, who were more individualists. (Since the Brown Dots were also managed by Moe Gale\, we know who the hands-down winner in this contest was.)  The polished style of the 4 Tunes was the product of their training\, experience\, dedication\, and discipline. Their songs were carefully selected and arranged. Their first arranger was pianist Ralph Herman\, who was the youngest member of Paul Whiteman's Orchestra. They also worked with Howard Biggs (whose most famous association was with the Ravens).  In mid-1953\, they once again changed labels (since they weren't making any royalties from RCA). This time they went to Jerry Blaine's Jubilee label\, where they achieved their greatest popularity. Their first Jubilee recording\, "Marie\," was released in September\, and reached #2 on the R&B charts (#13 Pop). This Irving Berlin tune had been a #1 smash for Tommy Dorsey (Jack Leonard on vocal) back in 1937. ("Marie" was such a big hit that the purely R&B Dominoes and Larks were pushed to sing in the same kind of Pop mold.) Their next Jubilee release\, "I Understand Just How You Feel" was an even bigger hit\, climbing to #6 on the Pop charts (#7 R&B).  1954 saw two releases on the Kay-Ron label. These were old Manor cuts (although different takes). Two of them were backups to Savannah Churchill ("Savannah Sings The Blues" and "I Want To Be Loved"). The other two were "Just In Case You Change Your Mind" (which was actually by the Brown Dots) and "I Understand" (which was presumably released to confuse record buyers into thinking it was the same song as the current "I Understand Just How You Feel").  On Jubilee\, the 4 Tunes were primarily a Pop group (although they did turn out something called "Rock N Roll Call"). Their output included "Don't Cry Darling\," "L'amour\, Toujours L'amour\," "I Sold My Heart To The Junkman\," "Time Out For Tears\," "You Are My Love\," "Far Away Places\," "Dancing With Tears In My Eyes\," "Sayonara\," and "A Little On The Lonely Side."  The 4 Tunes appeared for a week at the Apollo Theater (beginning April 2\, 1955)\, along with Red Prysock's Orchestra. They played both the black theater circuit and also many white clubs. When they were on a tour with Joni James\, she asked Jimmie Nabbie to write a song for her. The result\, "You Are My Love\," was her big hit of 1955 (which the 4 Tunes covered).  In 1955\, the 4 Tunes were booked into the Hacienda in Las Vegas on a handshake\, and stayed for eight years. Other members\, added at the time\, were Smiley Hightower (guitar and bassist) and Eddie Williams (bassist; formerly of Johnny Moore's Three Blazers). Also\, tenor Billy Wells (from Deek's second Brown Dots group) was hired so that each of the other members could go on vacation on a rotating basis.

Lo que atrae de los covers como siempre e dicho\, es la curiosidad de como se escucha tal cancion con tal vocalista\, el morbo de escuchar una cancion tocada por diferentes personas.  Para disfrutar de este recopilatoria\, tienes que quitarte la imagen de como es la cancion\, no esperes algo igual o "muy parecido"\, recordemos que cada musico aporta algo que hace unica cualquier cancion\, ya sea un cover como es este caso.  Como se observa en la track list\, hay una gran variedad de musicos\, entre ellos vi a Paul Di'anno\, que como todos saben fue ex-integrante de Iron Maiden\, no podian faltar Lemmy o Ripper\, tambien veo a chuck de testament\, tambien esta Chris Jericho de WWE que la neta yo ni sabia que tenia una banda.  En fin hay para todos los gustos\, lo unico malo que vi en el disco es que faltaron algunos temas. COL channel name VAL el juanito	0

Well the both 12" versions low down and girl you are the one are just as long as the album versions. Alfonzo was a great singer\, with some good songs\, but to my opinion\, they should have launched him as an artist in his own right and not just a copycat of Michal Jackson. This last fact was surely true for his looks. Sadly enough he faded away from the scene\, maybe a wrong choice of managment or something like that. He was a great singer! This song is an absolutely favourite of mine! Anyone knows what happend to him? COL channel name VAL peterpiessens	0

Similar to the original and could catch a piece. Rated 81 out of 100".  Written by L. Wolfe Gilbert.   B-side is "Ivory Rag" by Joe "Fingers" Carr and the Carr-Hops.

COL title VAL Watcha Gonna Do About It COL performer VAL Dan McCafferty	COL video title VAL ELLIE POP - WHATCHA GONNA DO ABOUT IT.wmv COL description VAL ELLIE POP - 'Watcha Gonna Do 'Bout It' (Mainstream S-6115) 1968  Before I started collecting original 60s garage/psych 45s I spent decades buying (mostly) original and re-issue albums and one of my early purchases was this obscurity by Ellie Pop on Mainstream Records. This album is hard to find and commands a decent price tag but it was re-issued a few years ago and should now be available to a larger audience at last.  In my opinion Ellie Pop were treading their own path in 1968\, there's no fuzz\, no psych touches\, no 1968isms of heavy guitars and keyboards. What you get is a collection of beautifully constructed pop songs that suggest a big Anglophile influence\, in particular mid-60s period Beatles. They sound similar to say The Merry-Go-Round or The Left Banke but without the baroque touches. Just pure pop\, or should I say Ellie Pop.  Virtually every review I've read online or in Shindig for instance\, fails to mention that 'Whatcha Gonna Do 'Bout It' is a cover of a Hollies cut they recorded in 1963 for their debut album 'Stay With The Hollies.' Ellie Pop wrote all of their own tunes except this one!  I'm not certain where Ellie Pop hailed from or even the full names of the group members but it has been suggested elsewhere that they were from Detroit. Maybe someone can confirm this?  http://expo67-cavestones.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/ellie-pop-whatcha-gonna-do-bout-it.html COL channel name VAL ACID REVOLVER	1

COL title VAL (Just Like) Starting Over COL performer VAL Kat Edmonson	COL video title VAL Billy Williams - Nola (1959) COL description VAL Charted at #39 on Billboard Hot 100 in January 1959. You don't often hear a vocal version of this song. This was Billy's penultimate chart entry\, the last being "Goodnight\, Irene" (#75 in April 1959). It was a #3 hit for Vincent Lopez and His Orchestra in July 1922 (I've also posted this version). Also #9 for Les Paul in June 1950 (which I've posted too)\, Original Billboard review: "An ingratiating chanting stint by Williams marks this updated version of the evergreen. The lyrics are cute and the artist is at his best. Spins should please."   Written by Felix Arndt and Sunny Skylar.   B-side is "Tied to the Strings of Your Heart". COL channel name VAL CatsPjamas1	0

Que j'me démène ou qu'je reste coi Je passe pour un je-ne-sais-quoi  Je ne fais pourtant de tort à  personne En suivant mon chemin de petit bonhomme. Mais les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Non les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Tout le monde médit de moi\, Sauf les muets\, ça va de soi.  Le jour du Quatorze Juillet Je reste dans mon lit douillet. La musique qui marche au pas\, Cela ne me regarde pas.  Je ne fais pourtant de tort à  personne\, En n'écoutant pas le clairon qui sonne. Mais les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Non les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Tout le monde me montre du doigt Sauf les manchots\, ça va de soi.  Quand j'croise un voleur malchanceux\, Poursuivi par un cul-terreux; J'lance la patte et pourquoi le taire\, Le cul-terreux s'retrouve par terre  Je ne fais pourtant de tort à  personne\, En laissant courir les voleurs de pommes. Mais les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Non les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Tout le monde se rue sur moi\, Sauf les culs-de-jatte\, ça va de soi.  Pas besoin d'être Jérémie\, Pour d'viner l'sort qui m'est promis\, S'ils trouvent une corde à  leur goût\, Ils me la passeront au cou\,  Je ne fais pourtant de tort à  personne\, En suivant les ch'mins qui n'mènent pas à  Rome\, Mais les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Non les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Tout l'mond' viendra me voir pendu\, Sauf les aveugles\, bien entendu.

COL title VAL Sexbomb COL performer VAL Black Ingvars	COL video title VAL ELLIE POP - WHATCHA GONNA DO ABOUT IT.wmv COL description VAL ELLIE POP - 'Watcha Gonna Do 'Bout It' (Mainstream S-6115) 1968  Before I started collecting original 60s garage/psych 45s I spent decades buying (mostly) original and re-issue albums and one of my early purchases was this obscurity by Ellie Pop on Mainstream Records. This album is hard to find and commands a decent price tag but it was re-issued a few years ago and should now be available to a larger audience at last.  In my opinion Ellie Pop were treading their own path in 1968\, there's no fuzz\, no psych touches\, no 1968isms of heavy guitars and keyboards. What you get is a collection of beautifully constructed pop songs that suggest a big Anglophile influence\, in particular mid-60s period Beatles. They sound similar to say The Merry-Go-Round or The Left Banke but without the baroque touches. Just pure pop\, or should I say Ellie Pop.  Virtually every review I've read online or in Shindig for instance\, fails to mention that 'Whatcha Gonna Do 'Bout It' is a cover of a Hollies cut they recorded in 1963 for their debut album 'Stay With The Hollies.' Ellie Pop wrote all of their own tunes except this one!  I'm not certain where Ellie Pop hailed from or even the full names of the group members but it has been suggested elsewhere that they were from Detroit. Maybe someone can confirm this?  http://expo67-cavestones.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/ellie-pop-whatcha-gonna-do-bout-it.html COL channel name VAL ACID REVOLVER	0

COL description VAL Introduced and originally recorded by Sister Rosetta Tharpe & Marie Knight\, way back in 1948\, it eventually made it into Hovie Lister and The Statesmen Quartet's repertoire. Elvis liked it so much that he included a portion of the song in a medley of gospel songs on his '68 Comeback Special. Everyone sings a bit on this song\, but Jake Hess (lead) and "The Big Chief" (bass) really shine in the middle and on the end. This is the kind of song you'd expect to hear at an all night sing!

COL title VAL Shelter from the Storm COL performer VAL Hans Theessink & Terry Evans	COL video title VAL Eddy Arnold -- Seven Years With The Wrong Woman (VintageMusic.es) COL description VAL Eddy Arnold\, nacido el 15 de mayo de 1918 en la localidad de Henderson\, condado de Chester\, Tennessee y fallecido el 8 de mayo de 2008 en Franklin\, condado de Williamson\, Tennessee debido a una enfermedad\, fue un músico estadounidense\, especialmente volcado a la música country\, cuyo verdadero nombre era Richard Edward Arnold. Entre su debut en el mundo de la música en 1945 y 1954\, Eddie logró 58 top ten consecutivos\, y nunca marcó menos de un top 40 durante sus 21 años de carrera\, con más de 140 discos diferentes de los cuales se vendieron más de 85 millones de copias\, incluidos eternos clásicos como Bouquet de Rosas o Anytime. Recibió el apodo de Tennessee Plowboy (el chico del arado de Tennessee en inglés)\, y firmó contratos con las compañías discográficas RCA Records y MGM Records.  Richard Edward Arnold nació en Henderson\, en el condado de Chester\, estado de Tennessee\, el 15 de mayo de 1918 y se educó en el medio rural. Su padre era un violinista que alentó a su hijo respecto del desarrollo de sus talentos musicales y logró reunir el dinero suficiente para comprar a su niño una guitarra a la edad de 10 años. Para cuando entró en la escuela secundaria Eddie Arnols ya era toda una estrella local\, pero con la llegada de la Gran Depresión en 1929 y la crisis económica de los años 1930\, Eddy tuvo que dejar la escuela para ayudar trabajar como asistente en una funeraria. Relegó sus actuaciones musicales a funciones locales\, aunque de vez en cuando viajaba montado en una mula con su guitarra a la espalda.  Al igual que otros artistas del country de la época\, Eddy consiguió su pase al estrellato con sus apariciones en vivo por la radio\, antes de debutar en Jackson\, en Tennessee\, en 1936 y posteriormente en San Luis\, en el estado de Misuri.  Entre 1940 y 1943 apareció en el Grand Ole Opry junto a Pee Wee King. Apodado como el chico del arado de Tennessee (o Tennessee Plowboy\, en inglés) firmó con la RCA Victor Records un contrato en 1944 con ese nombre\, que fue el que apareció en sus discos hasta 1954. Con el tema Every hour Seems A Million Years alcanzó el quinto disco de su carrera\, dando con dicho disco comienzo a la cadena de 58 consecutivos éxitos top ten. En 1947 Arnold logró sus tres primeros éxitos número uno\, siendo uno de ellos número uno durante 21 semanas. Eddy Arnold realizó temas universalmente populares convirtiéndose en una estrella perenne\, grabando discos durante un período de cinco décadas\, desde los años 1960 hasta los años 1980; tras una pausa de siete años incluso regresó al estudio en 1990.  Además de establecer un nivel inigualable dada su avanzada edad\, Arnold se convirtió en un ejemplo de cómo manejar su fortuna en el mundo del espectáculo. "Guardo mi primer dólar y sigo ahorrando e invirtiendo mi dinero"\, recuerda\, "nunca olvidé cómo se sentía ser pobre"\, añadió. Eddie Anold se convirtió en uno de los hombres más ricos de la industria mediante la inversión en la única cosa que él consideraba de valor de propiedad\, "la tierra". Debido a su enorme popularidad musical Eddy Arnold se convirtió en un auténtico embajador de la música country a nivel mundial   Spotify:http://open.spotify.com/album/4tQOsxLgCwxPCRNS5LeWxN iTunes:http://itunes.apple.com/es/album/vintage-country-no-11-ep-all/id374306958 Síguenos en: Spotify: https://goo.gl/raouHQ Facebook: https://goo.gl/L92BHL Instagram: https://goo.gl/3oYDGH Web: http://www.vintagemusic.es   Compra nuestros Cd's en formato físico en estas plataformas: Ebay:  http://stores.ebay.com/VintageMusicFm BoutiqAlia: www.boutiqalia-vintagemusic.com Discogs: https://www.discogs.com/es/seller/vintagemusicfm/profile COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm	0

Dette er en sang som jeg liker veldig godt og som betyr veldig mye for meg. ___________________________________  Ja fysst så vil je nevne min stilling og min stæinn\, je står og svarver hatter i Salomo sitt læinn. Sjøl bær je navnet Jørgen\, så skilnaden er stor\, men både je og Salomo kom nakne tel vår jord.  Refr.:  Sola skin på deg så skuggen fell på meg men graset er grønt for æille.  Når liljene på marken i fager blomstring står\, og alle himlens fugler sin glade trille slår\, je nynne såmmå strofa i hattemakergrenn\, og morgendagen\, Salomo\, hva vet vel vi om den?  Refr.  Har Salomo sitt måltid med vin og fylte fat\, je sug på harde skorper og kæille det for mat\, men det vi gir ifrå øss di vi i lønndom går blir gras til hyrdens hvite lam og Sarons sorte får.  Refr.  Når dronningen av Saba gjør Salomo visitt\, je ser a "Lea Lettvint" og hu har tenkt seg hit. Om leiet blir forskjellig frå silkeseng tel strå\, vi går mot såmmå paradis og hører harper slå.  Refr.  Når sola synk og dale bak slottets tårn og tind\, så kjæm den mørke natta med drøm og tankespinn\, der blir je sjøl Kong Salomo og hæin blir kænskje den som står og svarver hatter uti hattemakergrenn.

Buy your SIGNED copy here: http://stix-shop.dk/ More info: http://www.pasborg.dk/  ''Stefan Pasborg is yet another Nordic artist gradually raising his profile across international borders as he leads his new five-piece outfit around Europe.... Most pieces exploited the players' individual virtuosity\, but in principle the writing for the group emphasized collectivity rather than individuality\, always knitted tightly by Pasborg's strong drumming.... Odessa 5 is certainly a band to be blown away by''  - All About Jazz\, USA.   Stefan Pasborg's band Odessa ''X-tra Large'' features some of the finest musicians on the Nordic jazz scenes. Musicians that aren't afraid to cross new musical land. Together they play some seriously exiting multi-jazz. The bodily and the imagination is the main focus\, and you have to travel all the way back in time to Charles Mingus to find the same kind of energy. There is not so much more to say other than when the musicians are having fun\, as they so obviously have in this case\, then the listener has as well. COL channel name VAL copentube	0

Aside from some intriguing collaborations – with Laurie Anderson on This Is The Picture\, Kate Bush on Don’t Give Up and Youssou N’Dour on In Your Eyes – it was the unity of singer\, band and producer that made So such a crucial record in the Gabriel canon.  # http://www.petergabriel.com  Red rain is coming down Red rain Red rain is pouring down Pouring down all over me  I am standing up at the water's edge in my dream I cannot make a single sound as you scream it can't be that cold\, the ground is still warm to touch (Hay ay ay we touch) This place is so quiet sensing that storm  Red rain is coming down Red rain Red rain is pouring down Pouring down all over me  Well I've seen them buried in a sheltered place in this town They tell you that this rain can sting\, and look down There is no blood around See no sign of pain Hay ay ay no pain Seeing no red at all\, see no rain  Red rain is coming down Red rain Red rain is pouring down Pouring down all over me  Red rain Putting the pressure on much harder now To return again and again  Just let the red rain splash you Let the rain fall on your skin I come to you defences down With the trust of a child  Red rain coming down Red rain Red rain is pouring down Pouring down all over me And I can't watch anymore  No more denial It's so hard to lay down in all of this Red rain coming down Red rain is pouring down Red rain is coming down all over me  I see it Red rain coming down Red rain is pouring down Red rain is coming down all over me I'm bathing in Red rain coming down Red rain is coming down Red rain is coming down all over me I'm begging you Red rain coming down Red rain coming down Red rain coming down Red rain coming down Over me in the red red sea Over me\, over me\, red rain  Written by Peter Gabriel  Published by Real World Music Ltd / Sony ATV  #MusicVideo COL channel name VAL Peter Gabriel	0

It was released on their debut album A Flock of Seagulls in 1982 and was its most successful single\, reaching number 9 in the United States and number 1 in Australia.  Single  The single was promoted by a distinctive music video in which the band members performed in a room covered in aluminum foil and mirrors. The cameras used to film the video are clearly visible in many of the background reflections\, their stands also covered in foil. The video is a homage to Brian Eno and Robert Fripp's (No Pussyfooting) album cover\, which was also respectively portrayed by The Strokes for their single\, "The End Has No End" two decades later. The video received heavy rotation on MTV in the summer of 1982\, and helped the single to become a hit. The video features a different edit of "I Ran" than the album version; the introduction was greatly shortened.  The band toured the United States extensively to promote the single\, supporting Squeeze on their 1982 tour. As well as reaching #9 on the Billboard Hot 100\, "I Ran" peaked at #3 on the Mainstream Rock chart and #8 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. Subsequently the album reached number 10 on the Billboard 200.  Despite success in the States and Australia\, the single did not enjoy similar success in the band's home country (United Kingdom)\, failing to make the top 40.  In an interview on the VH1 special 100 Greatest Songs of the '80s\, Mike Score said that he resents the song\, but plays it live because people enjoy it. "I Ran" was listed at #55 on the countdown. In VH1's 100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders of the 80s\, the song was listed at #2\, with Mike Score's interview played again.  Although considered an '80s New Wave classic\, the song experienced somewhat of a revival in 2002 as the signature theme for the video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City; being played during the game's television commercials and during gameplay as one of the songs in the playlist for radio station Wave 103.  Along with the Bowling for Soup cover\, it was also used as the theme song for the English dub of the anime series Knights of the Zodiac which was later removed from the air during its first season.  The song briefly featured in the Dead Zone Season 2 episode 'Playing God'\, heard during a party scene. It can also be heard during a nightclub scene in the 2005 Nick Love film The Business.  The master recording is available as a playable song in Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s as well as the rebooted version of Karaoke Revolution. The song was from the TV show Everybody Hates Chris entitled Everybody Hates the Last Day  It was performed by the Ska Rangers in the film The Hangover: Part II during the closing scene.  Also\, Fez sung a verse in That 70's Show during one of the "Circles" in the fourth season's opener.  Cover versions  "I Ran" has been covered by a number of artists:  Tori Amos covered the song on her Original Sinsuality/Summer Of Sin Tour in Denver\, during Piano Bar Time. Her version was released with the rest of the show in the 3rd CD of The Original Bootlegs.  Assemblage 23 recorded the song for the 1997 compilation Newer Wave.  Cranial Screwtop recorded a version of the song for their 2006 album "Too Fast for Technology".  Terminal Choice's cover of the song is included on the bonus disk of their 2006 album New Born Enemies.  Bowling for Soup covered the song for the 2003 re-release of their album Drunk Enough to Dance and their "Punk Rock 101" single. Both the original and the punk cover are the theme song of the American version of Saint Seiya\, also known as Knights of the Zodiac.  Hidden in Plain View recorded the song on the covers compilation album Punk Goes 80s.  In Dance Dance Revolution: Hottest Party 2\, Spacebar vs Naughty G covered this song.  Darude and Blake Lewis released a cover in 2008.  Nickelback covered the song during their Dark Horse Tour in 2010. It was sung by guitarist/vocalist Ryan Peake.  Slim Thug also took the bass line of this song to produce his single "I Run"  Umphrey's Mcgee covered the song during a performance at the Birmingham Southern College on 4/9/05\, however they have played it many times before.  Ska Rangers covered the song which featured on the film and soundtrack of The Hangover: Part II. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

I've only added the footage as a tribute for historical\, entertainment\, and creative purposes with no financial gain. Copyright infringement not intended.  The Four Tunes "I Sold My Heart To The Junkman" Jubilee 5174 A 1954  Here are The Four Tunes with their version of "I Sold My Heart To The Junkman." This is the 2nd pressing that was released in 1954 by Jubilee\, in the same year as the 1st pressing. A nice\, minty\, clean 78 for your enjoyment.  The 4 Tunes were probably the leading black Pop vocal group during the 1950s. Their origins can be traced back to a change of personnel in the Ink Spots. This requires a brief review of some events in the mid-40s. In June 1944\, during an engagement in Chicago\, Hoppy Jones became ill and the group had to finish a tour without him (Deek Watson filled in on the mandatory talking parts). This had unsuspected ramifications. Hoppy was the conciliatory father figure (nicknamed "the grand old man") of the Ink Spots. Now that he was missing\, infighting between Bill Kenny and Deek Watson\, which had formerly just smoldered\, now flared up unchecked. Deek had been the leader of the group until their 1939 smash of "If I Didn't Care." Since then\, Bill had firmly established himself in the forefront of the Ink Spots\, pushing Deek further and further into the background. Hoppy returned in August\, but by then\, the damage had been done.  When he announced (in the January 1945 settlement of the lawsuits) that he would form a new group based "on a completely new idea\," he simply changed their name to the "Brown Dots" (the name does sound somewhat familiar\, doesn't it?). As it turned out\, the "new idea" was to sound as much like the Ink Spots as possible. One real difference was that the Brown Dots relied more on harmony than the Ink Spots\, who were more individualists. (Since the Brown Dots were also managed by Moe Gale\, we know who the hands-down winner in this contest was.)  The polished style of the 4 Tunes was the product of their training\, experience\, dedication\, and discipline. Their songs were carefully selected and arranged. Their first arranger was pianist Ralph Herman\, who was the youngest member of Paul Whiteman's Orchestra. They also worked with Howard Biggs (whose most famous association was with the Ravens).  In mid-1953\, they once again changed labels (since they weren't making any royalties from RCA). This time they went to Jerry Blaine's Jubilee label\, where they achieved their greatest popularity. Their first Jubilee recording\, "Marie\," was released in September\, and reached #2 on the R&B charts (#13 Pop). This Irving Berlin tune had been a #1 smash for Tommy Dorsey (Jack Leonard on vocal) back in 1937. ("Marie" was such a big hit that the purely R&B Dominoes and Larks were pushed to sing in the same kind of Pop mold.) Their next Jubilee release\, "I Understand Just How You Feel" was an even bigger hit\, climbing to #6 on the Pop charts (#7 R&B).  1954 saw two releases on the Kay-Ron label. These were old Manor cuts (although different takes). Two of them were backups to Savannah Churchill ("Savannah Sings The Blues" and "I Want To Be Loved"). The other two were "Just In Case You Change Your Mind" (which was actually by the Brown Dots) and "I Understand" (which was presumably released to confuse record buyers into thinking it was the same song as the current "I Understand Just How You Feel").  On Jubilee\, the 4 Tunes were primarily a Pop group (although they did turn out something called "Rock N Roll Call"). Their output included "Don't Cry Darling\," "L'amour\, Toujours L'amour\," "I Sold My Heart To The Junkman\," "Time Out For Tears\," "You Are My Love\," "Far Away Places\," "Dancing With Tears In My Eyes\," "Sayonara\," and "A Little On The Lonely Side."  The 4 Tunes appeared for a week at the Apollo Theater (beginning April 2\, 1955)\, along with Red Prysock's Orchestra. They played both the black theater circuit and also many white clubs. When they were on a tour with Joni James\, she asked Jimmie Nabbie to write a song for her. The result\, "You Are My Love\," was her big hit of 1955 (which the 4 Tunes covered).  In 1955\, the 4 Tunes were booked into the Hacienda in Las Vegas on a handshake\, and stayed for eight years. Other members\, added at the time\, were Smiley Hightower (guitar and bassist) and Eddie Williams (bassist; formerly of Johnny Moore's Three Blazers). Also\, tenor Billy Wells (from Deek's second Brown Dots group) was hired so that each of the other members could go on vacation on a rotating basis.

As we drove on thru the rain As he listened I explained And he left me with a prayer That I'd find you    Disclaimer:  NO COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT INTENDED!

COL title VAL Non mi dir COL performer VAL Adriano Celentano e I Ribelli	COL video title VAL Joanie Sommers – “Step Inside Love” (Happy Tiger) 1968 COL description VAL Written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Arranged by  Capps and produced by Joseph Porter.  Joanie\, who scored a #7 US hit with “Johnny Get Angry” in the summer of 1962\, didn’t return to Hot-100 after “When The Boys Get Together” charted in October of the same year.  Some great records followed on Warners\, however\, including the northern soul favorite\, “Don’t Pity Me” in 1965. By 1967\, Joanie was with Columbia and following year with Capitol but still the hits continued to elude her – notwithstanding the quality of her recordings.  “Step Inside Love” had been a #8 UK hit for Cilla Black during Cilla’s ten year chart run from the early 60s.  The Happy Tiger label was owned by the Flying Tiger Line\, an air freight company. The label ran from 1968-71 and was home to artists such as Donnie Brooks\, Priscilla Paris and Them.

Was the singer for several different bands in the 1920s\, including the Colonial Club Orchestra and The Regents Club Orchestra. He disappeared from public view in 1934 when he was laid off from work in the record industry as an executive and then genuinely disappeared for good\, because no one knows what happened to him after that. This was one of his biggest hits\, charting at #25 in 1930 for the year. Also a big(ger) hit for Nat Skrillet in the same year.  Photo is of the Regents Club Dance Hall In Brighton\, England. It was converted to a bingo hall in 1967 and then bulldozed in 1974\, a victim of changing taste in dance music.  50 hits on 9/26/11 100 hits on 11/10/11 250 hits on 3/16/12 500 htis on 9/6/12 COL channel name VAL MusicProjectX	1

COL title VAL No Place to Fall COL performer VAL Isobel Campbell & Mark Lanegan	COL video title VAL DENI HINES & CHRISTINE ANU - TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS COL description VAL Two of Australias most loved and successful female recording artists\, Deni Hines and Christine Anu\, are takin it to the streets again in 2009 after the success of their 2008 East-Coast of Australia tour.    On the first tour we had such a great time\, that we wanted to do it all over again\, especially when we have such a great cause to promote such as the Salvation Army and Oasis Youth Support Network. We feel privileged to be able to help says Christine & Deni.    In a two hour show\, this sassy duo will perform their classic hits and favourite timeless songs along with some special duets\, including their own rendition of the Doobie Brothers hit TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS.   While promoting their 2008 tour\, Deni and Christine so happened to be performing one of their show duets TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS on the Today Show (Nine Network\, Australia). On the same show was a heartfelt segment about the plight of homelessness in Australia accompanied by Captain Paul Mould of the Salvation Armys Oasis Youth Support Network\, who take care and provide much needed services for the homeless and youth of Australia (who come from all walks of life.)  No less than 5 minutes after walking off set\, Christine and Deni turned to each other and said weve got to do something to help and the recording of TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS was set in motion.   Deni and Christine will release their version of TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS on 15 November 2008 (Nationwide) with fifty percent (50%) of profits going to the Salvation Armys Youth Homelessness Oasis Foundation and the Everyone Is Homeless Fund.  On Wednesday\, 17th December Christine and Deni will also stage a free Christmas concert version of their TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS show exclusively for the Salvation Armys Youth Homelessness Oasis Foundation and the homeless people of Sydney.   For further information on Salvation Armys Youth Homelessness Oasis Foundation and the Everyone Is Homeless Fund\, please refer to www.oasis.salvos.org.au  In the ABS Census 2001 (The 2006 Census data has not been finalized)\, there were 100\,000 homeless people (men\, women and children) across Australia\, one third (36\,173) are youth between 12-24 years of age.  Only 14.25% of homeless people were able to stay in services funded through SAAP (Supported Accommodation Assistance Program) jointly funded by both the Commonwealth and State Governments.  Christine and Deni would like to thank the following companies and people for donating their time and services free of charge of the purposes of this donation campaign drive -  301 Studios\, Sing Sing Studios\, David and Anthony @ DNA Songs\, Tony Espie\, David Walker at Stepford Audio\, John Adams\, Franco Raggatt\, Barbara Griffin\, Cameron Undy\, Michael Rohanek and Rob Thompson.

It was released on their debut album A Flock of Seagulls in 1982 and was its most successful single\, reaching number 9 in the United States and number 1 in Australia.  Single  The single was promoted by a distinctive music video in which the band members performed in a room covered in aluminum foil and mirrors. The cameras used to film the video are clearly visible in many of the background reflections\, their stands also covered in foil. The video is a homage to Brian Eno and Robert Fripp's (No Pussyfooting) album cover\, which was also respectively portrayed by The Strokes for their single\, "The End Has No End" two decades later. The video received heavy rotation on MTV in the summer of 1982\, and helped the single to become a hit. The video features a different edit of "I Ran" than the album version; the introduction was greatly shortened.  The band toured the United States extensively to promote the single\, supporting Squeeze on their 1982 tour. As well as reaching #9 on the Billboard Hot 100\, "I Ran" peaked at #3 on the Mainstream Rock chart and #8 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. Subsequently the album reached number 10 on the Billboard 200.  Despite success in the States and Australia\, the single did not enjoy similar success in the band's home country (United Kingdom)\, failing to make the top 40.  In an interview on the VH1 special 100 Greatest Songs of the '80s\, Mike Score said that he resents the song\, but plays it live because people enjoy it. "I Ran" was listed at #55 on the countdown. In VH1's 100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders of the 80s\, the song was listed at #2\, with Mike Score's interview played again.  Although considered an '80s New Wave classic\, the song experienced somewhat of a revival in 2002 as the signature theme for the video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City; being played during the game's television commercials and during gameplay as one of the songs in the playlist for radio station Wave 103.  Along with the Bowling for Soup cover\, it was also used as the theme song for the English dub of the anime series Knights of the Zodiac which was later removed from the air during its first season.  The song briefly featured in the Dead Zone Season 2 episode 'Playing God'\, heard during a party scene. It can also be heard during a nightclub scene in the 2005 Nick Love film The Business.  The master recording is available as a playable song in Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s as well as the rebooted version of Karaoke Revolution. The song was from the TV show Everybody Hates Chris entitled Everybody Hates the Last Day  It was performed by the Ska Rangers in the film The Hangover: Part II during the closing scene.  Also\, Fez sung a verse in That 70's Show during one of the "Circles" in the fourth season's opener.  Cover versions  "I Ran" has been covered by a number of artists:  Tori Amos covered the song on her Original Sinsuality/Summer Of Sin Tour in Denver\, during Piano Bar Time. Her version was released with the rest of the show in the 3rd CD of The Original Bootlegs.  Assemblage 23 recorded the song for the 1997 compilation Newer Wave.  Cranial Screwtop recorded a version of the song for their 2006 album "Too Fast for Technology".  Terminal Choice's cover of the song is included on the bonus disk of their 2006 album New Born Enemies.  Bowling for Soup covered the song for the 2003 re-release of their album Drunk Enough to Dance and their "Punk Rock 101" single. Both the original and the punk cover are the theme song of the American version of Saint Seiya\, also known as Knights of the Zodiac.  Hidden in Plain View recorded the song on the covers compilation album Punk Goes 80s.  In Dance Dance Revolution: Hottest Party 2\, Spacebar vs Naughty G covered this song.  Darude and Blake Lewis released a cover in 2008.  Nickelback covered the song during their Dark Horse Tour in 2010. It was sung by guitarist/vocalist Ryan Peake.  Slim Thug also took the bass line of this song to produce his single "I Run"  Umphrey's Mcgee covered the song during a performance at the Birmingham Southern College on 4/9/05\, however they have played it many times before.  Ska Rangers covered the song which featured on the film and soundtrack of The Hangover: Part II. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

COL title VAL Les yeux bleus COL performer VAL Sacha Distel	COL video title VAL A.R. Scammell The Squid Jiggin' Ground Part 1 (with lyrics) COL description VAL Oh\, this is the place where the fishermen gather\,  With oilskins and boots and Cape Anns battened down;  All sizes of figures with squid lines and jiggers\,  They congregate here on the squid-jigging ground.   Some are workin' their jiggers while others are yarnin'\,  There's some standin' up and there's more lyin' down;  While all kinds of fun\, jokes and tricks are begun  As they wait for the squid on the squid-jiggin' ground.   There's men of all ages and boys in the bargain;  There's old Billy Cave and there's young Raymond Brown\,  There's a red rantin' Tory out here in a dory\,  A-runnin' down Squires on the squid-jiggin' ground.   There's men from the Harbour and men from the Tickle\,  In all kinds of motorboats\, green\, grey and brown;  Right yonder is Bobby and with him is Nobby\,  He's chawin' hard tack on the squid-jiggin' ground.   God bless my sou'wester\, there's Skipper John Chaffey\,  He's the best hand at squid-jiggin' here\, I'll be bound.  Hello! What's the row? Why he's jiggin' one now\,  The very first squid on the squid-jiggin' ground.   The man with the whiskers is old Jacob Steele;  He's gettin well up but he's still pretty sound.  While Uncle Bob Hawkins wears six pair o' stockin's  Whenever he's out on the squid-jiggin' ground.   Holy smoke! What a scuffle! All hands are excited.  'Tis a wonder to me that there's nobody drowned.  There's confusion\, a bustle\, a wonderful hustle\,  They're all jiggin' squids on the squid-jiggin' ground.   Says Bobby\, "The squids are on top of the water\,  I just got me jigger 'bout one fathom down" ---  When a squid in the boat squirted right down his throat\,  And he's swearin' like mad on the squid-jiggin' ground.   There's poor Uncle Billy\, his whiskers are spattered  With spots of the squid juice that's flying around;  One poor little b'y got it right in the eye\,  But they don't give a damn on the squid-jiggin' ground.   Now if ever you feel inclined to go squiddin'\,  Leave your white shirts and collars behind in the town.  And if you get cranky without your silk hanky  You'd better steer clear of the squid-jiggin' ground.   Found in a used record store dollar bin in Sydney\, Cape Breton\, NS\, 2002.

Was the singer for several different bands in the 1920s\, including the Colonial Club Orchestra and The Regents Club Orchestra. He disappeared from public view in 1934 when he was laid off from work in the record industry as an executive and then genuinely disappeared for good\, because no one knows what happened to him after that. This was one of his biggest hits\, charting at #25 in 1930 for the year. Also a big(ger) hit for Nat Skrillet in the same year.  Photo is of the Regents Club Dance Hall In Brighton\, England. It was converted to a bingo hall in 1967 and then bulldozed in 1974\, a victim of changing taste in dance music.  50 hits on 9/26/11 100 hits on 11/10/11 250 hits on 3/16/12 500 htis on 9/6/12 COL channel name VAL MusicProjectX	0

In the prison cell I sit\, Thinking Mother dear of you\, And our bright and happy home so far away\, And the tears they fill my eyes Spite of all that I can do Though I try to cheer my comrades and be gay.  Chorus: Tramp! tramp! tramp! The boys are marching Cheer up comrades\, They will come. And beneath the starry flag We shall breathe the air again Of the free land in our own beloved home.  In the battle front we stood When their fiercest charge they made\, And they swept us off a hundred men or more; But before we reached their lines They were beaten back\, dismayed\, And we heard the cry of vict'ry o'er and o'er.  So within the prison cell We are waiting for the day That shall come to open wide the iron door; And the hollow eye grows bright And the poor heart almost gay As we think of seing home and friends once more.

I have a long working relationship with both Travis and J Bonner. J is brilliant reggae bass player that I’ve played with and worked with me on "Poet’s Life" and the Jimmy Cliff album. Travis is in the Transplants with me. I’m so fortunate to get to play with these guys. In the video\, there’s a shot of me standing on a garbage can on the corner of Durant and Telegraph\, in the distance you can see the church where my parents were married in 1958.

COL title VAL (Just Like) Starting Over COL performer VAL John Lennon	COL video title VAL BERT HEERINK STORM NA DE STILTE Rocksterren COL description VAL I DO NOT OWN THIS VIDEO. © (c)Copyright belongs to the rightful owner  Bert Heerink (Utrecht\, 26 januari 1953) is een Nederlandse muzikant. Heerink werd voornamelijk bekend als zanger van de Nederlandse hardrockband Vandenberg\, die ook internationaal succes had.Met Vandenberg had Heerink in de jaren 80 twee wereldhits: Burning Heart en Different Worlds. Nadat Vandenberg de samenwerking met Heerink beëindigde trad Bert toe tot de heavy metal band Picture en nam een aantal Nederlandstalige albums op. Bekend werd hij verder door in 1995 voor een aantal reclames voor Heineken Nederlandstalige teksten te zingen op melodieën van oude rocknummers. De nummers Zon in de Winter\, Doe wat je wil en Julie July werden hits. Voor het album Storm na de Stilte kreeg hij een gouden plaat.Bij de reünie van Kayak  in 2000 werd Heerink zanger van deze band en bleef dit tot 2006. In 2002 toert Bert met het orkest van de Koninklijke Luchtmacht door Nederland in de hoofdrol van "Tommy".Met Peter Groot Kormelink en Erik Mesie vormt Heerink het muzikale feestprogramma "De Heeren van Oranje" waarin alle grote hits van de 3 Heeren voorbij komen.Bert neemt in 2005/2006 ook vocalen voor zijn rekening tijdens de succesvolle tour van het orkest van Koninklijke Luchtmacht door de Nederlandse theaters: Queen in concert\, waarbij diverse Queen klassiekers worden vertolkt. Sommige nummers worden ook in een nieuw jasje gestoken\, zoals 'Crazy little thing called love'\, welke een big band sausje krijgt.In 2006 heeft Bert Heerink samen met zijn zus Saskia onder de naam Heerink een album uitgebracht met de naam Purify. Het album wordt gekenmerkt door een persoonlijke inslag.In 2007 en ook in 2008 maakte Heerink met het Noord Nederlands Orkest (NNO) onder leiding van de Belgische dirigent Dirk Brossé met het cross-overprogramma Symphonic echoes of Pink Floyd een tournee\, waarin de grote hits van de Engelse rockformatie centraal staan. Naast Heerink nemen Antonie Kamerling en Erik Mesie de zangpartijen voor hun rekening\, bijgestaan door onder meer gitarist Joost Vergoossen.Het wordt het tot dan toe best bezochte concertjaar met ruim 98.000 bezoekers. In 2008 vervangt Chris Zeegers Antonie Kamerling bij deze productie.Tegenwoordig (2006) woont Heerink in Hoogeveen. Recentelijk bracht Heerink de single "When I close my eyes"\, uit. De single is uitsluitend via de website www.bertheerink.nl te downloaden en de opbrengst gaat naar de stichting KidsRights die zich wereldwijd inzet voor de rechten van kinderen. Op 6 december 2008 ontving Bert Heerink het Lidmaatschap in de Orde van Oranje Nassau als waardering voor zijn inzet en prestaties in de popmuziek en zijn inzet voor de kinderrechtenorganisatie KidsRights. Eerder ontving Bert Heerink in Hoogeveen om dezelfde reden een eigen ster in de "Walk of Veen".In april 2009 brengt Heerink samen met collega's Erik Mesie en Peter Groot Kormelink onder de naam "Heeren van Oranje" hun eerste eigen single uit; "Made in Holland" waarmee ze landelijk debuteerden op het Tros Muziekfeest in Middelburg. In samenwerking met OAR Heaven Records werkt Bert vanaf mei 2009 in Duitsland in de studio van Michael Voss aan een volledig eigen Engelstalig rockalbum. De uitnodiging een dergelijk album te maken kwam na het meewerken aan het tweede "Voices of Rock" album waar Bert met "Shame on you" op vertegenwoordigd is. Het album komt op 25 september wereldwijd uit en bevat nummers van grote songwriters als Jeff Silbard (Wind beneath my Wings) en Russ Ballard.In februari 2010 komt de eerste single van dit album "Panic Attack" binnen in de single top 100 waarna deze doorstijgt en hoog in de charts komt. Een tweede stuk "All fired Up" wordt tegelijkertijd door het TT Circuit Assen gekozen tot de seizoenstune. Op 3 april trad Heerink tijdens de 5e uitreiking van de Eddie Christiani Award\, die hijzelf opnieuw presenteerde\,op met Steve Lukather\, (gitarist/zanger van Toto) de winnaar van deze editie.

Era el verano claro está\, y yo empezaba a soñar con mi pasado. Ante un espejo le fingí que maquillaba mi nariz para mirarle. Cuando me vi tan cerca de él había dado no sé qué por conquistarle.  Me sonrió con intención y fue su edad la explicación de su victoria. No quiso hablarme del amor\, pues según él esa cuestión es otra historia. Me dijo tú me vas muy bien\, eres igual que la mujer de "El Graduado". Yo no pude resistir y entre sus brazos descubrí\, un sol dorado.  Dieciocho años nada más eso le hizo ser audaz mas que insolente. Cuando llegué a despertar\, solo sentí la soledad indiferente. Por un momento pretendí el retenerlo junto a mí\, pero no quise. Me dijo no has estado mal\, con un candor tan infernal\, antes de irse. Entonces tuve que fingir que maquillaba mi nariz\, para no verle y estuve a punto de olvidar que yo le doblaba la edad.

COL title VAL Darkness\, Darkness COL performer VAL The Youngbloods	COL video title VAL Björn Afzelius - Tusen Bitar COL description VAL Musikvideo till Björn Afzelius "Tusen Bitar" - en av hans mest kända och älskade låtar.   Originalversionen\, "Tusind Stykker"\, skrevs av den danska sångerskan Anne Linnet.  Videon är tagen från VHS-versionen av Afzelius-dokumentären "Sjung ingen lovsång" från 1999. I musikvideon medverkar bland andra Sven Wollter\, Lasse Brandeby och Tomas von Brömssen.   Stereo: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u-ZcFgDj-4&fmt=18  Text: Det sägs att ovan molnen är himlen alltid blå\,  Men det kan va svårt att tro när man inte ser den.  Och det sägs att efter regnet kommer solen fram igen\,  men det hjälper sällan dom som har blitt våta.  För när vännerna försvinner\, eller kärleken tar slut\,  ser man allt med lite andra ögon.  Man övar sig\, och långsamt blir man bättre på att se  skillnad mellan sanningar och lögner.   Allting kan gå itu\, men ett hjärta kan gå i tusen bitar;  Säger du att du är min vän så är du kanske det.   Det sägs att det finns alltid nånting bra i det som sker\,  och tron är ofta den som ger oss styrka.  Ja\, man säger mycket\, men man vet så lite om sig själv  när ångesten och ensamheten kommer.   För när vännerna försvinner\, eller kärleken tar slut\,  ser man allt med lite andra ögon.  Man övar sig\, och långsamt blir man bättre på att se  skillnad mellan sanningar och lögner.   Allting kan gå itu\, men ett hjärta kan gå i tusen bitar;  Säger du att du är min vän så är du säkert det. COL channel name VAL mrsteehle	0

Talk about a lead singer being camera shy - you only saw his face maybe 5 or 6 times during the performance. Most of the time his back was to the audience.

'Classic Folk Music from Smithsonian Folkways Recordings' is available on CD and digital.  Stream/download/purchase: Smithsonian Folkways: https://folkways.si.edu/classic-folk-music-from-folkways-recordings/american-folk/music/album/smithsonian Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/album/3ZvJN4KO7r0ivacGwObKVt?si=XdZ6zndVS6SR_0xDGyfUag  We often take for granted the supremacy of artists such as Doc Watson\, Woody Guthrie\, Pete Seeger\, Lead Belly\, Big Bill Broonzy\, Brownie McGhee\, and other folk music legends. Classic Folk sheds new light on the success of the urban intellectual-driven movement that made rural white and African-American artists and their music favorites of audiences everywhere. This recording features classic performances by classic artists doing some of their classic songs during the great folksong revival of the 1940s through 1960s. It features some of the great performances from the vaults of Folkways Records. Compiled and annotated by Jeff Place.

Was the singer for several different bands in the 1920s\, including the Colonial Club Orchestra and The Regents Club Orchestra. He disappeared from public view in 1934 when he was laid off from work in the record industry as an executive and then genuinely disappeared for good\, because no one knows what happened to him after that. This was one of his biggest hits\, charting at #25 in 1930 for the year. Also a big(ger) hit for Nat Skrillet in the same year.  Photo is of the Regents Club Dance Hall In Brighton\, England. It was converted to a bingo hall in 1967 and then bulldozed in 1974\, a victim of changing taste in dance music.  50 hits on 9/26/11 100 hits on 11/10/11 250 hits on 3/16/12 500 htis on 9/6/12 COL channel name VAL MusicProjectX	0

She grew up with her parents and three siblings\, where it was her father who introduced her to the music when she was 10 years old. He was a musician himself. When she was 14\, her great love and Suzi Quatro became her great role model. The school's orchestra became her first gambling arena.  As an 18-year-old girl\, she began to sing and play professionally with a Bulgarian band. where they played around at the Black Sea tourist spots. She eventually got a lot of experience and got a job in a variety show.  Russia became the next venue. She also got to play for the Bulgarian president twice. In 1991 she came to Norway for the first time with "Smile Band". They played together for 15 years\, all over Norway and Europe. They had many great experiences together\, as when in 2001 she was singing and playing with one of her favorites\, Bonnie Taylor. She gave her a compliment\, which she will forever remember; “You sound more like me than I do”!   In 2003\, "Smile Band" broke up\, and Valentina started playing around as a troubadour. At Oset 2006\, she had the pleasure of meeting Bobby Bare. He invited her up on the stage and they sang and played together. It was a dream to stand in front of so many people singing. She also met Pam Tillis and Paul Young and the joy was also great when she got to play and sing along with Lynn Anderson In 2007 she released her first CD "Why not me". It sold over 16\,000 copies and the first gold plate was hung on the wall.  Now the second CD is finished\, "Comin` down the road"\, where Valentina is even stronger in her genre country-pop-rock. She has also included Stephen Ackles on a duet\, "To a tear becomes a rose"  #Valentina #QueenOfHearts# #CountryClassic #RonjasCountryMusic #RonjaGM COL channel name VAL RonjaGM	1

It was recorded by Joan Baez (credited as "traditional") and released on her 1962 album Joan Baez in Concert\, Part 1\, and also by the English rock band Led Zeppelin\, who included it on their 1969 debut album Led Zeppelin.  Other interpretations of the Bredon song include versions by: The Plebs (1964 Decca Records UK/MGM Records USA)\, The Association in 1965 (also doing a live version in 1970) and British pop singer Mark Wynter in 1965.  Quicksilver Messenger Service recorded a variation on the song in 1967.  Welsh band Man would later cover the QMS song on their 1976 album Maximum Darkness (recorded live at Roundhouse\, Chalk Farm on 26 May 1975).  Joan Baez version  Whilst a student at UC-Berkeley in around 1960\, Anne Bredon appeared on a live folk-music radio show The Midnight Special on radio station KPFA\, on which she sang "Babe\, I'm Gonna Leave You". A fellow folk singer who guested on The Midnight Special\, Janet Smith\, took up the song and developed it further\, playing it live at hootenanny folk-song events at Oberlin College\, one performance of which was attended by Joan Baez.  Baez requested Smith to send her a recording of her songs\, including "Babe\, I'm Gonna Leave You"\, which Baez subsequently began performing herself. It became the opening track on Joan Baez in Concert\, Part 1.  Initially\, the song had no writers' credit\, but after Smith contacted Bredon\, who confirmed her authorship\, later pressings of ...In Concert gave the writing credit to Bredon.  Led Zeppelin version  The band covered Baez's version: both guitarist Jimmy Page and singer Robert Plant were fans of Baez. Baez's album had originally indicated no writing credit\, and Led Zeppelin credited the song as "Trad. arr. Page". In the 1980s Bredon was made aware of Led Zeppelin's version of the song and since 1990 the Led Zeppelin version has been credited to Anne Bredon/Jimmy Page & Robert Plant: Bredon received a substantial back-payment of royalties.  Page played the song to Plant at their first meeting together\, at Page's riverside home at Pangbourne in late July 1968. It is sometimes stated that the arrangement evolved when Plant played Page the guitar part that eventually appeared on the album but\, in an interview he gave with Guitar World magazine in 1998\, Page denied this\, noting that he had worked out the arrangement long before he met Plant\, had told him he would like it on the album\, and that Plant at that time did not play the guitar.  It is rumored that Page recorded another version of the song\, with Steve Winwood in 1968\, that was never released. The band played this song at Led Zeppelin concerts on its 1969 concert tours\, then Page and Plant brought it back in a 9-minute version for their 1998 reunion. A live\, filmed performance of "Babe I'm Gonna Leave You"\, from Led Zeppelin's gig on Danmarks Radio at Gladsaxe\, Denmark\, on March 17\, 1969\, is featured on the Led Zeppelin DVD (2003).  At the 1:41 mark of Led Zeppelin's version of "Babe I'm Gonna Leave You"\, it is possible to hear Plant singing\, "I can hear it calling me" just before he sings the same line in full volume: bleed from Plant's scratch vocal appears on the drum tracks\, which were recorded with the full band.  Record producer Rick Rubin has remarked\, "It ["Babe I'm Gonna Leave You"] is a song with a classical nature that also really rocks. It really takes you on a trip." The song is featured on the 2006 One Tree Hill episode entitled "The Show Must Go On".  As a result of touring in the United States and watching various "Led Zeppelin" cover bands and other artists perform this song Robert Plant performed the song with his band "Strange Sensations" and as a solo artist.  Although a cover itself\, numerous artists have covered the Led Zeppelin version of the song\, crediting Page/Plant/Bredon..  1971: Pyg (Free with PYG [recorded live 1971]) 1996: Great White (Stage) 2000: Paul Oakenfold (Perfecto Presents: Another World [remix by Quivver]) 2002: Cactus Jack (DisCover) 2002: Doro (The Music Remains the Same: A Tribute to Led Zeppelin) 2005: Hal Lindes (Get the Lead Out) 2007: Vanilla Fudge (Out Through the In Door) 2007: Carl Kennedy with Dirty South (Onelove: Your Disco Will Eat You [remix]) 2008: Tony Franklin (Rock N' Pop Ballads) 2008: Joe Lynn Turner (Led Box: The Ultimate Led Zeppelin Tribute) 2009: P!nk (As part of her Funhouse Tour) 2011: Overload (As part of Overload Live at the Apartment Sessions) 2011: Dorians (Live in Erevan) COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

Her first song was "Please Don't Talk To The Lifeguard" and the song was continuously played on the radio with moderate success. There was a popular radio station 'WGAS" in Gastonia\, NC that played her album songs every hour on the hour to promote "The Exciting Years" and most of us had her album also.

Dette er en sang som jeg liker veldig godt og som betyr veldig mye for meg. ___________________________________  Ja fysst så vil je nevne min stilling og min stæinn\, je står og svarver hatter i Salomo sitt læinn. Sjøl bær je navnet Jørgen\, så skilnaden er stor\, men både je og Salomo kom nakne tel vår jord.  Refr.:  Sola skin på deg så skuggen fell på meg men graset er grønt for æille.  Når liljene på marken i fager blomstring står\, og alle himlens fugler sin glade trille slår\, je nynne såmmå strofa i hattemakergrenn\, og morgendagen\, Salomo\, hva vet vel vi om den?  Refr.  Har Salomo sitt måltid med vin og fylte fat\, je sug på harde skorper og kæille det for mat\, men det vi gir ifrå øss di vi i lønndom går blir gras til hyrdens hvite lam og Sarons sorte får.  Refr.  Når dronningen av Saba gjør Salomo visitt\, je ser a "Lea Lettvint" og hu har tenkt seg hit. Om leiet blir forskjellig frå silkeseng tel strå\, vi går mot såmmå paradis og hører harper slå.  Refr.  Når sola synk og dale bak slottets tårn og tind\, så kjæm den mørke natta med drøm og tankespinn\, der blir je sjøl Kong Salomo og hæin blir kænskje den som står og svarver hatter uti hattemakergrenn.

She grew up with her parents and three siblings\, where it was her father who introduced her to the music when she was 10 years old. He was a musician himself. When she was 14\, her great love and Suzi Quatro became her great role model. The school's orchestra became her first gambling arena.  As an 18-year-old girl\, she began to sing and play professionally with a Bulgarian band. where they played around at the Black Sea tourist spots. She eventually got a lot of experience and got a job in a variety show.  Russia became the next venue. She also got to play for the Bulgarian president twice. In 1991 she came to Norway for the first time with "Smile Band". They played together for 15 years\, all over Norway and Europe. They had many great experiences together\, as when in 2001 she was singing and playing with one of her favorites\, Bonnie Taylor. She gave her a compliment\, which she will forever remember; “You sound more like me than I do”!   In 2003\, "Smile Band" broke up\, and Valentina started playing around as a troubadour. At Oset 2006\, she had the pleasure of meeting Bobby Bare. He invited her up on the stage and they sang and played together. It was a dream to stand in front of so many people singing. She also met Pam Tillis and Paul Young and the joy was also great when she got to play and sing along with Lynn Anderson In 2007 she released her first CD "Why not me". It sold over 16\,000 copies and the first gold plate was hung on the wall.  Now the second CD is finished\, "Comin` down the road"\, where Valentina is even stronger in her genre country-pop-rock. She has also included Stephen Ackles on a duet\, "To a tear becomes a rose"  #Valentina #QueenOfHearts# #CountryClassic #RonjasCountryMusic #RonjaGM COL channel name VAL RonjaGM	0

COL title VAL Jim Webb Collage COL performer VAL The Mystic Moods Orchestra	COL video title VAL ELLIE POP - WHATCHA GONNA DO ABOUT IT.wmv COL description VAL ELLIE POP - 'Watcha Gonna Do 'Bout It' (Mainstream S-6115) 1968  Before I started collecting original 60s garage/psych 45s I spent decades buying (mostly) original and re-issue albums and one of my early purchases was this obscurity by Ellie Pop on Mainstream Records. This album is hard to find and commands a decent price tag but it was re-issued a few years ago and should now be available to a larger audience at last.  In my opinion Ellie Pop were treading their own path in 1968\, there's no fuzz\, no psych touches\, no 1968isms of heavy guitars and keyboards. What you get is a collection of beautifully constructed pop songs that suggest a big Anglophile influence\, in particular mid-60s period Beatles. They sound similar to say The Merry-Go-Round or The Left Banke but without the baroque touches. Just pure pop\, or should I say Ellie Pop.  Virtually every review I've read online or in Shindig for instance\, fails to mention that 'Whatcha Gonna Do 'Bout It' is a cover of a Hollies cut they recorded in 1963 for their debut album 'Stay With The Hollies.' Ellie Pop wrote all of their own tunes except this one!  I'm not certain where Ellie Pop hailed from or even the full names of the group members but it has been suggested elsewhere that they were from Detroit. Maybe someone can confirm this?  http://expo67-cavestones.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/ellie-pop-whatcha-gonna-do-bout-it.html COL channel name VAL ACID REVOLVER	0

Happy Happy Birthday Baby is one of my favorite songs by Diane. I met her in 1963 when I was 12 years old in Downtown Gastonia. I was very impressed by her and she gave Gastonia a lot of recognition at the time of her record release. Her first song was "Please Don't Talk To The Lifeguard" and the song was continuously played on the radio with moderate success. There was a popular radio station 'WGAS" in Gastonia\, NC that played her album songs every hour on the hour to promote "The Exciting Years" and most of us had her album also. Hope you enjoy the song and slideshow. COL channel name VAL David Carpenter	0

Inez sang lead vocal\, while Charlie sang back-up and played guitar.[1]   Their most successful record was with their novelty composition\, "Mockingbird". Released in 1963\, it made the Top 10 on both the rhythm and blues and pop charts; the song was later covered by artists including Aretha Franklin\, James Taylor\, Carly Simon\, Dusty Springfield and Toby Keith. Other notable recordings were "Hurt by Love\," "Ask Me\," and "(1-2-3-4-5-6-7) Count the Days."   They were known for their exciting live performances\, of which a highlight was Inez's rendition of "I Stand Accused"\, which finished with a supposedly distraught Inez singing the last verse\, while being carried offstage by Charlie. They toured extensively in Europe and their music played a key role in the development of the Northern Soul movement.   Inez also had some success recording on her own\, beginning in 1969\, but her popularity faded in the 1970s. Charlie was already working as a record producer when they finally disbanded their act.   Inez Foxx was married to the American songwriter and producer Luther Dixon. Together they wrote\, and he produced\, The Platters' mid-1960s return to hit-making with the single "I Love You 1000 Times".[2] Luther Dixon produced Inez and Charlie's 1967 album Come By Here\, but the couple later divorced.[2]   Charlie Foxx died from leukemia in 1998\, at the age of 58.

COL title VAL Drop down Mama COL performer VAL Bearfoot [1]	COL video title VAL The Coal Porters - Another Girl\, Another Planet (live) COL description VAL The Coal Porters play Another Girl Another Planet live in Wales\, 2014.  Another Girl Another Planet is featured on The Coal Porters new album\, No. 6. No. 6\, is produced by John Wood\, the legendary British folk-rock mastermind who recorded the classic albums of Fairport Convention\, Nick Drake\, Beth Orton and Squeeze. No. 6 is a bit of a departure for the Coal Porters as it pushes their musical boundaries further than ever before.The Coal Porters - No. 6  https://thecoalporters.com / https://thecoalporters.bandcamp.com / https://www.facebook.com/thecoalporters  This new album features Kerenza quadruple tracking herself into a string quartet\, Andrew on a ukulele\, Sid on trusty autoharp and mandolin\, both Neil and Paul on dobro\, a Byrdsy acoustic 12-string guitar\, and very emotional\, long\, sweet trumpet solo by Cuba’s noted “son y mambo” music virtuoso Eikel Venegas. There has never been music like this before. And already\, the album’s opening track\, Sid’s “The Day The Last Ramone Died\,” is being hailed as a classic.  Recorded in two creative bursts in late 2014 and in 2015 this is the Coal Porters album which took three years to incubate. Four new Sid songs\, three new Neil Bob Herd originals\, and Kerenza Peacock contributed her first recorded lead vocal on a very personal song with Play A Tune while also gracing the record with a totally catchy instrumental\, Chopping The Garlic. The album goes out on a high note with the band’s warm-hearted cover of the Only Ones’ classic hit Another Girl\, Another Planet.  No.6 was released in September 2016 and can be ordered via Amazon\, iTunes\, the Sid Griffin website and in all good records stores.

Fools Fall In Love  ------------------------  "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" is a song by American punk rock band Green Day. It was released as the second single from their seventh album\, American Idiot. The song was written by Green Day\, with lyrics by lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong. The single peaked at number two in the United States\, making it Green Day's most successful song.  Influences and covers  Noel Gallagher of Oasis criticized Green Day in late 2006\, saying\, "They should have the decency to wait until I am dead [before stealing my songs]. I\, at least\, pay the people I steal from that courtesy"\, referencing the fact that "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" uses the same chord progression as Oasis's hit single "Wonderwall". Gallagher's reaction may have partly been due to the emergence of "Boulevard of Broken Songs"\, a popular mash-up mixed by San Francisco DJ and producer Party Ben in late 2004. The mix consisted of elements from "Boulevard of Broken Dreams"\, "Wonderwall"\, Travis' "Writing to Reach You" and Eminem's "Sing for the Moment"\, which itself has samples from Aerosmith's "Dream On" (another remix by Party Ben featured this\, "Wonderwall" and Kanye West's "Flashing Lights"). This song was covered by Japanese-American singer Hikaru Utada acoustically with a guitar during an internet broadcast in December 2005; a video of it can be found. "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" is sung first and then fades into "Passion" (After the Battle version) from the Kingdom Hearts II original soundtrack. "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" is also featured in the movie trailer of Lords of Dogtown (2005)\, starring Heath Ledger\, Emile Hirsch and John Robinson. Billie Joe Armstrong wrote the song while he was in his son Joey's bedroom.[citation needed] In the 2005 VH1 Storytellers program featuring Green Day\, Billie Joe Armstrong stated that the title of the song was "nicked" from the famous Gottfried Helnwein painting of the same title\, which features James Dean. Four earlier songs also have the same title: an old Harry Warren song\, a Hanoi Rocks song\, a Marianne Faithfull song\, and song by Brian Setzer from his 1986 album The Knife Feels Like Justice Lyrics from the song bear some resemblance to the Pinhead Gunpowder song "I Walk Alone"\, a band in which Billie Joe Armstrong also sings. It appeared on their 1997 album\, Goodbye Ellston Avenue. The song also shares some lyrics with the Whitesnake song "Here I Go Again"\, the words "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" can be found in the lyrics of the Elvis Costello song "Brilliant Mistake"\, the Allman Brothers Band song "End of the Line"\, the Deadsy song "The Key to Gramercy Park"\, and The Ataris song "Road Signs and Rock Songs". The phrase "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" also appears in punk/new wave band Blondie's 1982 minor UK-hit single Island of Lost Souls. A live version of the song can be found on Bullet in a Bible\, a live album of Green Day performing at the Milton Keynes National Bowl. Bluegrass band Cornbread Red did a cover of the song on a tribute album to Green Day Pickin' on Green Day\, while the German choir Gregorian did a cover\, on their Masters of Chant Chapter V album\, in the style of a Gregorian Chant. Mark Mallman covered this song on his MP3-only compilation release Outtakes Vol 1. The song is also featured in Green Day's musical American Idiot\, sung on the cast recording by John Gallagher Jr.\, Rebecca Naomi Jones\, and the rest of the company.

The song became a number 1 in the States for Margaret Whiting in 1948 staying on the chart for 23 weeks. This version by Marty comes from his 1977 album 'Don't Let Me Touch You.' Other singers to have recorded the song include Al Jolson\, Frank Sinatra and Connie Francis. Regarding Reid's songs 'The Gypsy' and 'A Tree In The Meadow'\, it's a pity that songs like this don't seem to get written nowadays.

COL title VAL I Can't Stand It COL performer VAL The House of Love	COL video title VAL Rudy A Message To You - The Locomotive (1967) COL description VAL Locomotive formed in Birmingham\, England originally as a jazz band and by the mid 60s they were taking great influence from early ska music brought to the city by Jamaicans who were finding work in the industrial heartland of Britain.   Although there were other white musicians dabbling in Jamaican Ska in the early 60s\, Locomotive were possibly the earliest British band to experiment with Ska in an authentic way\, and as a white 'band' were probably quite ahead of their time considering they made it to vinyl.    While Brumbeat bands and artists such as 'Spencer Davis Group'\, 'The Move' and 'Robert Plant' were mimicking the blues of black America\, Locomotive were looking more to the West Indies for their inspiration\, which\, today\, could be considered a short-cut to a cooler sound than black American blues\, which by this time had taken a step in a completely different direction "heavy metal".  Locomotive's later styles included Soul\, Psychedelia and a fade into the prog rock era with Norman Haines eventually going it alone.  This is the first cover of Dandy Livingstone's "Rudy A Message To You"\, recorded in the same year as the original in late 1967 and is B-Side to "Broken Heart" on the Direction label. It was recorded over a decade before the seminal Specials version.   There were several notable band members such as Chris Wood who went on to join supergroup 'Traffic'\,  Mike Kellie of 'Spooky Tooth' and Bob Lamb who was the producer for 70s dub reggae band 'UB40'.

Fools Fall In Love  ------------------------  "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" is a song by American punk rock band Green Day. It was released as the second single from their seventh album\, American Idiot. The song was written by Green Day\, with lyrics by lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong. The single peaked at number two in the United States\, making it Green Day's most successful song.  Influences and covers  Noel Gallagher of Oasis criticized Green Day in late 2006\, saying\, "They should have the decency to wait until I am dead [before stealing my songs]. I\, at least\, pay the people I steal from that courtesy"\, referencing the fact that "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" uses the same chord progression as Oasis's hit single "Wonderwall". Gallagher's reaction may have partly been due to the emergence of "Boulevard of Broken Songs"\, a popular mash-up mixed by San Francisco DJ and producer Party Ben in late 2004. The mix consisted of elements from "Boulevard of Broken Dreams"\, "Wonderwall"\, Travis' "Writing to Reach You" and Eminem's "Sing for the Moment"\, which itself has samples from Aerosmith's "Dream On" (another remix by Party Ben featured this\, "Wonderwall" and Kanye West's "Flashing Lights"). This song was covered by Japanese-American singer Hikaru Utada acoustically with a guitar during an internet broadcast in December 2005; a video of it can be found. "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" is sung first and then fades into "Passion" (After the Battle version) from the Kingdom Hearts II original soundtrack. "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" is also featured in the movie trailer of Lords of Dogtown (2005)\, starring Heath Ledger\, Emile Hirsch and John Robinson. Billie Joe Armstrong wrote the song while he was in his son Joey's bedroom.[citation needed] In the 2005 VH1 Storytellers program featuring Green Day\, Billie Joe Armstrong stated that the title of the song was "nicked" from the famous Gottfried Helnwein painting of the same title\, which features James Dean. Four earlier songs also have the same title: an old Harry Warren song\, a Hanoi Rocks song\, a Marianne Faithfull song\, and song by Brian Setzer from his 1986 album The Knife Feels Like Justice Lyrics from the song bear some resemblance to the Pinhead Gunpowder song "I Walk Alone"\, a band in which Billie Joe Armstrong also sings. It appeared on their 1997 album\, Goodbye Ellston Avenue. The song also shares some lyrics with the Whitesnake song "Here I Go Again"\, the words "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" can be found in the lyrics of the Elvis Costello song "Brilliant Mistake"\, the Allman Brothers Band song "End of the Line"\, the Deadsy song "The Key to Gramercy Park"\, and The Ataris song "Road Signs and Rock Songs". The phrase "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" also appears in punk/new wave band Blondie's 1982 minor UK-hit single Island of Lost Souls. A live version of the song can be found on Bullet in a Bible\, a live album of Green Day performing at the Milton Keynes National Bowl. Bluegrass band Cornbread Red did a cover of the song on a tribute album to Green Day Pickin' on Green Day\, while the German choir Gregorian did a cover\, on their Masters of Chant Chapter V album\, in the style of a Gregorian Chant. Mark Mallman covered this song on his MP3-only compilation release Outtakes Vol 1. The song is also featured in Green Day's musical American Idiot\, sung on the cast recording by John Gallagher Jr.\, Rebecca Naomi Jones\, and the rest of the company.

Que j'me démène ou qu'je reste coi Je passe pour un je-ne-sais-quoi  Je ne fais pourtant de tort à  personne En suivant mon chemin de petit bonhomme. Mais les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Non les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Tout le monde médit de moi\, Sauf les muets\, ça va de soi.  Le jour du Quatorze Juillet Je reste dans mon lit douillet. La musique qui marche au pas\, Cela ne me regarde pas.  Je ne fais pourtant de tort à  personne\, En n'écoutant pas le clairon qui sonne. Mais les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Non les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Tout le monde me montre du doigt Sauf les manchots\, ça va de soi.  Quand j'croise un voleur malchanceux\, Poursuivi par un cul-terreux; J'lance la patte et pourquoi le taire\, Le cul-terreux s'retrouve par terre  Je ne fais pourtant de tort à  personne\, En laissant courir les voleurs de pommes. Mais les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Non les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Tout le monde se rue sur moi\, Sauf les culs-de-jatte\, ça va de soi.  Pas besoin d'être Jérémie\, Pour d'viner l'sort qui m'est promis\, S'ils trouvent une corde à  leur goût\, Ils me la passeront au cou\,  Je ne fais pourtant de tort à  personne\, En suivant les ch'mins qui n'mènent pas à  Rome\, Mais les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Non les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Tout l'mond' viendra me voir pendu\, Sauf les aveugles\, bien entendu.

COL title VAL Arrivederci COL performer VAL Nicola Arigliano	COL video title VAL Arrivederci - Mario Musella COL description VAL Il video della versione radio edit di "Arrivederci"\, il brano che dà il titolo all'album inedito di Mario Musella pubblicato da Suonidelsud.su licenza KING UNIVERSAL "Arriverderci" contiene otto registrazioni realizzate nel 1975 quando Mario Musella aveva già lasciato gli Showmen intraprendendo la carriera solistica. Otto canzoni\, in gran parte cover\, in cui la voce del "nero a metà" della musica napoletana si rivela in tutta la sua carismatica espressività. Un album sospeso tra rhythm'n'blues\, rock'n'roll e tanto soul in cui spicca la presenza di alcuni "turnisti" d'eccezione che rispondono ai nomi di Pino Daniele e Enzo Avitabile. Di grande intensità le riletture di "Arrivederci"\, il capolavoro di Umberto Bindi che dà giustamente il titolo al disco; assolutamente trascinante l'interpretazione di "True fine mama" di Little Richards ; decisamente eleganti le rarefatte atmosfere della celeberrima "Giorgia on my mind" di Ray Charles" e di "Entriamo nel gioco"\, versione italiana di quella "You make me feel a brand new" portata al successo dai Simply Red" vent'anni dopo.  Ancor prima di essere un eccezionale documento storico\, "Arriverdeci" è un album che testimonia alla perfezione la grandezza di un interprete come non ce ne sono stati più.

COL title VAL Gigantic COL performer VAL Ladies Who Lunch	COL video title VAL A.R. Scammell The Squid Jiggin' Ground Part 1 (with lyrics) COL description VAL Oh\, this is the place where the fishermen gather\,  With oilskins and boots and Cape Anns battened down;  All sizes of figures with squid lines and jiggers\,  They congregate here on the squid-jigging ground.   Some are workin' their jiggers while others are yarnin'\,  There's some standin' up and there's more lyin' down;  While all kinds of fun\, jokes and tricks are begun  As they wait for the squid on the squid-jiggin' ground.   There's men of all ages and boys in the bargain;  There's old Billy Cave and there's young Raymond Brown\,  There's a red rantin' Tory out here in a dory\,  A-runnin' down Squires on the squid-jiggin' ground.   There's men from the Harbour and men from the Tickle\,  In all kinds of motorboats\, green\, grey and brown;  Right yonder is Bobby and with him is Nobby\,  He's chawin' hard tack on the squid-jiggin' ground.   God bless my sou'wester\, there's Skipper John Chaffey\,  He's the best hand at squid-jiggin' here\, I'll be bound.  Hello! What's the row? Why he's jiggin' one now\,  The very first squid on the squid-jiggin' ground.   The man with the whiskers is old Jacob Steele;  He's gettin well up but he's still pretty sound.  While Uncle Bob Hawkins wears six pair o' stockin's  Whenever he's out on the squid-jiggin' ground.   Holy smoke! What a scuffle! All hands are excited.  'Tis a wonder to me that there's nobody drowned.  There's confusion\, a bustle\, a wonderful hustle\,  They're all jiggin' squids on the squid-jiggin' ground.   Says Bobby\, "The squids are on top of the water\,  I just got me jigger 'bout one fathom down" ---  When a squid in the boat squirted right down his throat\,  And he's swearin' like mad on the squid-jiggin' ground.   There's poor Uncle Billy\, his whiskers are spattered  With spots of the squid juice that's flying around;  One poor little b'y got it right in the eye\,  But they don't give a damn on the squid-jiggin' ground.   Now if ever you feel inclined to go squiddin'\,  Leave your white shirts and collars behind in the town.  And if you get cranky without your silk hanky  You'd better steer clear of the squid-jiggin' ground.   Found in a used record store dollar bin in Sydney\, Cape Breton\, NS\, 2002. Record released in 1942\, or thenabouts.

I've only added the footage as a tribute for historical\, entertainment\, and creative purposes with no financial gain. Copyright infringement not intended.  The Four Tunes "I Sold My Heart To The Junkman" Jubilee 5174 A 1954  Here are The Four Tunes with their version of "I Sold My Heart To The Junkman." This is the 2nd pressing that was released in 1954 by Jubilee\, in the same year as the 1st pressing. A nice\, minty\, clean 78 for your enjoyment.  The 4 Tunes were probably the leading black Pop vocal group during the 1950s. Their origins can be traced back to a change of personnel in the Ink Spots. This requires a brief review of some events in the mid-40s. In June 1944\, during an engagement in Chicago\, Hoppy Jones became ill and the group had to finish a tour without him (Deek Watson filled in on the mandatory talking parts). This had unsuspected ramifications. Hoppy was the conciliatory father figure (nicknamed "the grand old man") of the Ink Spots. Now that he was missing\, infighting between Bill Kenny and Deek Watson\, which had formerly just smoldered\, now flared up unchecked. Deek had been the leader of the group until their 1939 smash of "If I Didn't Care." Since then\, Bill had firmly established himself in the forefront of the Ink Spots\, pushing Deek further and further into the background. Hoppy returned in August\, but by then\, the damage had been done.  When he announced (in the January 1945 settlement of the lawsuits) that he would form a new group based "on a completely new idea\," he simply changed their name to the "Brown Dots" (the name does sound somewhat familiar\, doesn't it?). As it turned out\, the "new idea" was to sound as much like the Ink Spots as possible. One real difference was that the Brown Dots relied more on harmony than the Ink Spots\, who were more individualists. (Since the Brown Dots were also managed by Moe Gale\, we know who the hands-down winner in this contest was.)  The polished style of the 4 Tunes was the product of their training\, experience\, dedication\, and discipline. Their songs were carefully selected and arranged. Their first arranger was pianist Ralph Herman\, who was the youngest member of Paul Whiteman's Orchestra. They also worked with Howard Biggs (whose most famous association was with the Ravens).  In mid-1953\, they once again changed labels (since they weren't making any royalties from RCA). This time they went to Jerry Blaine's Jubilee label\, where they achieved their greatest popularity. Their first Jubilee recording\, "Marie\," was released in September\, and reached #2 on the R&B charts (#13 Pop). This Irving Berlin tune had been a #1 smash for Tommy Dorsey (Jack Leonard on vocal) back in 1937. ("Marie" was such a big hit that the purely R&B Dominoes and Larks were pushed to sing in the same kind of Pop mold.) Their next Jubilee release\, "I Understand Just How You Feel" was an even bigger hit\, climbing to #6 on the Pop charts (#7 R&B).  1954 saw two releases on the Kay-Ron label. These were old Manor cuts (although different takes). Two of them were backups to Savannah Churchill ("Savannah Sings The Blues" and "I Want To Be Loved"). The other two were "Just In Case You Change Your Mind" (which was actually by the Brown Dots) and "I Understand" (which was presumably released to confuse record buyers into thinking it was the same song as the current "I Understand Just How You Feel").  On Jubilee\, the 4 Tunes were primarily a Pop group (although they did turn out something called "Rock N Roll Call"). Their output included "Don't Cry Darling\," "L'amour\, Toujours L'amour\," "I Sold My Heart To The Junkman\," "Time Out For Tears\," "You Are My Love\," "Far Away Places\," "Dancing With Tears In My Eyes\," "Sayonara\," and "A Little On The Lonely Side."  The 4 Tunes appeared for a week at the Apollo Theater (beginning April 2\, 1955)\, along with Red Prysock's Orchestra. They played both the black theater circuit and also many white clubs. When they were on a tour with Joni James\, she asked Jimmie Nabbie to write a song for her. The result\, "You Are My Love\," was her big hit of 1955 (which the 4 Tunes covered).  In 1955\, the 4 Tunes were booked into the Hacienda in Las Vegas on a handshake\, and stayed for eight years. Other members\, added at the time\, were Smiley Hightower (guitar and bassist) and Eddie Williams (bassist; formerly of Johnny Moore's Three Blazers). Also\, tenor Billy Wells (from Deek's second Brown Dots group) was hired so that each of the other members could go on vacation on a rotating basis.

COL title VAL After the Fire Is Gone COL performer VAL Tracy Nelson & Willie Nelson	COL video title VAL 1913 Massacre Ramblin' Jack Elliott COL description VAL 1913 Massacre American Folk Tales Ramblin' Jack Elliot  The 1913 Massacre is based on an event that took place just as the song says in Calumet\, Michigan on December 24\, 1913. It is always known as the Italian Hall Disaster. The strike that led up to this was one of the longest\, most dangerous strikes that took place in Michigan. The song refers to copper country which is the upper peninsula of Michigan.  The miners were striking for better pay\, shortened work days and safer working conditions. Worker's pay was based on the depth of penetration into the mines made by his group that day. The mine was switching to using a one man drill\, the mechanical drill cutting cost for the mines. However it broke up the family groups that worked in the mines together and cut many jobs. Most workers made around $2.75 a day for 10 - 12 hours a day.   The strike had been going on for 5 months. The striking miners and their families had gathered at the Italian Hall for a Christmas party. It is thought that there were five hundred people at the party. The building had a steep staircase and the party was being held on the second floor. There was a fire escape\, however as was common at the time\, it was poorly marked\, poorly lit\, and could only be reached by climbing through the window. Someone yelled "fire" and in the panic that followed 73 people were killed. Over half of the people killed were children between the ages of six and ten.  The investigations that followed produced no culprit. Part of the problem was victims who did not speak English were questioned and forced to answer in English. In other cases witnesses were not questioned at all. It was and still is commonly thought that out of town strike breakers\, funded by mine management\, were the ones that yelled fire.  The Italian Hall has since been demolished\, and only the archway remains from that day. A state historical markers marks the spot and date. COL channel name VAL leanannsidhe	0

COL title VAL I Wonder How the Old Folks Are at Home COL performer VAL Mac Wiseman	COL video title VAL Bill Keith Homestead on The Farm COL description VAL William Bradford Keith was born in Boston\, Massachusetts. He attended Amherst College and graduated in 1961. In 1963 he became a member of Bill Monroe's Bluegrass Boys.   Keith's recordings and performances during these nine months with Monroe permanently altered banjo playing\, and his style has become an important part of the playing styles of many banjoists. After leaving the Bluegrass Boys\, he joined "Jim Kweskin Jug Band" playing plectrum banjo. He began playing the steel guitar and soon after 1968\, found himself working together with Ian and Sylvia and Jonathan Edwards. In the 1970s Keith recorded for Rounder Records. Over the years he has performed with several other musicians\, such as Clarence White and David Grisman in Muleskinner\, Tony Trischka\, Jim Rooney and Jim Collier. Today\, Keith style is still regarded as modern or progressive in the context of bluegrass banjo playing.    Keith made a mechanical contribution to the banjo\, as well. He designed a specialized type of banjo tuning peg that facilitates changing quickly from one open tuning to another\, while playing. Earlier famed banjoist Earl Scruggs had designed a set of cams which were added to the banjo to perform this task. Keith's invention made the extra hardware unnecessary\, replacing two of the tuning machines already on the banjo — a more elegant solution. Scruggs himself became a partner in the venture for a while\, and the product was known as "Scruggs-Keith Pegs". Known today simply as Keith Pegs\, they remain the state of the art\, and Bill Keith continues to manufacture and market them personally as the primary product of his own company\, the Beacon Banjo Company.

Era el verano claro está\, y yo empezaba a soñar con mi pasado. Ante un espejo le fingí que maquillaba mi nariz para mirarle. Cuando me vi tan cerca de él había dado no sé qué por conquistarle.  Me sonrió con intención y fue su edad la explicación de su victoria. No quiso hablarme del amor\, pues según él esa cuestión es otra historia. Me dijo tú me vas muy bien\, eres igual que la mujer de "El Graduado". Yo no pude resistir y entre sus brazos descubrí\, un sol dorado.  Dieciocho años nada más eso le hizo ser audaz mas que insolente. Cuando llegué a despertar\, solo sentí la soledad indiferente. Por un momento pretendí el retenerlo junto a mí\, pero no quise. Me dijo no has estado mal\, con un candor tan infernal\, antes de irse. Entonces tuve que fingir que maquillaba mi nariz\, para no verle y estuve a punto de olvidar que yo le doblaba la edad.

'Classic Folk Music from Smithsonian Folkways Recordings' is available on CD and digital.  Stream/download/purchase: Smithsonian Folkways: https://folkways.si.edu/classic-folk-music-from-folkways-recordings/american-folk/music/album/smithsonian Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/album/3ZvJN4KO7r0ivacGwObKVt?si=XdZ6zndVS6SR_0xDGyfUag  We often take for granted the supremacy of artists such as Doc Watson\, Woody Guthrie\, Pete Seeger\, Lead Belly\, Big Bill Broonzy\, Brownie McGhee\, and other folk music legends. Classic Folk sheds new light on the success of the urban intellectual-driven movement that made rural white and African-American artists and their music favorites of audiences everywhere. This recording features classic performances by classic artists doing some of their classic songs during the great folksong revival of the 1940s through 1960s. It features some of the great performances from the vaults of Folkways Records. Compiled and annotated by Jeff Place.

COL title VAL My Kind of Girl COL performer VAL Adam Faith	COL video title VAL The Mar-Keys - Last Night COL description VAL The Mar-Keys\, formed in 1958\, were an American studio session band for the Stax label from Memphis\, Tennessee\, in the 1960s. As the first house band for the label\, their backing music formed the foundation for the early 1960s Stax sound.  The group began as The Royal Spades and had tried unsuccessfully to get a record made for the local Satellite Records even though tenor sax player Charles "Packy" Axton's mother and uncle owned that label. When they were finally able to get a record made\, Axton's mother Estelle Axton convinced the group to change their name and they chose The Mar-Keys.  They also recorded organ and saxophone oriented singles of their own\, scoring a number three hit nationally with "Last Night" in 1961. It sold over one million copies\, earning gold disc recognition. Keyboards were played by Jerry Lee "Smoochy" Smith. Other singles of theirs from the early 1960s include "Philly Dog" and "Popeye Stroll." Members of this rhythm section later formed other nationally prominent Memphis studio session groups\, including the Memphis Horns\, the Packers\, and Booker T. & the M.G.'s. Each of these offshoot groups also recorded popular instrumental albums of their own\, in addition to serving as the backing band on albums by dozens of rock\, R&B\, and soul music stars on Stax\, Volt and other national labels. The legacy of the Mar-Keys and later groups was that of having been key players in the development of soul music styles like Southern soul and Memphis soul.

Superb early release on the Green Zonophone Label\, probably in the late 1920s\, with the serial no 5465 of this highly popular song. originally written by Woolsey And Sauer When Its Springtime In The Rockies.  I am not sure if it is the first release\, but certanly is ether early or late 1920s\, 30's or maybe before that.  Difficult to tell as one of my complaints about these old 78s is unlike their successors\, they never put the date of release on them. COL channel name VAL Sliepnir2006	0

Between 1921 and 1935 many musicians joined and left the California Ramblers including the famous Dorsey Brothers and the very eccentric\, Jack Purvis (trombone and trumpet)\, who is said to have trashed and burned hotel rooms\, flown as a soldier of fortune\, played 52nd St.\, scored music for full orchestra\, and eventually led a prison band. Other members included Adrian Rollini (bass sax and xylophone)\, Fud Livingston and Bobby Davis (saxophones)\, and Chelsea Quealey.     During the 1920s the band was so in demand that they purchased a hotel on Pelham Parkway in the Bronx where they lived\, practiced\, and performed\, and dubbed it the Ramblers Inn. They went on to play some of the greatest clubs in New York City including the Rainbow Room at the top of the Rockefeller Center.     The original recordings made here were all “acoustical” 78s and interestingly\, recorded prior to the introduction of the microphone in 1925.     Although the music has been all but lost in our modern society\, it is my hope that these remastered jewels plucked from of our early American traditions will now live on into the 21st century and beyond.

COL title VAL The Lambeth Walk COL performer VAL Dalida	COL video title VAL 1913 Massacre Ramblin' Jack Elliott COL description VAL 1913 Massacre American Folk Tales Ramblin' Jack Elliot  The 1913 Massacre is based on an event that took place just as the song says in Calumet\, Michigan on December 24\, 1913. It is always known as the Italian Hall Disaster. The strike that led up to this was one of the longest\, most dangerous strikes that took place in Michigan. The song refers to copper country which is the upper peninsula of Michigan.  The miners were striking for better pay\, shortened work days and safer working conditions. Worker's pay was based on the depth of penetration into the mines made by his group that day. The mine was switching to using a one man drill\, the mechanical drill cutting cost for the mines. However it broke up the family groups that worked in the mines together and cut many jobs. Most workers made around $2.75 a day for 10 - 12 hours a day.   The strike had been going on for 5 months. The striking miners and their families had gathered at the Italian Hall for a Christmas party. It is thought that there were five hundred people at the party. The building had a steep staircase and the party was being held on the second floor. There was a fire escape\, however as was common at the time\, it was poorly marked\, poorly lit\, and could only be reached by climbing through the window. Someone yelled "fire" and in the panic that followed 73 people were killed. Over half of the people killed were children between the ages of six and ten.  The investigations that followed produced no culprit. Part of the problem was victims who did not speak English were questioned and forced to answer in English. In other cases witnesses were not questioned at all. It was and still is commonly thought that out of town strike breakers\, funded by mine management\, were the ones that yelled fire.  The Italian Hall has since been demolished\, and only the archway remains from that day. A state historical markers marks the spot and date. COL channel name VAL leanannsidhe	0

A real "Jazz Oddity" - Federica Zammarchi "Jazz Oddity"\, consists in eleven re-arrangements of songs of David Bowie. Its concept came up a few years ago\, when she needed to mix together her two main musical loves\, namely jazz and 70's rock\, both so important during her forming years. It was recorded with an Italian all- star band and it showcases a uniquely innovative sound\, slightly influenced by european bands like the Esbjörn Svensson Trio\, coining a new genre definition called "PowerJazz".

In her three-decade long career as a solo artist\, Made in Brazil results from the first time she’s recorded a disc in her native Brazil since moving to the United States in 1981. (International release dates may vary)  Elias wears many hats on this project as producer\, composer\, lyricist\, arranger\, pianist and vocalist. “I am completely immersed and involved in every single detail of the music and the recording process\, from the birth of an idea until its completion through every aspect of the production until it reaches the public\,” she explains.  Along with co-producers\, Steve Rodby and Marc Johnson\, her bass playing musical partner\, Elias ventured ‘home’ and recruited a splendid cast of Brazilian musicians that include electric bassist Marcelo Mariano; guitarists Marcus Teixeira and Roberto Menescal; drummers Edu Ribeiro and Rafael Barata; and percussionists Mauro Refosco and Marivaldo dos Santos.  Elias peppered the sessions with delightful special guest performances from Mark Kibble and the multi-GRAMMY® Award-winning gospel vocal group Take 6; her singer/songwriter-daughter Amanda Brecker; one of Brazil’s most celebrated R&B stars\, Ed Motta; and the distinguished bossa nova composer Roberto Menescal.  Elias also invited Rob Mathes to handle orchestral arrangements on seven of the 12 tracks\, which were recorded in London at the legendary Abbey Road Studios. “It’s so touching to hear the music unfold\,” she says of the orchestral arrangements after they were overdubbed onto the São Paulo sessions. “You can see the musical notes on paper\, but it’s something else to hear them realized and performed by members of the London Symphonic Orchestra.” COL channel name VAL Concord Records	0

Cale)  Arranged By -- Bill Boatman\, J.J. Cale Drums -- Jimmy Karstein Guitar -- J.J. Cale Keyboards -- Leon Russell Producer -- J.J. Cale\, Snuff Garrett  This was a Snuff Garrett project as a compilation album of covers of numbers that were popular on Hollywood's Sunset Strip. These were combined with newly-written numbers by J.J. Cale who was a member of the makeshift group assembled for the recording\, who called themselves "The Leathercoated Minds".  ------------------------  "Along Comes Mary" is a song composed by Tandyn Almer\, originally recorded in 1966 by American sunshine pop band the Association. It was the group's first hit\, released on their debut album\, And Then... Along Comes the Association (1966).  Background  "Along Comes Mary" is sung from the point of view of a once-disillusioned young man talking about the "tribulations no one ever sees" and who "curse[s] those faults in me." The singer believes Mary gives him comfort and improves his life. An acquaintance of Almer claimed in an interview that "Mary" refers to marijuana\, though it is unclear if Almer ever confirmed this. In the Young People's Concert titled What Is a Mode? Leonard Bernstein explained that the song was composed in the Dorian mode.  Bloodhound Gang version  American rock band Bloodhound Gang recorded a version of "Along Comes Mary" with new punk music to accompany the lyrics. It first appeared on the 1998 soundtrack to the film Half Baked before appearing on Bloodhound Gang's third studio album\, Hooray for Boobies\, the following year. "Along Comes Mary" was released as the album's first single in May 1999 and reached No. 5 in Austria\, No. 6 in Germany\, and No. 13 in Switzerland. The song was certified gold in both Austria and Germany.  Other covers  In 1966\, Hugh Masekela included the song on his album Hugh Masekela's Next Album\, and in 1967\, Cal Tjader covered it for his album Along Comes Cal. That same year\, Baja Marimba Band's had a minor hit with their cover of the song.  In 1968\, George Benson included a version on his album Giblet Gravy\, and in 1986 a cover appeared on R. Stevie Moore's album Glad Music.  In 1995\, the Manhattan Transfer covered the song for their album Tonin'\, and the following year\, 24-7 Spyz covered it for their album 6.  In 2005\, a cover of the song appeared on the Guess Who's compilation album Let's Go\, and Plainsong also released a cover on their self-titled album.  ------------------------  Lyrics  Every time I think that I'm the only one who's lonely someone calls on me. And every now and then I spend my time in rhyme and verse and curse those faults in me.  And then along comes Mary And does she want to give me kicks\, and be my steady chick and give me pick of memories Or maybe rather gather tales of all the fails and tribulations no one ever sees.  When we met I was sure out to lunch Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch.  When vague desire is the fire in the eyes of chicks whose sickness is the games they play. And when the masquerade is played and neighbor folks make jokes as who is most to blame today.  And then along comes Mary And does she want to set them free\, and let them see reality from where she got her name. And will they struggle much when told that such a tender touch as hers will make them not the same.  When we met I was sure out to lunch Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch\, sweet as the punch\, sweet as the punch\, sweet as the punch\, sweet as the punch.

COL title VAL My Donald COL performer VAL Rachel Unthank & The Winterset	COL video title VAL Bill Withers - Who Is He (And What Is He to You) COL description VAL Bill Withers - Who Is He (And What Is He to You)  William Harrison "Bill" Withers\, Jr. (born July 4\, 1938) is an American singer-songwriter and musician who performed and recorded from 1970 until 1985. Some of his best-known songs are "Lean on Me"\, "Ain't No Sunshine"\, "Use Me"\, "Just the Two of Us"\, "Lovely Day"\, and "Grandma's Hands". His life was recently the subject of the documentary film Still Bill. Withers was born the youngest of thirteen children in the small coal-mining town of Slab Fork\, West Virginia. Raised in nearby Beckley\, West Virginia\, Withers was thirteen years old when his father died. He enlisted with the United States Navy at age eighteen and served for nine years\, during which time he became interested in singing and writing songs. Soon after his discharge from the Navy in 1970\, he relocated to Los Angeles for a musical career. Withers worked as an assembler for several different companies\, including Douglas Aircraft Corporation\, while recording demo tapes with his own money\, shopping them around and performing in clubs at night. When he debuted with the song "Ain't No Sunshine" he refused to resign his job because of his belief that the music business was a fickle industry and that he was still a novice compared to other acts.  Lyrics  A man we passed just tried to stare me down  And when I looked at you\, you looked at the ground  I don't know who he is but I think that you do   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   I have something in my heart and in your eyes  Tell me he's not someone just passin' by  And when you cleared your throat was that your cue   Dag gummit dag  Who is he and what is he to you   Now when I add the sum of you and me  I get confused and I keep coming up with three  You're too much for one man but not enough for two   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Hey you tell me man don't have not much for intuition  That what you really think or are you wishin'  Before you wreck your old home be certain of the new   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you COL channel name VAL Alf	0

Was the singer for several different bands in the 1920s\, including the Colonial Club Orchestra and The Regents Club Orchestra. He disappeared from public view in 1934 when he was laid off from work in the record industry as an executive and then genuinely disappeared for good\, because no one knows what happened to him after that. This was one of his biggest hits\, charting at #25 in 1930 for the year. Also a big(ger) hit for Nat Skrillet in the same year.  Photo is of the Regents Club Dance Hall In Brighton\, England. It was converted to a bingo hall in 1967 and then bulldozed in 1974\, a victim of changing taste in dance music.  50 hits on 9/26/11 100 hits on 11/10/11 250 hits on 3/16/12 500 htis on 9/6/12 COL channel name VAL MusicProjectX	0

Purchase from the label: http://www.paradiseofbachelors.com/shop/pob-21 Purchase from Bandcamp: https://paradiseofbachelors.bandcamp.com/album/ambsace Other options: http://lnk.to/PoB21  The second album of astonishing duets by guitarists James Elkington (who has toured and/or recorded with Jeff Tweedy\, Richard Thompson\, and Steve Gunn\, among others) and Nathan Salsburg (an accomplished soloist deemed by NPR “one of those names we’ll all associate with American folk guitar”) is a sublime suite of nimble\, filigreed compositions by two singular stylists.

It was released on their debut album A Flock of Seagulls in 1982 and was its most successful single\, reaching number 9 in the United States and number 1 in Australia.  Single  The single was promoted by a distinctive music video in which the band members performed in a room covered in aluminum foil and mirrors. The cameras used to film the video are clearly visible in many of the background reflections\, their stands also covered in foil. The video is a homage to Brian Eno and Robert Fripp's (No Pussyfooting) album cover\, which was also respectively portrayed by The Strokes for their single\, "The End Has No End" two decades later. The video received heavy rotation on MTV in the summer of 1982\, and helped the single to become a hit. The video features a different edit of "I Ran" than the album version; the introduction was greatly shortened.  The band toured the United States extensively to promote the single\, supporting Squeeze on their 1982 tour. As well as reaching #9 on the Billboard Hot 100\, "I Ran" peaked at #3 on the Mainstream Rock chart and #8 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. Subsequently the album reached number 10 on the Billboard 200.  Despite success in the States and Australia\, the single did not enjoy similar success in the band's home country (United Kingdom)\, failing to make the top 40.  In an interview on the VH1 special 100 Greatest Songs of the '80s\, Mike Score said that he resents the song\, but plays it live because people enjoy it. "I Ran" was listed at #55 on the countdown. In VH1's 100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders of the 80s\, the song was listed at #2\, with Mike Score's interview played again.  Although considered an '80s New Wave classic\, the song experienced somewhat of a revival in 2002 as the signature theme for the video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City; being played during the game's television commercials and during gameplay as one of the songs in the playlist for radio station Wave 103.  Along with the Bowling for Soup cover\, it was also used as the theme song for the English dub of the anime series Knights of the Zodiac which was later removed from the air during its first season.  The song briefly featured in the Dead Zone Season 2 episode 'Playing God'\, heard during a party scene. It can also be heard during a nightclub scene in the 2005 Nick Love film The Business.  The master recording is available as a playable song in Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s as well as the rebooted version of Karaoke Revolution. The song was from the TV show Everybody Hates Chris entitled Everybody Hates the Last Day  It was performed by the Ska Rangers in the film The Hangover: Part II during the closing scene.  Also\, Fez sung a verse in That 70's Show during one of the "Circles" in the fourth season's opener.  Cover versions  "I Ran" has been covered by a number of artists:  Tori Amos covered the song on her Original Sinsuality/Summer Of Sin Tour in Denver\, during Piano Bar Time. Her version was released with the rest of the show in the 3rd CD of The Original Bootlegs.  Assemblage 23 recorded the song for the 1997 compilation Newer Wave.  Cranial Screwtop recorded a version of the song for their 2006 album "Too Fast for Technology".  Terminal Choice's cover of the song is included on the bonus disk of their 2006 album New Born Enemies.  Bowling for Soup covered the song for the 2003 re-release of their album Drunk Enough to Dance and their "Punk Rock 101" single. Both the original and the punk cover are the theme song of the American version of Saint Seiya\, also known as Knights of the Zodiac.  Hidden in Plain View recorded the song on the covers compilation album Punk Goes 80s.  In Dance Dance Revolution: Hottest Party 2\, Spacebar vs Naughty G covered this song.  Darude and Blake Lewis released a cover in 2008.  Nickelback covered the song during their Dark Horse Tour in 2010. It was sung by guitarist/vocalist Ryan Peake.  Slim Thug also took the bass line of this song to produce his single "I Run"  Umphrey's Mcgee covered the song during a performance at the Birmingham Southern College on 4/9/05\, however they have played it many times before.  Ska Rangers covered the song which featured on the film and soundtrack of The Hangover: Part II. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	1

Real Around the Fountain Q-Burn's Abstract Message  ------------------------  "Panic" is a song by the British alternative rock band The Smiths\, written by singer Morrissey and guitarist Johnny Marr. The first recording to feature new member Craig Gannon\, "Panic" bemoans the state of contemporary pop music\, and implores its listeners to "burn down the disco" and "hang the DJ" in retaliation. "Panic" was released by Rough Trade Records as a non-album single in 1986\, reaching number 11 in the UK Singles Chart.  Background and recording  The Smiths recorded "Panic" at London's Livingston Studios in May 1986. It was the group's first recording sessions since they completed work on their third album The Queen Is Dead six months earlier. During the interim period\, bassist Andy Rourke had been sacked due to his drug addiction. The band recruited Craig Gannon to replace him\, but after they re-employed Rourke\, guitarist Johnny Marr offered Gannon a position as second guitarist.  Composition and lyrics  A story circulated as the basis for the song is that days before recording the song\, Marr and Morrissey were listening to BBC Radio One when a news report announced the Chernobyl disaster. Straight after the report\, disc jockey Steve Wright played the song "I'm Your Man" by pop duo Wham!. "I remember actually saying\, 'What the fuck has this got to do with people's lives?'" Marr recalled. "We hear about Chernobyl\, then\, seconds later\, we're expected to jump around to 'I'm Your Man'". While Marr subsequently stated that the account was exaggerated\, he commented that it was a likely influence on Morrissey's lyrics.[4] The band even commissioned a t-shirt featuring Wright's portrait and the phrase "Hang the DJ!"  Journalist Nick Kent described "Panic" as a mandate for "rock terrorism". Musically\, the song is based around a rotation between the G and E minor chords that mimicks "Metal Guru" by the glam rock band T.Rex. The song begins with Morrissey mentioning chaos unravelling throughout Britain and Ireland (specifically naming locales such as Dublin\, Dundee\, Carlisle and Humberside). In the second part of the song\, Morrissey reveals that the source of this chaos is pop music\, which in his words "Says nothing to me about my life". In reaction\, Morrissey implores listeners to "Burn down the disco" and "hang the DJ"\, the latter lyrics repeated with the addition of a chorus of schoolchildren. Morrissey considered the fact that the song appeared on daytime British radio a "tiny revolution" in its own way\, as it aired amongst the very music it criticised.  Release and reception  "Panic" drew fire from critics who construed Morrissey's lyrics to have a racist connotation\, due to their disparagement of the "disco" and the "DJ". The criticism was intensified by comments Morrissey made in a September 1986 Melody Maker interview with Frank Owen\, where the singer denounced a "black pop conspiracy". Marr in particular was incensed by the article and threatened to "kick the living shit" out of the writer if he crossed the band's path. Marr countered that "disco music" could not be equated with "black music"; he argued\, "To those who took offence at the 'burn down the disco' line [. . .] I'd say please show me the black members of New Order!"  "Panic" reached number eleven on the UK Singles Chart and stayed on the chart for eight weeks. The single also stayed on the Irish Singles Chart for five weeks\, reaching a peak of number seven\, and reached number thirty-two on the Dutch Top 40. "Panic" was voted Single of the Year by the annual NME readers poll\, and also ("somewhat incongruously"\, noted Smiths biographer Simon Goddard) ranked sixth in the Best Dance Record category. In 2007\, NME placed "Panic" at number 21 in its list of the 50 Greatest Indie Anthems Ever. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

I'm still not sure what to make of same sex marriage. I am a stout conservative however I believe that people should be free to share their lives with whom they wish or fall in love with regardless of sexual barriers and live it as they see fit as long as harm is not brought to others\, judgments I leave to God\, that is regarding that my rights are not encroached upon by the rights of others.  This being said I do believe that if not marriage as defined between a men and a woman there should be similar laws that protect and gives the proper rights to any two persons who form a serious home and a relationship together.  I do have friends who are in such relationships\, I do not condone discrimination based on sexual preferences and to them I dedicate this record by the great Charles Aznavour\,  it tells a touching and very lonely story.

The three siblings -- now aged 15\,18 and 17 - first came together onstage at a country and rockabilly jam in a North London pub. Over five years later the 50s music\, fashion and technology obsessed family have built a massive word of mouth audience through a stream of rapturously received gigs and festival appearances and are ready to release their first long player on Rob da Bank's Sunday Best label on 28th July 2008.  The single 'Going Up The Country' is a perfectly rounded summer holiday feel-good jam\, full of harmonica solos\, handclaps and lyrics about leaving the city smog for fairer country hills. Coming out on 7"\, authentic 78rpm 10"\, CD and download on 7th July 2008.

Sammen skal vi leve hver søster og hver bror\, små barn av regnbuen og en frodig jord.  Noen tror det ikke nytter\, noen kaster tiden bort med prat\, noen tror visst vi kan leve av plast og syntetisk mat\, og noen stjeler fra de unge som blir sendt ut for å slåss\, noen stjeler fra de mange som kommer etter oss.  En himmel full av stjerner\, blått hav så langt du ser\, en jord der blomster gror\, kan du ønske mer?  Sammen skal vi leve hver søster og hver bror\, små barn av regnbuen og en frodig jord.

COL title VAL I'm Blue (The Gong-Gong Song) COL performer VAL The Ikettes	COL video title VAL The Newbeats -_I'm Blue - (The Gong-Gong)_1964 Hickory.wmv COL description VAL Texan Larry Henley first performed with the Dean and Marc Combo in 1962. Business links with Nashville-based Hickory Records owner Wesley Rose rapidly led to solo releases by Larry Henley and also\, Dean and Marc.  In June 1964\, Larry\, Dean and Marc got together and cut an unusual\, falsetto-driven demo of the Everly Brothers' "Bye Bye Love." The song's composer\, Bouldleaux Bryant\, heard the dazzling demo and immediately convinced Wesley Rose to sign the trio to a separate\, (third!) recording contract. Fred Foster\, owner of Monument Records\, suggested the "Newbeats" name.  Holland Picture Sleeve - Bye Bye Love was never released on 45 in the USA  "Bye Bye Love\," "Break Away (From That Boy)" (later a #34 hit in Cash Box) and the Chevrolet Corvair tune "Tough Little Buggy" were duly recorded on June 28\, 1964. At the last minute Rose's brother-in-law suggested a song called "Bread And Butter." Dean Mathis created a new\, authoritative arrangement on the spot\, showcasing Larry Henley's scorching\, gospel-influenced falsetto.  When released\, "Bread And Butter" was buried on the 'B' side of "Tough Little Buggy." But DJs at Detroit's WKNR radio flipped the single and "Bread And Butter" blasted onto the WKNR survey the week of July 16\, 1964\, soon peaking at #1.  Nationally "Bread And Butter" shot to #2 and attained Gold sales.  The Newbeats' jaw-dropping national TV debut took place Wednesday\, September 30\, 1964 on ABC-TV's 'Shindig.'  An appearance on 'American Bandstand' came next. The group then stormed Europe via Holland's 'Grand Gala du Disque 1964\,' a widely seen\, four hour television spectacular.   Billboard September 12\, 1964  In addition to "A Patent On Love" (originally intended for Joey "Midnight Mary" Powers) and "Pink Dally Rue" (later recorded by Jimmy Elledge and Robin Wilson)\, the 'Bread & Butter' album included "Thou Shalt Not Steal\," penned by longtime Hickory confederate John D. Loudermilk ("Norman\," "Talk Back Trembling Lips"). Dick and Deedee recognized the potential of the album cut and soon lodged a version of "Thou Shalt Not Steal" at #13 on the charts (Warner single 5482). Another Loudermilk tune\, the #16 "Everything's Alright\," became the Newbeats' follow-up to "Bread And Butter."  From January 22 through February 13\, 1965\, the Newbeats toured Australia and New Zealand with the Rolling Stones\, Roy Orbison and Rolf Harris. During the tour\, Larry Henley became very close to Mick Jagger and the two even planned an album project. Hickory owner Wesley Rose managed tour headliner Roy Orbison. The Newbeats later recorded Orbison's "Oh\, Pretty Woman" and "Lookin' For Love."  "(The Bees Are For The Birds) The Birds Are For The Bees\," was written by the composers of "Bread And Butter\," Larry Parks and Jay Turnbow\, with help from Bob Finnicum. While "Bread And Butter" had referred to sex in sympathetic gastronomic terms\, the refreshingly naïve "Birds Are For The Bees" found Larry Henley (27)\, Dean Mathis (28) and Marc Mathis (25) innocently claiming\, "Grown-ups tell me the birds and the bees do other things than live in trees" and concluding\, to the astonishment of angst-ridden teen listeners\, "I don't care if they can fly it's got nothing to do with you and I."  Issued with two different front covers\, the April 1965 album 'Big Beat Sounds' showcased the Newbeats' most recent single sides. The aforementioned Larry Parks\, Jay Turnbow and Bob Finnicum contributed three additional quirky tunes to the album. 'Big Beat Sounds' also contained valuable material such as Goffin and King's lead-off cut "I Can't Hear You No More" and Keith Colley and Nancie Mantz's closer "Human Kindness."  Colley and Mantz had penned tunes for Rick Nelson ("That's All She Wrote")\, Bobby Bare ("Talk Me Some Sense") and Skeeter Davis ("Ladder Of Success"). Nanci Mantz later co-wrote several songs for the Electric Prunes\, including "I Had Too Much To Dream (Last Night)."  The driving "Little Child" was released as a single in the summer of 1965. Oddly\, it did not drive the national charts wild. But the group's publicity blitz continued unabated with appearances on ABC-TV's 'Where The Action Is' on July 20 and August 25\, 1965.  The Newbeats scored a major comeback with the September 1965 single\, "Run\, Baby Run." The #12 hit boasted exquisite vocal harmonies and a stomping Motown beat. And "Run\, Baby Run" had legs; in 1971 it went Top Ten in England. Roy Orbison and the Tremelos even cut versions of the influential tune.  November 1965 saw 'Run\, Baby Run\,' the Newbeats' third and final Hickory album. Remakes of the Isley Brothers' "This Old Heart" and the Supremes' "Come See About Me" boldly demonstrated the influence of Motown soul while covers of "Help" and "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction" recognized the Beatles and Rolling Stones.

Visa ble presentert under turneen «Vers og viiiiiiser. Lyriske utskeielser ved Harald Sverdrup og Alf Cranner» i 1966\, og utgitt på LP året samme høst.   Sjømannsvise har blitt en av Cranners mest folkekjære viser\, og den har kommet på flere plateinnspillinger siden.   Den svenske trubaduren Cornelis Vreeswijk lagde en egen tekstversjon av Sjømannsvise som han kalt Ågren.   Han oppgav opprinnelig melodien som «norsk folketone»\, men førte opp Cranner som komponist da han gav ut visa på plata Poem\, ballader och lite blues i 1970.  En sjømannsvise er en vise om sjømenn og livet ombord\, eller en vise som er populær blant sjømenn.   Sjømannsviser kan deles i to grupper. Sjantier som var arbeidssangen ombord på seilskutene og frivaktsviser som var populære sanger blant sjømenn. COL channel name VAL Cauldron20	0

COL title VAL I Wonder How the Old Folks Are at Home COL performer VAL Ralph Stanley and The Clinch Mountain Boys	COL video title VAL Bill Keith Homestead on The Farm COL description VAL William Bradford Keith was born in Boston\, Massachusetts. He attended Amherst College and graduated in 1961. In 1963 he became a member of Bill Monroe's Bluegrass Boys.   Keith's recordings and performances during these nine months with Monroe permanently altered banjo playing\, and his style has become an important part of the playing styles of many banjoists. After leaving the Bluegrass Boys\, he joined "Jim Kweskin Jug Band" playing plectrum banjo. He began playing the steel guitar and soon after 1968\, found himself working together with Ian and Sylvia and Jonathan Edwards. In the 1970s Keith recorded for Rounder Records. Over the years he has performed with several other musicians\, such as Clarence White and David Grisman in Muleskinner\, Tony Trischka\, Jim Rooney and Jim Collier. Today\, Keith style is still regarded as modern or progressive in the context of bluegrass banjo playing.    Keith made a mechanical contribution to the banjo\, as well. He designed a specialized type of banjo tuning peg that facilitates changing quickly from one open tuning to another\, while playing. Earlier famed banjoist Earl Scruggs had designed a set of cams which were added to the banjo to perform this task. Keith's invention made the extra hardware unnecessary\, replacing two of the tuning machines already on the banjo — a more elegant solution. Scruggs himself became a partner in the venture for a while\, and the product was known as "Scruggs-Keith Pegs". Known today simply as Keith Pegs\, they remain the state of the art\, and Bill Keith continues to manufacture and market them personally as the primary product of his own company\, the Beacon Banjo Company.

Damita Jo\, was an American actress\, comedian\, and lounge music performer. DeBlanc was born in Austin\, Texas\,[2] the featured vocalist on recordings from Steve Gibson and the Red Caps during the 1950s.[3] She later went on to marry Gibson\, but they parted ways professionally and personally in 1959.  Credited as simply Damita Jo\, DeBlanc had some chart success in the early 1960s with two answer songs: 1960's "I'll Save the Last Dance for You" (an answer to "Save the Last Dance for Me") and 1961's "I'll Be There" (an answer to "Stand By Me"). Both songs were originally sung by Ben E. King and made the R&B top 20\, and "I'll Be There" also reached number 12 on the pop chart. In 1962 she recorded "Dance With a Dolly (With a Hole in her Stocking)"\, previously made famous by The Andrews Sisters and Bill Haley\, for Mercury Records. In 1966 she had a minor hit with a cover of the Jacques Brel song "If You Go Away."  She worked with Ray Charles\, Count Basie\, and Lionel Hampton. And\, in 1963\, she released a recording for Mercury Records with Billy Eckstine and Bobby Tucker Orchestra.  Damita Jo was later involved in comedy and toured with Redd Foxx. In 1998\, she suffered a respiratory illness and died on Christmas Day[2] in Baltimore\, Maryland. COL channel name VAL AMNON SUODAI	1

COL title VAL Funnel of Love COL performer VAL Mike Ness	COL video title VAL Arrivederci - Mario Musella COL description VAL Il video della versione radio edit di "Arrivederci"\, il brano che dà il titolo all'album inedito di Mario Musella pubblicato da Suonidelsud.su licenza KING UNIVERSAL "Arriverderci" contiene otto registrazioni realizzate nel 1975 quando Mario Musella aveva già lasciato gli Showmen intraprendendo la carriera solistica. Otto canzoni\, in gran parte cover\, in cui la voce del "nero a metà" della musica napoletana si rivela in tutta la sua carismatica espressività. Un album sospeso tra rhythm'n'blues\, rock'n'roll e tanto soul in cui spicca la presenza di alcuni "turnisti" d'eccezione che rispondono ai nomi di Pino Daniele e Enzo Avitabile. Di grande intensità le riletture di "Arrivederci"\, il capolavoro di Umberto Bindi che dà giustamente il titolo al disco; assolutamente trascinante l'interpretazione di "True fine mama" di Little Richards ; decisamente eleganti le rarefatte atmosfere della celeberrima "Giorgia on my mind" di Ray Charles" e di "Entriamo nel gioco"\, versione italiana di quella "You make me feel a brand new" portata al successo dai Simply Red" vent'anni dopo.  Ancor prima di essere un eccezionale documento storico\, "Arriverdeci" è un album che testimonia alla perfezione la grandezza di un interprete come non ce ne sono stati più.

'Classic Folk Music from Smithsonian Folkways Recordings' is available on CD and digital.  Stream/download/purchase: Smithsonian Folkways: https://folkways.si.edu/classic-folk-music-from-folkways-recordings/american-folk/music/album/smithsonian Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/album/3ZvJN4KO7r0ivacGwObKVt?si=XdZ6zndVS6SR_0xDGyfUag  We often take for granted the supremacy of artists such as Doc Watson\, Woody Guthrie\, Pete Seeger\, Lead Belly\, Big Bill Broonzy\, Brownie McGhee\, and other folk music legends. Classic Folk sheds new light on the success of the urban intellectual-driven movement that made rural white and African-American artists and their music favorites of audiences everywhere. This recording features classic performances by classic artists doing some of their classic songs during the great folksong revival of the 1940s through 1960s. It features some of the great performances from the vaults of Folkways Records. Compiled and annotated by Jeff Place.

COL title VAL Safe and Sound COL performer VAL Alex Goot feat. Luke Conard & Chad Sugg	COL video title VAL LURLEAN HUNTER  Vocal Jazz Swing. Steppin' Out With My Baby \, I Feel COL description VAL Lurlean Hunter  Singer Lurlean Hunter made five albums on her own during the second half of the '50s\, starting out as a Lonesome Gal on RCA and winding up still feeling Blue & Sentimental for Atlantic. She was discovered in Chicago where she had been singing in many clubs\, including a collaboration with drummer Red Saunders that held forth at the Club DeLisa. Hunter's move to New York City in 1955 was prompted by RCA's interest in recording her. The singer's recording career actually began before she left the Windy City at the behest of indie jazz labels\, some of them quite short-lived -- such as Seymour\, with a catalog topping out at four releases. The press described Hunter as a "blues thrush" in announcing her interpretations of three numbers actually written by the label's owner\, producer and record store owner Seymour Schwartz. The latter promotional blurb inevitably told some truth about Hunter's stylistic traits\, if not her relation to winged fauna. Her recordings were more about rhythm & blues and pop than jazz\, yet were done in an era when such sessions often involved fine mainstream jazz players in the accompaniment. The 1956Night Life\, for example\, featured pianist Hank Jones and tenor saxophonist Al Cohn. Blue & Sentimental -- with arrangements by the progressive Jimmy Giuffre -- was reissued in 2000 as a split CD also including an album by fellow singer Betty Bennett\, a former wife of pianist André Previn.Hunter's final recordings were done in 1964\, at which point she was still well under 40 years old. She is known to have died young\, although details of this tragedy are murky. In one version of the story she was knocked off by a mobster lover\, yet whether anybody was really that mean to Lurlean cannot be completely confirmed.

The record is an American Pathe and the phonograph is a rare Pathe Solophone Model 125 produced around 1916-1917. Europe led this extremely successful early Black Jazz Band comprised of African American Soldiers\, on a triumphant and successful  tour of European Cities during WWI\, and the band led the Triumphant returning U.S. servicemen Down 5th Avenue in New York City at the end of the War.  Tragically what was to be surely a brilliant and successful career was cut short when Lt. Europe died as the result of a fatal knife wound inflicted during a scuffle with one of his band members while the Band was on Tour in Boston\, Mass. in 1919\, and only a matter of days after this recording session at the Pathe Studios.

Visa ble presentert under turneen «Vers og viiiiiiser. Lyriske utskeielser ved Harald Sverdrup og Alf Cranner» i 1966\, og utgitt på LP året samme høst.   Sjømannsvise har blitt en av Cranners mest folkekjære viser\, og den har kommet på flere plateinnspillinger siden.   Den svenske trubaduren Cornelis Vreeswijk lagde en egen tekstversjon av Sjømannsvise som han kalt Ågren.   Han oppgav opprinnelig melodien som «norsk folketone»\, men førte opp Cranner som komponist da han gav ut visa på plata Poem\, ballader och lite blues i 1970.  En sjømannsvise er en vise om sjømenn og livet ombord\, eller en vise som er populær blant sjømenn.   Sjømannsviser kan deles i to grupper. Sjantier som var arbeidssangen ombord på seilskutene og frivaktsviser som var populære sanger blant sjømenn. COL channel name VAL Cauldron20	0

The great songwriting team\, which had already produced dozens of hit songs that would go on to become standards — including The Look of Love\, Walk On By and I Say a Little Prayer — reinvigorated musical theatre with an energizing score.  Burt Bacharach has had 47 top ten hits and nine #1 songs. He's the recipient of three Academy Awards and six Grammys\, and is an inductee into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Promises\, Promises ran for over 1200 performances\, won two Tony Awards\, and was the recipient of a Grammy Award.

COL title VAL Why Can't We Live Together COL performer VAL Joan Osborne	COL video title VAL NYSF Threepenny Opera - 19 - Call From the Grave COL description VAL This is an LP transfer of the 1976 New York Shakespeare Festival's revival production of "The Threepenny Opera."  This recording should not be confused with the original 1954 New York production recording\, nor the 1994 Donmar Warehouse production recording in England.  Unlike Marc Blitzstein's version which ran during the 1950's for six years and featured the incomparable Lotte Lenya\, this translation is less sanitized and more in keeping with the seedy and sexual nature of the original german play.    From the liner notes to the album - "the successful Blitzstein version was an adaptation rather than a translation\, and in comparing it to the original\, we were surprised at the extent to which his treatment vitiated the political and sexual thrust which gives the work its relentless power.  Blitzstein sweetened and cleaned up Brecht's unsparing lyrics\, partially in deference to stage censorship...but in doing so he in many instances changed Brecht's meanings around entirely\, and throughout he softened the impact of Brecht's biting ferocity.  He also attempted to make the lyrics more 'singable' by fitting them into conventional musical patterns\, and in this he succeeded admirably."  The translation used for this revival was prepared by Ralph Maheim and John Willett; the full text can be found in their edition of Brecht's Collected Plays\, Volume 2.  A hardcover edition was also published in conjunction with the revival.  This revival was directed by conceptual theater artist Richard Foreman\, and starred Raul Julia and Ellen Greene\, both of whom were nominated for Tony Awards.  It was produced by Joseph Papp and the New York Shakespeare Festival at the Vivian Beaumont Theatre at Lincoln Center.  Additional information regarding the production\, including cast list\, can be found at the Internet Broadway Database's listing for this revival at http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=3835 ...  As of June 2007\, this cast album has not been released or reissued on CD; it was originally made available in 1976 on LP\, and this is an LP transfer.  As such\, the quality is not CD quality  - there will occasionally be noise\, popping\, or hissing.

COL title VAL I Threw Away the Rose COL performer VAL Cal Smith	COL video title VAL The Clevers - A Swingin Safari COL description VAL Idos de 1962. Cinco rapazes\, se unem para ensaiar música\, e formam um "conjunto musical"\, como se dizia na época\, o qual torna-se gradativamente conhecido como THE CLEVERS. Estilo largamente baseado no que fazia então os conjuntos norte-americanos THE SHADOWS ou THE VENTURES. Música instrumental com bateria\, guitarra base\, contra baixo\, guitarra solo\, órgão elétrico e saxofone.  Mas os nossos incríveis futuros músicos de sucesso também cantavam\, cabendo ao vocalista Mingo\, a responsabilidade de se tornar um cantor de verdade.   Um radialista (DJ)\, chamado Antonio Aguillar\, com o programa RITMOS DA JUVENTUDE na Rádio Nacional de São Paulo\, responsável pelo descobrimento de vários conjuntos\, resolve ser o mentor dos The Clevers\, apresentando-os à gravadora Continental. Palmeira\, diretor artístico da Continental não teve dúvida em contratar os The Clevers para o seu "cast"\, e junto com Alfredo Corleto do Departamento de Divulgação da gravadora\, marcaram um encontro com Antonio Aguillar\, no programa Enzo de Almeida Pasos\, e ali foi assinado o contrato\, perante os telespectadores.  Logo\, gravaram um 78 rpm e em seguida um LP (ENCONTRO COM THE CLEVERS- TWIST).  Já fazendo muito sucesso\, resolveu empreender uma excursão mundial\, no auge da Beatlemania. Não se tem muitas referências sobre esta viagem\, mas é famosa a história do caso (real ou fictício\, quem sabe?) entre o baterista Netinho com a cantora italiana de grande sucesso na época Rita Pavone.  Antes de iniciarem nova excursão de 40 dias para a Argentina\, rompem com o empresário Antonio Aguillar (o descobridor do grupo)\, que detinha os direitos do nome THE CLEVERS. Os membros dos Incríveis tentam comprar a marca\, mas não chegam a um acordo.  Na volta ao Brasil\, descobrem que tem um outro grupo brasileiro gravando discos com o nome de The Clevers. Disputas do nome do grupo à parte\, eles resolvem adotar o apelido brasileiro OS INCRÍVEIS\, tornando-se então o nome oficial do grupo.  Lançam grandes sucessos cantando em vários idiomas como o italiano\, espanhol e inglês. Chegam a filmar um longa metragem\, no estilo dos Beatles\, chamado OS INCRÍVEIS NESTE MUNDO LOUCO\, lançando o LP com o mesmo nome.  Atingindo o auge do sucesso no Brasil\, gravam o LP OS INCRÍVEIS INTERNACIONAIS\, com canções em português\, inglês e japonês.  Corria o ano de 1968 e 1969\, OS INCRÍVEIS estavam no auge do sucesso\, realizando shows ao vivo no Brasil todo\, e com suas músicas tocando em todas as rádios. É dessa época os mega sucessos ERA UM GAROTO QUE COMO EU AMAVA OS BEATLES E OS ROLLING STONES\, O MILIONÁRIO (2a. versão)\, CZARDAS\, ISRAEL\, TE AMO\, MUNDO LOUCO\, MENINA\, KOKORONO-NIJI\, e outros mais.

Classic Folk sheds new light on the success of the urban intellectual-driven movement that made rural white and African-American artists and their music favorites of audiences everywhere.

COL title VAL Who Is He and What Is He to You COL performer VAL Shaun Escoffery	COL video title VAL Maddox Brothers & Rose - No Help Wanted COL description VAL The Maddox Brothers and Rose\, known as America's Most Colorful Hillbilly Band from the 1930s to the 1950s\, consisted of four brothers\, Fred\, Cal\, Cliff and Don Maddox\, along with their sister Rose. Cliff died in 1949 and was replaced by brother Henry. The group disbanded in 1956.  The family hailed from Boaz\, Alabama\, but rode the rails and hitch hiked to California in 1933 when the band members were still children\, following the failed efforts of their sharecropper parents during the early part of the Depression. They were a little in advance of the flood of Okies who were to flood the state in the 30s. They struggled to make a living as intinerant fruit and vegetable pickers following the harvest as far north as Washington state\, and as far east as Arizona\, as well as in the San Joaquin Valley. They often worked from dawn to dusk\, sleeping and eating on the ground.  Having settled in Modesto\, the family developed their musical ability and\, in 1937 performed on the radio\, sponsored by a local furniture store. In 1939 they entered a hillbilly band competition at the centenial Sacramento State Fair after driving to Sacramento in their Model A. When they took the stage they tore through "Sally Let Your Bangs Hang Down" with rocking rhythms and risque lyrics. They became\, officially\, California's best hillbilly band.  The brothers and Rose appeared at places such as the 97th Street Corral in Los Angles.  From 1946-1951 the group recorded for 4 Star Records (Hollywood)\, then for Columbia Records. Some 4 Star masters were leased and released by US.-Decca Records at the beginning of the 1950s. The following quotes are from Rose Maddox. "We were called hillbilly singers - not country - then. No\, none of this country music then. People just called us hillbilly... People tell me that I was one of the first women to sing what I sang - country boogie. I guess I was. There was no rock 'n' roll in those early days\, before 1955. Only country boogie. My brothers also played that way. We called it country then.  The Maddox's material ranged from the country standards of Hank Williams and Merle Travis\, cowboy songs\, to the Western swing of Bob Wills\, to old-time\, folk\, and church singing\, to jazz\, swing\, boogie woogie and even a taste of early rock and roll.  Fred Maddox played upright bass using the "slap bass" technique as early as 1937.[5] This trademark backbeat\, a slapping bass style\, helped drive a broad change in popular music\, sporting a faster\, immediately discernible rhythm that came to be known as rockabilly.  Fred Maddox's bass is displayed at the Experience Music Project in Seattle. "They wanted his bass because they believe he might have hit the first note of rock 'n' roll on it.

COL title VAL Dinner for One Please\, James COL performer VAL Hal Kemp and His Orchestra	COL video title VAL NYSF Threepenny Opera - 07 - Liebeslied (Look at the Moon over Soho) COL description VAL This is an LP transfer of the 1976 New York Shakespeare Festival's revival production of "The Threepenny Opera."  This recording should not be confused with the original 1954 New York production recording\, nor the 1994 Donmar Warehouse production recording in England.  Unlike Marc Blitzstein's version which ran during the 1950's for six years and featured the incomparable Lotte Lenya\, this translation is less sanitized and more in keeping with the seedy and sexual nature of the original german play.    From the liner notes to the album - "the successful Blitzstein version was an adaptation rather than a translation\, and in comparing it to the original\, we were surprised at the extent to which his treatment vitiated the political and sexual thrust which gives the work its relentless power.  Blitzstein sweetened and cleaned up Brecht's unsparing lyrics\, partially in deference to stage censorship...but in doing so he in many instances changed Brecht's meanings around entirely\, and throughout he softened the impact of Brecht's biting ferocity.  He also attempted to make the lyrics more 'singable' by fitting them into conventional musical patterns\, and in this he succeeded admirably."  The translation used for this revival was prepared by Ralph Maheim and John Willett; the full text can be found in their edition of Brecht's Collected Plays\, Volume 2.  A hardcover edition was also published in conjunction with the revival.  This revival was directed by conceptual theater artist Richard Foreman\, and starred Raul Julia and Ellen Greene\, both of whom were nominated for Tony Awards.  It was produced by Joseph Papp and the New York Shakespeare Festival at the Vivian Beaumont Theatre at Lincoln Center.  Additional information regarding the production\, including cast list\, can be found at the Internet Broadway Database's listing for this revival at http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=3835 ...  As of June 2007\, this cast album has not been released or reissued on CD; it was originally made available in 1976 on LP\, and this is an LP transfer.  As such\, the quality is not CD quality  - there will occasionally be noise\, popping\, or hissing.

COL title VAL Pride and Joy COL performer VAL Tomas Nicholas	COL video title VAL The Charlie Daniels Band - Pride And Joy.wmv COL description VAL Tailgate Party This CD contains some of the greatest rock songs of all time. Originally made legendary by some of the south's best rock bands\, Charlie adds his own unique sound to each song. Originals\, live and studio versions make this collection live up to its' name by being a great one to pull out during a "Tailgate Party."   Description      13 Tracks previously released in 1999     Engineered\, Produced and Mixed by: Ron W. Griffin     Executive Producer: David Corlew  Guide Review - Charlie Daniels Band - Tailgate Party  Included on this very southern rock flavored collection are live versions of "The Legend of Wooley Swamp" and "The Devil Went Down to Georgia." With both songs being so well known and played a gazillion times\, it was refreshing to hear them live and just slightly different from what we are normally accustomed to.  "The South's Gonna Do It Again" had an added bonus to it by having a very early on in his career performance by Keith Urban\, showing us some very impressive guitar solo's. Remakes of ZZ Top's "Sharp Dressed Man" and Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Freebird" were very captivating and showed off some incredible fiddle playing by Charlie. Probably one of my most favorites was CDB's remake of the song made famous by Hootie and the Blowfish\, "Let Her Cry." Charlie has always been well known for his playing but under rated for his vocals. This song shows off just how well he can deliver some very heartfelt emotions and I really enjoyed listening to this new version.  If you have ever appreciated CDB\, you will really like this release. If for nothing else\, the diversity of the genre's and CDB being able to add the country sound without destroying the memory of the song.

Das Stück hier ist eine gelungene Collage ausJim Webb-Titeln (Where's The Playground Susie\, When It Was Done\, The Hive\, First Hymn From The Grand Terrace)\, fast schon zu einer eigenen kleinen Pop-Oper zusammengewebt\, erschienen 1969 auf dem Album "Love Token".

COL title VAL Vieni Vieni COL performer VAL Bob Crosby and His Orchestra	COL video title VAL DENI HINES & CHRISTINE ANU - TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS COL description VAL Two of Australias most loved and successful female recording artists\, Deni Hines and Christine Anu\, are takin it to the streets again in 2009 after the success of their 2008 East-Coast of Australia tour.    On the first tour we had such a great time\, that we wanted to do it all over again\, especially when we have such a great cause to promote such as the Salvation Army and Oasis Youth Support Network. We feel privileged to be able to help says Christine & Deni.    In a two hour show\, this sassy duo will perform their classic hits and favourite timeless songs along with some special duets\, including their own rendition of the Doobie Brothers hit TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS.   While promoting their 2008 tour\, Deni and Christine so happened to be performing one of their show duets TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS on the Today Show (Nine Network\, Australia). On the same show was a heartfelt segment about the plight of homelessness in Australia accompanied by Captain Paul Mould of the Salvation Armys Oasis Youth Support Network\, who take care and provide much needed services for the homeless and youth of Australia (who come from all walks of life.)  No less than 5 minutes after walking off set\, Christine and Deni turned to each other and said weve got to do something to help and the recording of TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS was set in motion.   Deni and Christine will release their version of TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS on 15 November 2008 (Nationwide) with fifty percent (50%) of profits going to the Salvation Armys Youth Homelessness Oasis Foundation and the Everyone Is Homeless Fund.  On Wednesday\, 17th December Christine and Deni will also stage a free Christmas concert version of their TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS show exclusively for the Salvation Armys Youth Homelessness Oasis Foundation and the homeless people of Sydney.   For further information on Salvation Armys Youth Homelessness Oasis Foundation and the Everyone Is Homeless Fund\, please refer to www.oasis.salvos.org.au  In the ABS Census 2001 (The 2006 Census data has not been finalized)\, there were 100\,000 homeless people (men\, women and children) across Australia\, one third (36\,173) are youth between 12-24 years of age.  Only 14.25% of homeless people were able to stay in services funded through SAAP (Supported Accommodation Assistance Program) jointly funded by both the Commonwealth and State Governments.  Christine and Deni would like to thank the following companies and people for donating their time and services free of charge of the purposes of this donation campaign drive -  301 Studios\, Sing Sing Studios\, David and Anthony @ DNA Songs\, Tony Espie\, David Walker at Stepford Audio\, John Adams\, Franco Raggatt\, Barbara Griffin\, Cameron Undy\, Michael Rohanek and Rob Thompson.

Banes Drums\, Percussion -- Jimmy Young  ------------------------  "Fire" is a 1968 song by Arthur Brown\, Vincent Crane\, Mike Finesilver and Peter Ker. Performed by The Crazy World of Arthur Brown\, it was released as a single and on the band's debut album\, also called The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. The single made #1 in the UK (in August 1968) and Canada. In October\, it made #2 in the US Billboard charts and #19 in Australia. It also made #6 in the Netherlands. "Fire" sold over one million copies\, and was awarded a gold disc.  The song is an example of the psychedelic rock of the period\, though its lack of guitars or bass guitar distinguished it from many of its contemporaries. The lead instrument in this case was Vincent Crane's Hammond electronic organ\, augmented by an orchestral section featuring prominent brass. The singer's opening proclamation of himself as "the god of hellfire" became a lasting epithet. The song's other memorable line is "You're Gonna Burn!!". The song ends with the sound of a wind from hell.  During live performances and in the black and white promotional television clip\, Brown performed the song wearing a burning helmet. The helmet was improvised with a leather skull cap onto which was bolted a metal dish that held lighter fluid or petrol. As the cap was not insulated\, the heat from the burning fuel quickly conducted through the fixing bolt to the top of Brown's head\, causing him considerable pain.  Two studio mixes of "Fire" have been officially released\, one in stereo and one in mono. The mono mix features no brass. Both versions are included on the CD reissue of The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. The single B-side\, "Rest Cure"\, was another track from the album.  Credit for the composition of "Fire" on the original vinyl single was to Arthur Brown and Vincent Crane only; however\, Mike Finesilver and Peter Ker successfully sued for co-credit and royalties based on melodic similarities to their song "Baby\, You're a Long Way Behind".  The song is briefly featured in the films Hot Fuzz (2007) and The Boat That Rocked (2009). It is also referenced in Julie Hearn's debut novel Follow Me Down\, and was used in the episode "Burn Victim" of My Name Is Earl.  Cover versions  The Ventures covered the song on their 1969 album Underground Fire. Lizzy Mercier Descloux covered "Fire" on her album Press Color (1979)\, drastically changing the mood and style of the track. Pete Townshend\, the single's associate producer\, covered "Fire" as a member of The Who on his 1989 album The Iron Man: A Musical. Cirith Ungol covered the song on their 1991 album Paradise Lost. The Prodigy sampled the track for "Fire/Jericho"\, which was otherwise a completely different song\, on their 1992 album Experience. Emerson\, Lake & Palmer covered the song on their 1993 4-disc compilation album The Return of the Manticore. German dark electro act AmGod covered the song several times. The most well-known version is "Fire v.2" featured on the 1994 album Half Rotten and Decayed. Though it was not a true 'cover'\, Marilyn Manson's "Lunchbox" (1995) heavily samples "Fire". UK doom metal band Cathedral covered the song on their 1996 EP Hopkins (The Witchfinder General). Die Krupps covered the song on their 1997 album Paradise Now. Dutch death metal band God Dethroned covered the song on their 1997 album The Grand Grimoire. Ozzy Osbourne included a version on his 2005 album Under Cover. The song is used in one episode of Series 3 of Monkey Dust (2005) as the Paedofinder General burns the wrongly accused paedophiles with this music in the background\, complete with bastardised lyrics. US Hip hop duo Cunninlynguists sampled the song for "Hellfire" on their 2006 album A Piece of Strange. Leningrad Cowboys covered the song in a metal style and included it on their 2006 album Zombie's Paradise. Appears in the musical Disco Inferno\, when the character Duke reveals himself to be Satan in disguise.[citation needed] Death Grips\, an experimental hip hop group backed by drummer Zach Hill\, sampled "Fire" in their song "Lord of the Game".

COL title VAL Back in My Arms Again COL performer VAL Genya Ravan	COL video title VAL Bill Withers - Who Is He (And What Is He to You) COL description VAL Bill Withers - Who Is He (And What Is He to You)  William Harrison "Bill" Withers\, Jr. (born July 4\, 1938) is an American singer-songwriter and musician who performed and recorded from 1970 until 1985. Some of his best-known songs are "Lean on Me"\, "Ain't No Sunshine"\, "Use Me"\, "Just the Two of Us"\, "Lovely Day"\, and "Grandma's Hands". His life was recently the subject of the documentary film Still Bill. Withers was born the youngest of thirteen children in the small coal-mining town of Slab Fork\, West Virginia. Raised in nearby Beckley\, West Virginia\, Withers was thirteen years old when his father died. He enlisted with the United States Navy at age eighteen and served for nine years\, during which time he became interested in singing and writing songs. Soon after his discharge from the Navy in 1970\, he relocated to Los Angeles for a musical career. Withers worked as an assembler for several different companies\, including Douglas Aircraft Corporation\, while recording demo tapes with his own money\, shopping them around and performing in clubs at night. When he debuted with the song "Ain't No Sunshine" he refused to resign his job because of his belief that the music business was a fickle industry and that he was still a novice compared to other acts.  Lyrics  A man we passed just tried to stare me down  And when I looked at you\, you looked at the ground  I don't know who he is but I think that you do   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   I have something in my heart and in your eyes  Tell me he's not someone just passin' by  And when you cleared your throat was that your cue   Dag gummit dag  Who is he and what is he to you   Now when I add the sum of you and me  I get confused and I keep coming up with three  You're too much for one man but not enough for two   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Hey you tell me man don't have not much for intuition  That what you really think or are you wishin'  Before you wreck your old home be certain of the new   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you   Dag gummit   Who is he and what is he to you COL channel name VAL Alf	0

A real "Jazz Oddity" - Federica Zammarchi "Jazz Oddity"\, consists in eleven re-arrangements of songs of David Bowie. Its concept came up a few years ago\, when she needed to mix together her two main musical loves\, namely jazz and 70's rock\, both so important during her forming years. It was recorded with an Italian all- star band and it showcases a uniquely innovative sound\, slightly influenced by european bands like the Esbjörn Svensson Trio\, coining a new genre definition called "PowerJazz".

COL title VAL Come On\, Let's Go COL performer VAL Tommy Steele	COL video title VAL Mister Magic - Grover Washington\, Jr. (1974) COL description VAL "Mister Magic" was the successful single and title track from the fifth album of one of jazz music's more well-known figures.  Grover Washington\, Jr. (December 12\, 1943 -- December 17\, 1999) was an American jazz-funk / soul-jazz saxophonist.  Along with George Benson\, John Klemmer\, David Sanborn\, Bob James\, Chuck Mangione\, Herb Alpert\, and Spyro Gyra\, he is considered by many to be one of the founders of the smooth jazz genre.  He wrote some of his material and later became an arranger and producer.  Washington was born in Buffalo\, New York on December 12\, 1943.  His mother was a church chorister\, and his father was a collector of old jazz gramophone records and a saxophonist as well\, so music was everywhere in the home.  He grew up with the great jazzmen and big band leaders like Benny Goodman\, Fletcher Henderson\, and others like them.  At the age of 8\, with the desire for him to be more than he could be\, Grover Sr. gave Jr. a saxophone.  He practiced and would sneak into clubs to see famous Buffalo blues musicians.  Washington left Buffalo and played with a Midwest group called the Four Clefs.  He was drafted into the U.S. Army shortly thereafter\, but this was to be to his advantage\, as he met drummer Billy Cobham there.  Cobham\, a mainstay in New York City\, introduced Washington to many New York musicians.  After leaving the Army\, Washington freelanced his talents around New York City\, eventually landing in Philadelphia in 1967.  In 1970 and 1971\, he appeared on Leon Spencer's first two albums on Prestige Records\, together with Idris Muhammad and Melvin Sparks.  Washington's big break came at the expense of another artist.  Alto sax man Hank Crawford was unable to make a recording date with Creed Taylor's Kudu Records\, and Washington took his place\, even though he was a backup.  This led to his first solo album\, "Inner City Blues".  He was talented and displayed heart and soul with soprano\, alto\, tenor\, and baritone saxophones.  Refreshing for his time\, he made headway into the jazz mainstream.  His fifth album\, 1974's "Mister Magic"\, was a commercial success\, and introduced guitarist Eric Gale as a near-permanent member in Washington's arsenal.  Throughout the 1970s and 1980s\, Washington made some of the genre's most memorable hits\, including "Mr. Magic" and "Black Frost.  In addition\, he performed very frequently with other artists\, including Bill Withers on "Just The Two Of Us" (still in regular rotation on radio today)\, Patti LaBelle on "The Best Is Yet To Come" and Phyllis Hyman on "A Sacred Kind Of Love".  He is also remembered for his take on the Dave Brubeck classic "Take Five"\, and for his 1996 version of "Soulful Strut".  On December 17\, 1999\, while waiting in the green room after taping four songs for "The Saturday Early Show" at CBS Studios in New York City\, Washington collapsed.  He was taken to St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital\, where he was pronounced dead at about 7:30 p.m.  He was 56 years old.  His doctors determined that he had suffered a massive heart attack.

Que j'me démène ou qu'je reste coi Je passe pour un je-ne-sais-quoi  Je ne fais pourtant de tort à  personne En suivant mon chemin de petit bonhomme. Mais les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Non les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Tout le monde médit de moi\, Sauf les muets\, ça va de soi.  Le jour du Quatorze Juillet Je reste dans mon lit douillet. La musique qui marche au pas\, Cela ne me regarde pas.  Je ne fais pourtant de tort à  personne\, En n'écoutant pas le clairon qui sonne. Mais les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Non les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Tout le monde me montre du doigt Sauf les manchots\, ça va de soi.  Quand j'croise un voleur malchanceux\, Poursuivi par un cul-terreux; J'lance la patte et pourquoi le taire\, Le cul-terreux s'retrouve par terre  Je ne fais pourtant de tort à  personne\, En laissant courir les voleurs de pommes. Mais les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Non les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Tout le monde se rue sur moi\, Sauf les culs-de-jatte\, ça va de soi.  Pas besoin d'être Jérémie\, Pour d'viner l'sort qui m'est promis\, S'ils trouvent une corde à  leur goût\, Ils me la passeront au cou\,  Je ne fais pourtant de tort à  personne\, En suivant les ch'mins qui n'mènent pas à  Rome\, Mais les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Non les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Tout l'mond' viendra me voir pendu\, Sauf les aveugles\, bien entendu.

This was recorded as part of the Sue Keller seminar presentation on "Women and the Blues".  The piece is a composition by Ida Cox from the early 20's titled\, "Wild Women Don't Have The Blues".  The presentation covered the following early blues women: Mamie Smith\, Bessie Smith\, Ma Rainey\, Lucille Hegamin\, Ida Cox\, Alberta Hunter and their influences on Ella May Morse\, Billie Holiday\, Etta James\, Patsy Cline\, Marcia Ball\, and Aretha Franklin.  The reference at the end is to how Sue used to play this as a rock tune with the Jeanne French Band in Boston back in the 70's... Jeanne's in Singapore now but her version is track #4 on her Mean Man Blues album available on buy.com.  Lyle Lovett also does a very nice version\, but uses lyrics modified by Francine Reed.

Purchase from the label: http://www.paradiseofbachelors.com/shop/pob-21 Purchase from Bandcamp: https://paradiseofbachelors.bandcamp.com/album/ambsace Other options: http://lnk.to/PoB21  The second album of astonishing duets by guitarists James Elkington (who has toured and/or recorded with Jeff Tweedy\, Richard Thompson\, and Steve Gunn\, among others) and Nathan Salsburg (an accomplished soloist deemed by NPR “one of those names we’ll all associate with American folk guitar”) is a sublime suite of nimble\, filigreed compositions by two singular stylists. Belying its title—“ambsace” is the lowest throw of dice; snake eyes—the record thrives on a gentle empathy and generosity of spirit\, sitting sneakily protean original compositions alongside gorgeous arrangements of songs by Duke Ellington and The Smiths at the same big hand-hewn table.

COL title VAL Pride and Joy COL performer VAL The Charlie Daniels Band	COL video title VAL Mister Magic - Grover Washington\, Jr. (1974) COL description VAL "Mister Magic" was the successful single and title track from the fifth album of one of jazz music's more well-known figures.  Grover Washington\, Jr. (December 12\, 1943 -- December 17\, 1999) was an American jazz-funk / soul-jazz saxophonist.  Along with George Benson\, John Klemmer\, David Sanborn\, Bob James\, Chuck Mangione\, Herb Alpert\, and Spyro Gyra\, he is considered by many to be one of the founders of the smooth jazz genre.  He wrote some of his material and later became an arranger and producer.  Washington was born in Buffalo\, New York on December 12\, 1943.  His mother was a church chorister\, and his father was a collector of old jazz gramophone records and a saxophonist as well\, so music was everywhere in the home.  He grew up with the great jazzmen and big band leaders like Benny Goodman\, Fletcher Henderson\, and others like them.  At the age of 8\, with the desire for him to be more than he could be\, Grover Sr. gave Jr. a saxophone.  He practiced and would sneak into clubs to see famous Buffalo blues musicians.  Washington left Buffalo and played with a Midwest group called the Four Clefs.  He was drafted into the U.S. Army shortly thereafter\, but this was to be to his advantage\, as he met drummer Billy Cobham there.  Cobham\, a mainstay in New York City\, introduced Washington to many New York musicians.  After leaving the Army\, Washington freelanced his talents around New York City\, eventually landing in Philadelphia in 1967.  In 1970 and 1971\, he appeared on Leon Spencer's first two albums on Prestige Records\, together with Idris Muhammad and Melvin Sparks.  Washington's big break came at the expense of another artist.  Alto sax man Hank Crawford was unable to make a recording date with Creed Taylor's Kudu Records\, and Washington took his place\, even though he was a backup.  This led to his first solo album\, "Inner City Blues".  He was talented and displayed heart and soul with soprano\, alto\, tenor\, and baritone saxophones.  Refreshing for his time\, he made headway into the jazz mainstream.  His fifth album\, 1974's "Mister Magic"\, was a commercial success\, and introduced guitarist Eric Gale as a near-permanent member in Washington's arsenal.  Throughout the 1970s and 1980s\, Washington made some of the genre's most memorable hits\, including "Mr. Magic" and "Black Frost.  In addition\, he performed very frequently with other artists\, including Bill Withers on "Just The Two Of Us" (still in regular rotation on radio today)\, Patti LaBelle on "The Best Is Yet To Come" and Phyllis Hyman on "A Sacred Kind Of Love".  He is also remembered for his take on the Dave Brubeck classic "Take Five"\, and for his 1996 version of "Soulful Strut".  On December 17\, 1999\, while waiting in the green room after taping four songs for "The Saturday Early Show" at CBS Studios in New York City\, Washington collapsed.  He was taken to St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital\, where he was pronounced dead at about 7:30 p.m.  He was 56 years old.  His doctors determined that he had suffered a massive heart attack.

Cale)  Arranged By -- Bill Boatman\, J.J. Cale Drums -- Jimmy Karstein Guitar -- J.J. Cale Keyboards -- Leon Russell Producer -- J.J. Cale\, Snuff Garrett  This was a Snuff Garrett project as a compilation album of covers of numbers that were popular on Hollywood's Sunset Strip. These were combined with newly-written numbers by J.J. Cale who was a member of the makeshift group assembled for the recording\, who called themselves "The Leathercoated Minds".  ------------------------  "Along Comes Mary" is a song composed by Tandyn Almer\, originally recorded in 1966 by American sunshine pop band the Association. It was the group's first hit\, released on their debut album\, And Then... Along Comes the Association (1966).  Background  "Along Comes Mary" is sung from the point of view of a once-disillusioned young man talking about the "tribulations no one ever sees" and who "curse[s] those faults in me." The singer believes Mary gives him comfort and improves his life. An acquaintance of Almer claimed in an interview that "Mary" refers to marijuana\, though it is unclear if Almer ever confirmed this. In the Young People's Concert titled What Is a Mode? Leonard Bernstein explained that the song was composed in the Dorian mode.  Bloodhound Gang version  American rock band Bloodhound Gang recorded a version of "Along Comes Mary" with new punk music to accompany the lyrics. It first appeared on the 1998 soundtrack to the film Half Baked before appearing on Bloodhound Gang's third studio album\, Hooray for Boobies\, the following year. "Along Comes Mary" was released as the album's first single in May 1999 and reached No. 5 in Austria\, No. 6 in Germany\, and No. 13 in Switzerland. The song was certified gold in both Austria and Germany.  Other covers  In 1966\, Hugh Masekela included the song on his album Hugh Masekela's Next Album\, and in 1967\, Cal Tjader covered it for his album Along Comes Cal. That same year\, Baja Marimba Band's had a minor hit with their cover of the song.  In 1968\, George Benson included a version on his album Giblet Gravy\, and in 1986 a cover appeared on R. Stevie Moore's album Glad Music.  In 1995\, the Manhattan Transfer covered the song for their album Tonin'\, and the following year\, 24-7 Spyz covered it for their album 6.  In 2005\, a cover of the song appeared on the Guess Who's compilation album Let's Go\, and Plainsong also released a cover on their self-titled album.  ------------------------  Lyrics  Every time I think that I'm the only one who's lonely someone calls on me. And every now and then I spend my time in rhyme and verse and curse those faults in me.  And then along comes Mary And does she want to give me kicks\, and be my steady chick and give me pick of memories Or maybe rather gather tales of all the fails and tribulations no one ever sees.  When we met I was sure out to lunch Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch.  When vague desire is the fire in the eyes of chicks whose sickness is the games they play. And when the masquerade is played and neighbor folks make jokes as who is most to blame today.  And then along comes Mary And does she want to set them free\, and let them see reality from where she got her name. And will they struggle much when told that such a tender touch as hers will make them not the same.  When we met I was sure out to lunch Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch\, sweet as the punch\, sweet as the punch\, sweet as the punch\, sweet as the punch.

COL title VAL Survivor COL performer VAL Destiny's Child	COL video title VAL Jamey Ryan ~ Willie and Laura Mae Jones (1969) [LIVE] COL description VAL From the August 14\, 1969 episode of the "Del Reeves Country Carnival".  About Jamey: Jamey Ryan is an American Country Music singer\, born in Texas in 1947.  A cousin of singer Goldie Hill\, and Songwriter/Producer Tommy Hill\, Jamey came to Nashville in her teens to launch a singing career. She started out recording demos for the writers at Starday Records\, where she met Charlie Dick\, Patsy Cline's Widower\, who was National Director of Promotion for the label. Jamey and Charlie were married in 1965\, and she gave birth to their son "Chip" the following year.  Jamey signed with Columbia Records and recorded 3 singles for the label\, scoring a minor hit with "You're Lookin' For A Plaything" in 1967. Without further success\, she left Columbia and signed to ShowBiz Records\, the fledgling music operation of ShowBiz Inc. ShowBiz was the production company behind many of the major Country Music TV shows of the day\, including "The Porter Wagoner Show" and "The Wilburn Brothers Show." Jamey also signed on as the featured female performer for ShowBiz's "Del Reeves Country Carnival" TV program.  Jamey recorded a number of singles for the ShowBiz label\, having a minor chart hit in 1969 with her cover of the Allen Toussaint song "Holy Cow." She remained with the label\, and "Del Reeves Country Carnival" until 1972 (the same year she and Charlie Dick divorced).  Jamey signed with the Country division of Atlantic Records\, and recorded a few sides with Producer Pete Drake\, scoring her third and final chart entry with "Keep On Loving Me" in 1973. Jamey recorded for a couple of small labels in the late '70's\, but eventually stopped recording and touring\, and went to work behind the scenes in the music business.  In a twist of irony\, many people hear striking similarities between Jamey's vocals and those of Patsy Cline. So much so that\, in 1984\, legendary Producer Owen Bradley asked Jamey to provide vocals for two recordings to be used in the movie "Sweet Dreams" about Patsy's life. In 1991\, Jamey also recorded Patsy's "I Fall To Pieces" for use in a TV Commercial about the Mazda RX7 sports car.  Today\, Jamey is a devoted wife\, mother and grandmother. She and Charlie Dick remain good friends\, and she is especially close to Patsy and Charlie's children\, Julie and Randy\, and their families. COL channel name VAL Down On Music Row	0
COL title VAL Mrs. Brown\, You've Got a Lovely Daughter COL performer VAL Larry Roquemore	COL video title VAL Mrs Brown You've Got A Lovely Daughter - Tom Courtenay (original version\, 1963) COL description VAL "Mrs Brown You've Got A Lovely Daughter" was a #1 hit on the US pop charts for Herman's Hermits in 1965. The original version of the song\, however\, had actually been by actor Tom Courtenay two years earlier\, in a British TV play entitled 'The Lads'.  As photographs from 'The Lads' are somewhat hard to come by (I'm not even sure the play still exists)\, the visuals here come from a Tom Courtenay film -- one of my all-time favorites\, as it happens -- the classic Billy Liar.

COL title VAL Dis Here COL performer VAL Jake Langley	COL video title VAL The Crazy World of Arthur Brown-Fire  (1968) COL description VAL "Fire" is a 1968 song by Arthur Brown\, Vincent Crane\, Mike Finesilver and Peter Ker. Performed by the Crazy World of Arthur Brown\, it was released as a single and on the band's debut album\, also called The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. The single made #1 in the UK (in August 1968) and Canada. In October\, it made #2 in the US Billboard charts and #19 in Australia. It also made number 6 in The Netherlands.  The song is an example of the psychedelic rock of the period\, though its lack of guitars distinguished it from many of its contemporaries. The lead instrument in this case was Vincent Crane's Hammond electronic organ\, augmented by an orchestral section featuring prominent brass. The singer's opening proclamation of himself as "the god of hellfire" became a lasting epithet.  *i posted this video only for entertainment purposes* COL channel name VAL elodd90	0

It was released on their debut album A Flock of Seagulls in 1982 and was its most successful single\, reaching number 9 in the United States and number 1 in Australia.  Single  The single was promoted by a distinctive music video in which the band members performed in a room covered in aluminum foil and mirrors. The cameras used to film the video are clearly visible in many of the background reflections\, their stands also covered in foil. The video is a homage to Brian Eno and Robert Fripp's (No Pussyfooting) album cover\, which was also respectively portrayed by The Strokes for their single\, "The End Has No End" two decades later. The video received heavy rotation on MTV in the summer of 1982\, and helped the single to become a hit. The video features a different edit of "I Ran" than the album version; the introduction was greatly shortened.  The band toured the United States extensively to promote the single\, supporting Squeeze on their 1982 tour. As well as reaching #9 on the Billboard Hot 100\, "I Ran" peaked at #3 on the Mainstream Rock chart and #8 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. Subsequently the album reached number 10 on the Billboard 200.  Despite success in the States and Australia\, the single did not enjoy similar success in the band's home country (United Kingdom)\, failing to make the top 40.  In an interview on the VH1 special 100 Greatest Songs of the '80s\, Mike Score said that he resents the song\, but plays it live because people enjoy it. "I Ran" was listed at #55 on the countdown. In VH1's 100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders of the 80s\, the song was listed at #2\, with Mike Score's interview played again.  Although considered an '80s New Wave classic\, the song experienced somewhat of a revival in 2002 as the signature theme for the video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City; being played during the game's television commercials and during gameplay as one of the songs in the playlist for radio station Wave 103.  Along with the Bowling for Soup cover\, it was also used as the theme song for the English dub of the anime series Knights of the Zodiac which was later removed from the air during its first season.  The song briefly featured in the Dead Zone Season 2 episode 'Playing God'\, heard during a party scene. It can also be heard during a nightclub scene in the 2005 Nick Love film The Business.  The master recording is available as a playable song in Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s as well as the rebooted version of Karaoke Revolution. The song was from the TV show Everybody Hates Chris entitled Everybody Hates the Last Day  It was performed by the Ska Rangers in the film The Hangover: Part II during the closing scene.  Also\, Fez sung a verse in That 70's Show during one of the "Circles" in the fourth season's opener.  Cover versions  "I Ran" has been covered by a number of artists:  Tori Amos covered the song on her Original Sinsuality/Summer Of Sin Tour in Denver\, during Piano Bar Time. Her version was released with the rest of the show in the 3rd CD of The Original Bootlegs.  Assemblage 23 recorded the song for the 1997 compilation Newer Wave.  Cranial Screwtop recorded a version of the song for their 2006 album "Too Fast for Technology".  Terminal Choice's cover of the song is included on the bonus disk of their 2006 album New Born Enemies.  Bowling for Soup covered the song for the 2003 re-release of their album Drunk Enough to Dance and their "Punk Rock 101" single. Both the original and the punk cover are the theme song of the American version of Saint Seiya\, also known as Knights of the Zodiac.  Hidden in Plain View recorded the song on the covers compilation album Punk Goes 80s.  In Dance Dance Revolution: Hottest Party 2\, Spacebar vs Naughty G covered this song.  Darude and Blake Lewis released a cover in 2008.  Nickelback covered the song during their Dark Horse Tour in 2010. It was sung by guitarist/vocalist Ryan Peake.  Slim Thug also took the bass line of this song to produce his single "I Run"  Umphrey's Mcgee covered the song during a performance at the Birmingham Southern College on 4/9/05\, however they have played it many times before.  Ska Rangers covered the song which featured on the film and soundtrack of The Hangover: Part II. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

COL title VAL Sugaree COL performer VAL Hank Ballard and The Midnighters	COL video title VAL Eric Benet & Faith Evans ~ Georgy Porgy "1999"  R&B  Rock COL description VAL A version by US soul band Charme was released in 1979 featuring an uncredited vocal by Luther Vandross. The single was re-released a few years later after the vocalist's rise in popularity and he was then credited as the featured artist. It remains a popular version in rare groove circles.  US disco/jazz-funk band Side Effect released their own version in 1980. It was on their "After The Rain" album. It made it to 77 in the US R&B charts.  In 1999\, a cover version by Eric Benét (with Faith Evans on background vocals) was released as the first single from Benét's album A Day in the Life. Their version reached number two in New Zealand.  MC Lyte used this song as the musical foundation of "Poor Georgie"\, from her 1991 album Act Like You Know. The song was used by Devin the Dude in his song "Georgy" from album "The Dude (Devin the Dude album)" and by Guru in "Kissed the World" from album "Jazzmatazz\, Vol. 4: The Hip-Hop Jazz Messenger: Back to the Future" also.  In 2002\, Japanese musician Ringo Sheena formed the band Yokoshima (邪) solely to play cover of Georgy Porgy.  In 2005\, guitarist Nils offered a rendition of this song from his popular Contemporary jazz radio Baja/TSR Records released album\, 'Pacific Coast Highway.'[4] Its also sampled on the remix of Joe's "All Or Nothing" single from his 1994 album of the same name called the Georgy Porgy remix.  In 2009 a rearranged instrumental rendition was also done by Japanese artist DJ Deckstream[5] on his Music Castle album.[6]   "Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976\, allowance is made for "fair use" for purposes such as criticism\, comment\, news reporting\, teaching\, scholarship\, and research.

Cale)  Arranged By -- Bill Boatman\, J.J. Cale Drums -- Jimmy Karstein Guitar -- J.J. Cale Keyboards -- Leon Russell Producer -- J.J. Cale\, Snuff Garrett  This was a Snuff Garrett project as a compilation album of covers of numbers that were popular on Hollywood's Sunset Strip. These were combined with newly-written numbers by J.J. Cale who was a member of the makeshift group assembled for the recording\, who called themselves "The Leathercoated Minds".  ------------------------  "Along Comes Mary" is a song composed by Tandyn Almer\, originally recorded in 1966 by American sunshine pop band the Association. It was the group's first hit\, released on their debut album\, And Then... Along Comes the Association (1966).  Background  "Along Comes Mary" is sung from the point of view of a once-disillusioned young man talking about the "tribulations no one ever sees" and who "curse[s] those faults in me." The singer believes Mary gives him comfort and improves his life. An acquaintance of Almer claimed in an interview that "Mary" refers to marijuana\, though it is unclear if Almer ever confirmed this. In the Young People's Concert titled What Is a Mode? Leonard Bernstein explained that the song was composed in the Dorian mode.  Bloodhound Gang version  American rock band Bloodhound Gang recorded a version of "Along Comes Mary" with new punk music to accompany the lyrics. It first appeared on the 1998 soundtrack to the film Half Baked before appearing on Bloodhound Gang's third studio album\, Hooray for Boobies\, the following year. "Along Comes Mary" was released as the album's first single in May 1999 and reached No. 5 in Austria\, No. 6 in Germany\, and No. 13 in Switzerland. The song was certified gold in both Austria and Germany.  Other covers  In 1966\, Hugh Masekela included the song on his album Hugh Masekela's Next Album\, and in 1967\, Cal Tjader covered it for his album Along Comes Cal. That same year\, Baja Marimba Band's had a minor hit with their cover of the song.  In 1968\, George Benson included a version on his album Giblet Gravy\, and in 1986 a cover appeared on R. Stevie Moore's album Glad Music.  In 1995\, the Manhattan Transfer covered the song for their album Tonin'\, and the following year\, 24-7 Spyz covered it for their album 6.  In 2005\, a cover of the song appeared on the Guess Who's compilation album Let's Go\, and Plainsong also released a cover on their self-titled album.  ------------------------  Lyrics  Every time I think that I'm the only one who's lonely someone calls on me. And every now and then I spend my time in rhyme and verse and curse those faults in me.  And then along comes Mary And does she want to give me kicks\, and be my steady chick and give me pick of memories Or maybe rather gather tales of all the fails and tribulations no one ever sees.  When we met I was sure out to lunch Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch.  When vague desire is the fire in the eyes of chicks whose sickness is the games they play. And when the masquerade is played and neighbor folks make jokes as who is most to blame today.  And then along comes Mary And does she want to set them free\, and let them see reality from where she got her name. And will they struggle much when told that such a tender touch as hers will make them not the same.  When we met I was sure out to lunch Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch\, sweet as the punch\, sweet as the punch\, sweet as the punch\, sweet as the punch.

COL title VAL The Soldier's Last Letter COL performer VAL Wanda Jackson	COL video title VAL Eddy Arnold -- I'm Thinking Tonight Of My Blue Eyes (VintageMusic.es) COL description VAL Eddy Arnold\, nacido el 15 de mayo de 1918 en la localidad de Henderson\, condado de Chester\, Tennessee y fallecido el 8 de mayo de 2008 en Franklin\, condado de Williamson\, Tennessee debido a una enfermedad\, fue un músico estadounidense\, especialmente volcado a la música country\, cuyo verdadero nombre era Richard Edward Arnold. Entre su debut en el mundo de la música en 1945 y 1954\, Eddie logró 58 top ten consecutivos\, y nunca marcó menos de un top 40 durante sus 21 años de carrera\, con más de 140 discos diferentes de los cuales se vendieron más de 85 millones de copias\, incluidos eternos clásicos como Bouquet de Rosas o Anytime. Recibió el apodo de Tennessee Plowboy (el chico del arado de Tennessee en inglés)\, y firmó contratos con las compañías discográficas RCA Records y MGM Records.  Richard Edward Arnold nació en Henderson\, en el condado de Chester\, estado de Tennessee\, el 15 de mayo de 1918 y se educó en el medio rural. Su padre era un violinista que alentó a su hijo respecto del desarrollo de sus talentos musicales y logró reunir el dinero suficiente para comprar a su niño una guitarra a la edad de 10 años. Para cuando entró en la escuela secundaria Eddie Arnols ya era toda una estrella local\, pero con la llegada de la Gran Depresión en 1929 y la crisis económica de los años 1930\, Eddy tuvo que dejar la escuela para ayudar trabajar como asistente en una funeraria. Relegó sus actuaciones musicales a funciones locales\, aunque de vez en cuando viajaba montado en una mula con su guitarra a la espalda.  Al igual que otros artistas del country de la época\, Eddy consiguió su pase al estrellato con sus apariciones en vivo por la radio\, antes de debutar en Jackson\, en Tennessee\, en 1936 y posteriormente en San Luis\, en el estado de Misuri.  Entre 1940 y 1943 apareció en el Grand Ole Opry junto a Pee Wee King. Apodado como el chico del arado de Tennessee (o Tennessee Plowboy\, en inglés) firmó con la RCA Victor Records un contrato en 1944 con ese nombre\, que fue el que apareció en sus discos hasta 1954. Con el tema Every hour Seems A Million Years alcanzó el quinto disco de su carrera\, dando con dicho disco comienzo a la cadena de 58 consecutivos éxitos top ten. En 1947 Arnold logró sus tres primeros éxitos número uno\, siendo uno de ellos número uno durante 21 semanas. Eddy Arnold realizó temas universalmente populares convirtiéndose en una estrella perenne\, grabando discos durante un período de cinco décadas\, desde los años 1960 hasta los años 1980; tras una pausa de siete años incluso regresó al estudio en 1990.  Además de establecer un nivel inigualable dada su avanzada edad\, Arnold se convirtió en un ejemplo de cómo manejar su fortuna en el mundo del espectáculo. "Guardo mi primer dólar y sigo ahorrando e invirtiendo mi dinero"\, recuerda\, "nunca olvidé cómo se sentía ser pobre"\, añadió. Eddie Anold se convirtió en uno de los hombres más ricos de la industria mediante la inversión en la única cosa que él consideraba de valor de propiedad\, "la tierra". Debido a su enorme popularidad musical Eddy Arnold se convirtió en un auténtico embajador de la música country a nivel mundial   Spotify:http://open.spotify.com/album/4tQOsxLgCwxPCRNS5LeWxN iTunes:http://itunes.apple.com/es/album/vintage-country-no-11-ep-all/id374306958 Síguenos en: Spotify: https://goo.gl/raouHQ Facebook: https://goo.gl/L92BHL Instagram: https://goo.gl/3oYDGH Web: http://www.vintagemusic.es   Compra nuestros Cd's en formato físico en estas plataformas: Ebay:  http://stores.ebay.com/VintageMusicFm BoutiqAlia: www.boutiqalia-vintagemusic.com Discogs: https://www.discogs.com/es/seller/vintagemusicfm/profile COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm	0

By the 1970s\, Haggard was aligned with the growing outlaw country movement\, and has continued to release successful albums through the 1990s and into the 2000s.

COL title VAL Snap Your Fingers COL performer VAL Joe Henderson [2]	COL video title VAL The California Ramblers - "My Honey's Lovin Arms" COL description VAL The California Ramblers ~ 1921-23  hi-def recording  Frank Cush - violin / director Bill Moore – trumpet Lloyd “Ole” Olsen – trombone Jimmy Duff – clarinet / alto sax Freddy Cusick – tenor sax Adrian Rollini – bass sax / xylophone Ed Sutton\, Joe LaFarro\, Sid Harris\, violin Irving Broadsky – piano Ray Kitchingman – banjo Fred Henry – drums     The California Ramblers were to become one of the most prolifically recorded society bands of the early 20th century; its sound styled after that of the Red Nichols variety and led mostly by Frank Cush (violin).      Between 1921 and 1935 many musicians joined and left the California Ramblers including the famous Dorsey Brothers and the very eccentric\, Jack Purvis (trombone and trumpet)\, who is said to have trashed and burned hotel rooms\, flown as a soldier of fortune\, played 52nd St.\, scored music for full orchestra\, and eventually led a prison band. Other members included Adrian Rollini (bass sax and xylophone)\, Fud Livingston and Bobby Davis (saxophones)\, and Chelsea Quealey.     During the 1920s the band was so in demand that they purchased a hotel on Pelham Parkway in the Bronx where they lived\, practiced\, and performed\, and dubbed it the Ramblers Inn. They went on to play some of the greatest clubs in New York City including the Rainbow Room at the top of the Rockefeller Center.     The original recordings made here were all “acoustical” 78s and interestingly\, recorded prior to the introduction of the microphone in 1925.     Although the music has been all but lost in our modern society\, it is my hope that these remastered jewels plucked from of our early American traditions will now live on into the 21st century and beyond.

COL title VAL Too Tired COL performer VAL Etta James	COL video title VAL Jo Vally - Geluk Kan Komen En Gaan COL description VAL Download 'Geluk Kan Komen En Gaan' op iTunes: http://smarturl.it/GelukKanKomenEnGaan  2013 was een topjaar voor Jo Vally. Zijn nieuwe album "Jo Vally Zingt Country" dat in Oktober verscheen bleek een schot in de roos en is inmiddels haast goed voor goud. Het nieuwe jaar is nog kersvers maar het bracht al meteen goed nieuws\, Jo heeft een MIA-nominatie op zak in de categorie Vlaams Populair! Het wordt nu spannend afwachten voor hem tot 8 februari wanneer de prijzen van de prestigieuze awards zullen worden uitgedeeld. Voor Jo zelf voelt de nominatie an sich al als een persoonlijke overwinning\, een bevestiging dat hij met zijn Countryplaat de juiste weg is ingeslagen.  Na Jo's vorige single 'Calypso' werd het stilaan tijd voor een nieuwe single uit het nieuwe album en dat wordt "Geluk Kan Komen En Gaan". Het nummer wordt hiermee  Jo's nieuwe voorjaarssingle en blijkt onder de fans van Jo Vally één van de topfavorieten te zijn\, het houdt dan ook mooi het midden tussen de countrystijl en het eigen repertoire van Jo.  En net zoals voor de vorige singles werd ook voor dit nummer de clip in Hollywood geshoot\, ditmaal vormt een verlaten cowboydorp het decor.

COL title VAL They're Red Hot COL performer VAL Peter Green Splinter Group with Nigel Watson	COL video title VAL MELINDA SCHNEIDER & BECCY COLE Queen of Hearts COL description VAL A Mother's Day tribute utilising the fabulous Australian country singers Melinda Schneider and Beccy Cole who are two of the nation's pre-eminent singers who came together to record an album of classic female country songs with the apt title 'Great Women of Country and the Songs that Made them'.  With very different vocal tones and style\, Beccy and Melinda do great justice to a generous amount of iconic tracks on their duet album. I chose this recording\, as the best known (although not the original) version by Juice Newton is pretty hard to top. but these two ladies give it a red hot go! I love the unique qualities they bring to this set\, and they seem to be having a great old time doing it\, as well. They filmed a very cute vid for their version of '9 to 5' - check it out - it gives people a sense of the performers and their great approach. Melinda is the daughter of yodelling superstar Mary Schneider\, and Beccy's mum Carole Sturtzel was regarded as the Queen of Country Music in South Australia. For me it is a lovely opportunity here to be able to post a clip of these two wonderful daughters and celebrate the terrific careers they have both carved out for themselves. Both have multiple Golden Guitar awards (Australia's Country Music Prizes) and have scored many hits from their already prolific catalogues.   Happy Mother's Day to all the wonderful Mums out there.

COL title VAL Willie and Laura Mae Jones COL performer VAL The Persuasions	COL video title VAL Jamey Ryan ~ Willie and Laura Mae Jones (1969) [LIVE] COL description VAL From the August 14\, 1969 episode of the "Del Reeves Country Carnival".  About Jamey: Jamey Ryan is an American Country Music singer\, born in Texas in 1947.  A cousin of singer Goldie Hill\, and Songwriter/Producer Tommy Hill\, Jamey came to Nashville in her teens to launch a singing career. She started out recording demos for the writers at Starday Records\, where she met Charlie Dick\, Patsy Cline's Widower\, who was National Director of Promotion for the label. Jamey and Charlie were married in 1965\, and she gave birth to their son "Chip" the following year.  Jamey signed with Columbia Records and recorded 3 singles for the label\, scoring a minor hit with "You're Lookin' For A Plaything" in 1967. Without further success\, she left Columbia and signed to ShowBiz Records\, the fledgling music operation of ShowBiz Inc. ShowBiz was the production company behind many of the major Country Music TV shows of the day\, including "The Porter Wagoner Show" and "The Wilburn Brothers Show." Jamey also signed on as the featured female performer for ShowBiz's "Del Reeves Country Carnival" TV program.  Jamey recorded a number of singles for the ShowBiz label\, having a minor chart hit in 1969 with her cover of the Allen Toussaint song "Holy Cow." She remained with the label\, and "Del Reeves Country Carnival" until 1972 (the same year she and Charlie Dick divorced).  Jamey signed with the Country division of Atlantic Records\, and recorded a few sides with Producer Pete Drake\, scoring her third and final chart entry with "Keep On Loving Me" in 1973. Jamey recorded for a couple of small labels in the late '70's\, but eventually stopped recording and touring\, and went to work behind the scenes in the music business.  In a twist of irony\, many people hear striking similarities between Jamey's vocals and those of Patsy Cline. So much so that\, in 1984\, legendary Producer Owen Bradley asked Jamey to provide vocals for two recordings to be used in the movie "Sweet Dreams" about Patsy's life. In 1991\, Jamey also recorded Patsy's "I Fall To Pieces" for use in a TV Commercial about the Mazda RX7 sports car.  Today\, Jamey is a devoted wife\, mother and grandmother.

He's underneath the window\, she's singing\, "Hey la\, my boyfriend's back. You shouldn't come around here singing up to people like that... Anyway\, what you gonna do about it?"

When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong\, Juliet?  Come up on different streets\, they're both the streets of shame. Both dirty\, both mean\, yes\, in the dream it was just the same And I dreamed your dream for you and now your dream is real. How can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals?  When you can fall for chains of silver\,  You can fall for chains of gold\, You can fall for pretty strangers  And the promises they hold.

I can't do the talk\, like the talk on TV And I can't do a love song\, like the way it's meant to be. I can't do everything\, but I'll do anything for you. I can't do anything\, 'cept be in love with you! And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be. All I do is keep the beat... and bad company. Now all I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme\, Juliet\, I'd do the stars with you any time!  Juliet\, when we made love you used to cry. You said\, "I love you like the stars above\, I'll love you 'til I die". There's a place for us\, you know the movie song. When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong\, Juliet?

Did you make it to the Milky Way To see the lights all faded And that heaven is overrated?  Tell me\, did you fall for a shooting star? One without a permanent scar And then you missed me While you were looking for yourself out there?   Now that she's back from that soul vacation Tracing her way through the constellation\, hey She checks out Mozart while she does Tae-Bo Reminds me that there's room to grow\, hey   Now that she's back in the atmosphere I'm afraid that she might think of me as Plain ol' Jane told a story about a man Who was too afraid to fly so he never did land   But tell me\, did the wind sweep you off your feet? Did you finally get the chance To dance along the light of day And head back to the Milky Way?  And tell me\, did Venus blow your mind? Was it everything you wanted to find? And then you missed me While you were looking for yourself out there   Can you imagine no love\, pride\, deep-fried chicken Your best friend always sticking up for you Even when I know you're wrong?  Can you imagine no first dance\, freeze-dried romance Five-hour phone conversation The best soy latte that you ever had\, and me?   But tell me\, did the wind sweep you off your feet? Did you finally get the chance To dance along the light of day And head back toward the Milky Way?   But tell me\, did you sail across the sun? Did you make it to the Milky Way To see the lights all faded And that heaven is overrated?  And tell me\, did you fall for a shooting star?

Cale)  Arranged By -- Bill Boatman\, J.J. Cale Drums -- Jimmy Karstein Guitar -- J.J. Cale Keyboards -- Leon Russell Producer -- J.J. Cale\, Snuff Garrett  This was a Snuff Garrett project as a compilation album of covers of numbers that were popular on Hollywood's Sunset Strip. These were combined with newly-written numbers by J.J. Cale who was a member of the makeshift group assembled for the recording\, who called themselves "The Leathercoated Minds".  ------------------------  "Along Comes Mary" is a song composed by Tandyn Almer\, originally recorded in 1966 by American sunshine pop band the Association. It was the group's first hit\, released on their debut album\, And Then... Along Comes the Association (1966).  Background  "Along Comes Mary" is sung from the point of view of a once-disillusioned young man talking about the "tribulations no one ever sees" and who "curse[s] those faults in me." The singer believes Mary gives him comfort and improves his life. An acquaintance of Almer claimed in an interview that "Mary" refers to marijuana\, though it is unclear if Almer ever confirmed this. In the Young People's Concert titled What Is a Mode? Leonard Bernstein explained that the song was composed in the Dorian mode.  Bloodhound Gang version  American rock band Bloodhound Gang recorded a version of "Along Comes Mary" with new punk music to accompany the lyrics. It first appeared on the 1998 soundtrack to the film Half Baked before appearing on Bloodhound Gang's third studio album\, Hooray for Boobies\, the following year. "Along Comes Mary" was released as the album's first single in May 1999 and reached No. 5 in Austria\, No. 6 in Germany\, and No. 13 in Switzerland. The song was certified gold in both Austria and Germany.  Other covers  In 1966\, Hugh Masekela included the song on his album Hugh Masekela's Next Album\, and in 1967\, Cal Tjader covered it for his album Along Comes Cal. That same year\, Baja Marimba Band's had a minor hit with their cover of the song.  In 1968\, George Benson included a version on his album Giblet Gravy\, and in 1986 a cover appeared on R. Stevie Moore's album Glad Music.  In 1995\, the Manhattan Transfer covered the song for their album Tonin'\, and the following year\, 24-7 Spyz covered it for their album 6.  In 2005\, a cover of the song appeared on the Guess Who's compilation album Let's Go\, and Plainsong also released a cover on their self-titled album.  ------------------------  Lyrics  Every time I think that I'm the only one who's lonely someone calls on me. And every now and then I spend my time in rhyme and verse and curse those faults in me.  And then along comes Mary And does she want to give me kicks\, and be my steady chick and give me pick of memories Or maybe rather gather tales of all the fails and tribulations no one ever sees.  When we met I was sure out to lunch Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch.  When vague desire is the fire in the eyes of chicks whose sickness is the games they play. And when the masquerade is played and neighbor folks make jokes as who is most to blame today.  And then along comes Mary And does she want to set them free\, and let them see reality from where she got her name. And will they struggle much when told that such a tender touch as hers will make them not the same.  When we met I was sure out to lunch Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch\, sweet as the punch\, sweet as the punch\, sweet as the punch\, sweet as the punch.

COL title VAL Rock and Roll Lullaby COL performer VAL Barbra Zinger	COL video title VAL Streets of Baltimore - Nanci Griffith and John Prine COL description VAL from her album\, "Other Voices\, Too - A Trip Back to Bountiful"\, released in 1998. This is Nanci's 15th album and she is joined with other artists. She considers this a follow up to her album\, "Other Voices\, Other Rooms" which was released in 1993. In this album her focus on songwriters is so much a part of the album's spirit. The writers whose songs Nanci has selected range from the well-known\, like British folk-pop artists Richard Thompson and Sandy Denny\, early American rocker Sonny Curtis\, American folksingers Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger and country legend Johnny Cash\, to lesser known writers like John Grimaudo\, Saylor White\, Ian Tyson and Texas songwriter Mickie Merkens\, to Stephen Foster\, perhaps the greatest American songwriter of the 19th century. "We started with several songs that spilled over from the last album\, like Richard Thompson's 'Wall Of Death' and Stephen Foster's 'Hard Times Come Again No More\,' then we went back to the list of songs I felt weren't sung enough".  At times\, we had so many people in the studio -- like when we had 37 for "Wasn't That A Mighty Storm" -- and they wouldn't leave! The beer was free\, the food was good\, everyone got to meet their heroes. It was just so exciting to bring people together.  quotes from Nanci Griffith found on the site homepages.sover.net/~rschrull/ngriffith/othertoo/othertoo.html  I do not own this song.

Banes Drums\, Percussion -- Jimmy Young  ------------------------  "Fire" is a 1968 song by Arthur Brown\, Vincent Crane\, Mike Finesilver and Peter Ker. Performed by The Crazy World of Arthur Brown\, it was released as a single and on the band's debut album\, also called The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. The single made #1 in the UK (in August 1968) and Canada. In October\, it made #2 in the US Billboard charts and #19 in Australia. It also made #6 in the Netherlands. "Fire" sold over one million copies\, and was awarded a gold disc.  The song is an example of the psychedelic rock of the period\, though its lack of guitars or bass guitar distinguished it from many of its contemporaries. The lead instrument in this case was Vincent Crane's Hammond electronic organ\, augmented by an orchestral section featuring prominent brass. The singer's opening proclamation of himself as "the god of hellfire" became a lasting epithet. The song's other memorable line is "You're Gonna Burn!!". The song ends with the sound of a wind from hell.  During live performances and in the black and white promotional television clip\, Brown performed the song wearing a burning helmet. The helmet was improvised with a leather skull cap onto which was bolted a metal dish that held lighter fluid or petrol. As the cap was not insulated\, the heat from the burning fuel quickly conducted through the fixing bolt to the top of Brown's head\, causing him considerable pain.  Two studio mixes of "Fire" have been officially released\, one in stereo and one in mono. The mono mix features no brass. Both versions are included on the CD reissue of The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. The single B-side\, "Rest Cure"\, was another track from the album.  Credit for the composition of "Fire" on the original vinyl single was to Arthur Brown and Vincent Crane only; however\, Mike Finesilver and Peter Ker successfully sued for co-credit and royalties based on melodic similarities to their song "Baby\, You're a Long Way Behind".  The song is briefly featured in the films Hot Fuzz (2007) and The Boat That Rocked (2009). It is also referenced in Julie Hearn's debut novel Follow Me Down\, and was used in the episode "Burn Victim" of My Name Is Earl.  Cover versions  The Ventures covered the song on their 1969 album Underground Fire. Lizzy Mercier Descloux covered "Fire" on her album Press Color (1979)\, drastically changing the mood and style of the track. Pete Townshend\, the single's associate producer\, covered "Fire" as a member of The Who on his 1989 album The Iron Man: A Musical. Cirith Ungol covered the song on their 1991 album Paradise Lost. The Prodigy sampled the track for "Fire/Jericho"\, which was otherwise a completely different song\, on their 1992 album Experience. Emerson\, Lake & Palmer covered the song on their 1993 4-disc compilation album The Return of the Manticore. German dark electro act AmGod covered the song several times. The most well-known version is "Fire v.2" featured on the 1994 album Half Rotten and Decayed. Though it was not a true 'cover'\, Marilyn Manson's "Lunchbox" (1995) heavily samples "Fire". UK doom metal band Cathedral covered the song on their 1996 EP Hopkins (The Witchfinder General). Die Krupps covered the song on their 1997 album Paradise Now. Dutch death metal band God Dethroned covered the song on their 1997 album The Grand Grimoire. Ozzy Osbourne included a version on his 2005 album Under Cover. The song is used in one episode of Series 3 of Monkey Dust (2005) as the Paedofinder General burns the wrongly accused paedophiles with this music in the background\, complete with bastardised lyrics. US Hip hop duo Cunninlynguists sampled the song for "Hellfire" on their 2006 album A Piece of Strange. Leningrad Cowboys covered the song in a metal style and included it on their 2006 album Zombie's Paradise. Appears in the musical Disco Inferno\, when the character Duke reveals himself to be Satan in disguise.[citation needed] Death Grips\, an experimental hip hop group backed by drummer Zach Hill\, sampled "Fire" in their song "Lord of the Game".

I'm still not sure what to make of same sex marriage. I am a stout conservative however I believe that people should be free to share their lives with whom they wish or fall in love with regardless of sexual barriers and live it as they see fit as long as harm is not brought to others\, judgments I leave to God\, that is regarding that my rights are not encroached upon by the rights of others.  This being said I do believe that if not marriage as defined between a men and a woman there should be similar laws that protect and gives the proper rights to any two persons who form a serious home and a relationship together.  I do have friends who are in such relationships\, I do not condone discrimination based on sexual preferences and to them I dedicate this record by the great Charles Aznavour\,  it tells a touching and very lonely story.

Mastered at Project One Mastering.  ------------------------  "The One I Love" is a song by American rock band R.E.M.. It was released on the band's fifth full-length studio album\, Document\, and also as a 7" vinyl single in 1987. The song was their first hit single\, reaching #9 in the US Billboard Hot 100\, #14 in Canada\, and later reached #16 in the UK singles chart on its UK release (1991).  The song was included in Activision's Guitar Hero World Tour and is in Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades.  The accompanying video's director was artist Robert Longo.  The director of photography was Alton Brown\, who later became a Food Network chef.  In March 2005\, Q magazine placed "The One I Love" at number 57 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks.  The song is included on R.E.M. Live.  Lyrics and meaning  Many listeners who misunderstand the song's meaning have made the song a popular radio dedication to loved ones\, relying on the main lyric\, "This one goes out to the one I love."  However\, they missed an ensuing line: "A simple prop to occupy my time"; the song was not particularly a love song.  Stipe related in 1987 to Rolling Stone\, "I've always left myself pretty open to interpretation. It's probably better that they just think it's a love song at this point."  However\, in an interview in the January 1988 issue of Musician magazine he said that the song was "incredibly violent" and "It's very clear that it's about using people over and over again".  The song contains only three verses\, which are all near identical\, with small variations each repeat of the verse. (For example "A simple prop to occupy my time"\, "Another prop has occupied my time"). The chorus consists of just the word "fire"\, repeated (with the backing vocal of "She's coming down on her own now/Coming down on her own"\, sung by Mike Mills).  Cover versions  Bush Sufjan Stevens Massacre and many more. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

Finds a streetlight\, steps out of the shade Says something like\, "You and me babe\, how about it?"  Juliet says\, "Hey\, it's Romeo\, you nearly gave me a heart attack!" He's underneath the window\, she's singing\, "Hey la\, my boyfriend's back. You shouldn't come around here singing up to people like that... Anyway\, what you gonna do about it?"  ROMEO: Juliet\, the dice was loaded from the start And I bet when you exploded into my heart And I forget I forget the movie song. When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong\, Juliet?  Come up on different streets\, they're both the streets of shame. Both dirty\, both mean\, yes\, in the dream it was just the same And I dreamed your dream for you and now your dream is real. How can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals?  When you can fall for chains of silver\,  You can fall for chains of gold\, You can fall for pretty strangers  And the promises they hold. You promised me everything\, you promised me thick and thin\, yeah! Now you just say\, "Oh Romeo? Yeah\, you know I used to have a scene with him".  Juliet\, when we made love\, you used to cry. You said\, "I love you like the stars above\, I'll love you 'til I die". There's a place for us\, you know the movie song. When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong\, Juliet?  I can't do the talk\, like the talk on TV And I can't do a love song\, like the way it's meant to be. I can't do everything\, but I'll do anything for you. I can't do anything\, 'cept be in love with you! And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be. All I do is keep the beat... and bad company. Now all I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme\, Juliet\, I'd do the stars with you any time!  Juliet\, when we made love you used to cry. You said\, "I love you like the stars above\, I'll love you 'til I die". There's a place for us\, you know the movie song. When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong\, Juliet?

COL title VAL American Patrol COL performer VAL Glenn Miller and His Orchestra	COL video title VAL Mister Magic - Grover Washington\, Jr. (1974) COL description VAL "Mister Magic" was the successful single and title track from the fifth album of one of jazz music's more well-known figures.  Grover Washington\, Jr. (December 12\, 1943 -- December 17\, 1999) was an American jazz-funk / soul-jazz saxophonist.  Along with George Benson\, John Klemmer\, David Sanborn\, Bob James\, Chuck Mangione\, Herb Alpert\, and Spyro Gyra\, he is considered by many to be one of the founders of the smooth jazz genre.  He wrote some of his material and later became an arranger and producer.  Washington was born in Buffalo\, New York on December 12\, 1943.  His mother was a church chorister\, and his father was a collector of old jazz gramophone records and a saxophonist as well\, so music was everywhere in the home.  He grew up with the great jazzmen and big band leaders like Benny Goodman\, Fletcher Henderson\, and others like them.  At the age of 8\, with the desire for him to be more than he could be\, Grover Sr. gave Jr. a saxophone.  He practiced and would sneak into clubs to see famous Buffalo blues musicians.  Washington left Buffalo and played with a Midwest group called the Four Clefs.  He was drafted into the U.S. Army shortly thereafter\, but this was to be to his advantage\, as he met drummer Billy Cobham there.  Cobham\, a mainstay in New York City\, introduced Washington to many New York musicians.  After leaving the Army\, Washington freelanced his talents around New York City\, eventually landing in Philadelphia in 1967.  In 1970 and 1971\, he appeared on Leon Spencer's first two albums on Prestige Records\, together with Idris Muhammad and Melvin Sparks.  Washington's big break came at the expense of another artist.  Alto sax man Hank Crawford was unable to make a recording date with Creed Taylor's Kudu Records\, and Washington took his place\, even though he was a backup.  This led to his first solo album\, "Inner City Blues".  He was talented and displayed heart and soul with soprano\, alto\, tenor\, and baritone saxophones.  Refreshing for his time\, he made headway into the jazz mainstream.  His fifth album\, 1974's "Mister Magic"\, was a commercial success\, and introduced guitarist Eric Gale as a near-permanent member in Washington's arsenal.  Throughout the 1970s and 1980s\, Washington made some of the genre's most memorable hits\, including "Mr. Magic" and "Black Frost.  In addition\, he performed very frequently with other artists\, including Bill Withers on "Just The Two Of Us" (still in regular rotation on radio today)\, Patti LaBelle on "The Best Is Yet To Come" and Phyllis Hyman on "A Sacred Kind Of Love".  He is also remembered for his take on the Dave Brubeck classic "Take Five"\, and for his 1996 version of "Soulful Strut".  On December 17\, 1999\, while waiting in the green room after taping four songs for "The Saturday Early Show" at CBS Studios in New York City\, Washington collapsed.  He was taken to St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital\, where he was pronounced dead at about 7:30 p.m.  He was 56 years old.  His doctors determined that he had suffered a massive heart attack.

COL title VAL Science Fiction Double Feature (Reprise) COL performer VAL The Ataris	COL video title VAL The Crazy World of Arthur Brown-Fire  (1968) COL description VAL "Fire" is a 1968 song by Arthur Brown\, Vincent Crane\, Mike Finesilver and Peter Ker. Performed by the Crazy World of Arthur Brown\, it was released as a single and on the band's debut album\, also called The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. The single made #1 in the UK (in August 1968) and Canada. In October\, it made #2 in the US Billboard charts and #19 in Australia. It also made number 6 in The Netherlands.  The song is an example of the psychedelic rock of the period\, though its lack of guitars distinguished it from many of its contemporaries. The lead instrument in this case was Vincent Crane's Hammond electronic organ\, augmented by an orchestral section featuring prominent brass. The singer's opening proclamation of himself as "the god of hellfire" became a lasting epithet.  *i posted this video only for entertainment purposes* COL channel name VAL elodd90	0

Que j'me démène ou qu'je reste coi Je passe pour un je-ne-sais-quoi  Je ne fais pourtant de tort à  personne En suivant mon chemin de petit bonhomme. Mais les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Non les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Tout le monde médit de moi\, Sauf les muets\, ça va de soi.  Le jour du Quatorze Juillet Je reste dans mon lit douillet. La musique qui marche au pas\, Cela ne me regarde pas.  Je ne fais pourtant de tort à  personne\, En n'écoutant pas le clairon qui sonne. Mais les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Non les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Tout le monde me montre du doigt Sauf les manchots\, ça va de soi.  Quand j'croise un voleur malchanceux\, Poursuivi par un cul-terreux; J'lance la patte et pourquoi le taire\, Le cul-terreux s'retrouve par terre  Je ne fais pourtant de tort à  personne\, En laissant courir les voleurs de pommes. Mais les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Non les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Tout le monde se rue sur moi\, Sauf les culs-de-jatte\, ça va de soi.  Pas besoin d'être Jérémie\, Pour d'viner l'sort qui m'est promis\, S'ils trouvent une corde à  leur goût\, Ils me la passeront au cou\,  Je ne fais pourtant de tort à  personne\, En suivant les ch'mins qui n'mènent pas à  Rome\, Mais les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Non les braves gens n'aiment pas que L'on suive une autre route qu'eux\, Tout l'mond' viendra me voir pendu\, Sauf les aveugles\, bien entendu.

Another Girl Another Planet is featured on The Coal Porters new album\, No. 6. No. 6\, is produced by John Wood\, the legendary British folk-rock mastermind who recorded the classic albums of Fairport Convention\, Nick Drake\, Beth Orton and Squeeze. No. 6 is a bit of a departure for the Coal Porters as it pushes their musical boundaries further than ever before.The Coal Porters - No. 6  https://thecoalporters.com / https://thecoalporters.bandcamp.com / https://www.facebook.com/thecoalporters  This new album features Kerenza quadruple tracking herself into a string quartet\, Andrew on a ukulele\, Sid on trusty autoharp and mandolin\, both Neil and Paul on dobro\, a Byrdsy acoustic 12-string guitar\, and very emotional\, long\, sweet trumpet solo by Cuba’s noted “son y mambo” music virtuoso Eikel Venegas. There has never been music like this before. And already\, the album’s opening track\, Sid’s “The Day The Last Ramone Died\,” is being hailed as a classic.  Recorded in two creative bursts in late 2014 and in 2015 this is the Coal Porters album which took three years to incubate. Four new Sid songs\, three new Neil Bob Herd originals\, and Kerenza Peacock contributed her first recorded lead vocal on a very personal song with Play A Tune while also gracing the record with a totally catchy instrumental\, Chopping The Garlic. The album goes out on a high note with the band’s warm-hearted cover of the Only Ones’ classic hit Another Girl\, Another Planet.  No.6 was released in September 2016 and can be ordered via Amazon\, iTunes\, the Sid Griffin website and in all good records stores.

COL title VAL Blues Run the Game COL performer VAL Johan Asherton	COL video title VAL DENI HINES & CHRISTINE ANU - TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS COL description VAL Two of Australias most loved and successful female recording artists\, Deni Hines and Christine Anu\, are takin it to the streets again in 2009 after the success of their 2008 East-Coast of Australia tour.    On the first tour we had such a great time\, that we wanted to do it all over again\, especially when we have such a great cause to promote such as the Salvation Army and Oasis Youth Support Network. We feel privileged to be able to help says Christine & Deni.    In a two hour show\, this sassy duo will perform their classic hits and favourite timeless songs along with some special duets\, including their own rendition of the Doobie Brothers hit TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS.   While promoting their 2008 tour\, Deni and Christine so happened to be performing one of their show duets TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS on the Today Show (Nine Network\, Australia). On the same show was a heartfelt segment about the plight of homelessness in Australia accompanied by Captain Paul Mould of the Salvation Armys Oasis Youth Support Network\, who take care and provide much needed services for the homeless and youth of Australia (who come from all walks of life.)  No less than 5 minutes after walking off set\, Christine and Deni turned to each other and said weve got to do something to help and the recording of TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS was set in motion.   Deni and Christine will release their version of TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS on 15 November 2008 (Nationwide) with fifty percent (50%) of profits going to the Salvation Armys Youth Homelessness Oasis Foundation and the Everyone Is Homeless Fund.  On Wednesday\, 17th December Christine and Deni will also stage a free Christmas concert version of their TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS show exclusively for the Salvation Armys Youth Homelessness Oasis Foundation and the homeless people of Sydney.   For further information on Salvation Armys Youth Homelessness Oasis Foundation and the Everyone Is Homeless Fund\, please refer to www.oasis.salvos.org.au  In the ABS Census 2001 (The 2006 Census data has not been finalized)\, there were 100\,000 homeless people (men\, women and children) across Australia\, one third (36\,173) are youth between 12-24 years of age.  Only 14.25% of homeless people were able to stay in services funded through SAAP (Supported Accommodation Assistance Program) jointly funded by both the Commonwealth and State Governments.  Christine and Deni would like to thank the following companies and people for donating their time and services free of charge of the purposes of this donation campaign drive -  301 Studios\, Sing Sing Studios\, David and Anthony @ DNA Songs\, Tony Espie\, David Walker at Stepford Audio\, John Adams\, Franco Raggatt\, Barbara Griffin\, Cameron Undy\, Michael Rohanek and Rob Thompson.

COL title VAL No Help Wanted COL performer VAL Bill Woods and His Orange Blossom Playboys with Hillbilly Barton	COL video title VAL Maddox Brothers & Rose - No Help Wanted COL description VAL The Maddox Brothers and Rose\, known as America's Most Colorful Hillbilly Band from the 1930s to the 1950s\, consisted of four brothers\, Fred\, Cal\, Cliff and Don Maddox\, along with their sister Rose. Cliff died in 1949 and was replaced by brother Henry. The group disbanded in 1956.  The family hailed from Boaz\, Alabama\, but rode the rails and hitch hiked to California in 1933 when the band members were still children\, following the failed efforts of their sharecropper parents during the early part of the Depression. They were a little in advance of the flood of Okies who were to flood the state in the 30s. They struggled to make a living as intinerant fruit and vegetable pickers following the harvest as far north as Washington state\, and as far east as Arizona\, as well as in the San Joaquin Valley. They often worked from dawn to dusk\, sleeping and eating on the ground.  Having settled in Modesto\, the family developed their musical ability and\, in 1937 performed on the radio\, sponsored by a local furniture store. In 1939 they entered a hillbilly band competition at the centenial Sacramento State Fair after driving to Sacramento in their Model A. When they took the stage they tore through "Sally Let Your Bangs Hang Down" with rocking rhythms and risque lyrics. They became\, officially\, California's best hillbilly band.  The brothers and Rose appeared at places such as the 97th Street Corral in Los Angles.  From 1946-1951 the group recorded for 4 Star Records (Hollywood)\, then for Columbia Records. Some 4 Star masters were leased and released by US.-Decca Records at the beginning of the 1950s. The following quotes are from Rose Maddox. "We were called hillbilly singers - not country - then. No\, none of this country music then. People just called us hillbilly... People tell me that I was one of the first women to sing what I sang - country boogie. I guess I was. There was no rock 'n' roll in those early days\, before 1955. Only country boogie. My brothers also played that way. We called it country then.  The Maddox's material ranged from the country standards of Hank Williams and Merle Travis\, cowboy songs\, to the Western swing of Bob Wills\, to old-time\, folk\, and church singing\, to jazz\, swing\, boogie woogie and even a taste of early rock and roll.  Fred Maddox played upright bass using the "slap bass" technique as early as 1937.[5] This trademark backbeat\, a slapping bass style\, helped drive a broad change in popular music\, sporting a faster\, immediately discernible rhythm that came to be known as rockabilly.  Fred Maddox's bass is displayed at the Experience Music Project in Seattle. "They wanted his bass because they believe he might have hit the first note of rock 'n' roll on it.

COL title VAL Dancing with Tears in My Eyes COL performer VAL Marina Celeste	COL video title VAL ELLIE POP - WHATCHA GONNA DO ABOUT IT.wmv COL description VAL ELLIE POP - 'Watcha Gonna Do 'Bout It' (Mainstream S-6115) 1968  Before I started collecting original 60s garage/psych 45s I spent decades buying (mostly) original and re-issue albums and one of my early purchases was this obscurity by Ellie Pop on Mainstream Records. This album is hard to find and commands a decent price tag but it was re-issued a few years ago and should now be available to a larger audience at last.  In my opinion Ellie Pop were treading their own path in 1968\, there's no fuzz\, no psych touches\, no 1968isms of heavy guitars and keyboards. What you get is a collection of beautifully constructed pop songs that suggest a big Anglophile influence\, in particular mid-60s period Beatles. They sound similar to say The Merry-Go-Round or The Left Banke but without the baroque touches. Just pure pop\, or should I say Ellie Pop.  Virtually every review I've read online or in Shindig for instance\, fails to mention that 'Whatcha Gonna Do 'Bout It' is a cover of a Hollies cut they recorded in 1963 for their debut album 'Stay With The Hollies.' Ellie Pop wrote all of their own tunes except this one!  I'm not certain where Ellie Pop hailed from or even the full names of the group members but it has been suggested elsewhere that they were from Detroit. Maybe someone can confirm this?  http://expo67-cavestones.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/ellie-pop-whatcha-gonna-do-bout-it.html COL channel name VAL ACID REVOLVER	0

'Classic Folk Music from Smithsonian Folkways Recordings' is available on CD and digital.  Stream/download/purchase: Smithsonian Folkways: https://folkways.si.edu/classic-folk-music-from-folkways-recordings/american-folk/music/album/smithsonian Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/album/3ZvJN4KO7r0ivacGwObKVt?si=XdZ6zndVS6SR_0xDGyfUag  We often take for granted the supremacy of artists such as Doc Watson\, Woody Guthrie\, Pete Seeger\, Lead Belly\, Big Bill Broonzy\, Brownie McGhee\, and other folk music legends. Classic Folk sheds new light on the success of the urban intellectual-driven movement that made rural white and African-American artists and their music favorites of audiences everywhere. This recording features classic performances by classic artists doing some of their classic songs during the great folksong revival of the 1940s through 1960s. It features some of the great performances from the vaults of Folkways Records. Compiled and annotated by Jeff Place.

COL title VAL Kiss an Angel Good Mornin' COL performer VAL David Dondero	COL video title VAL NYSF Threepenny Opera - 07 - Liebeslied (Look at the Moon over Soho) COL description VAL This is an LP transfer of the 1976 New York Shakespeare Festival's revival production of "The Threepenny Opera."  This recording should not be confused with the original 1954 New York production recording\, nor the 1994 Donmar Warehouse production recording in England.  Unlike Marc Blitzstein's version which ran during the 1950's for six years and featured the incomparable Lotte Lenya\, this translation is less sanitized and more in keeping with the seedy and sexual nature of the original german play.    From the liner notes to the album - "the successful Blitzstein version was an adaptation rather than a translation\, and in comparing it to the original\, we were surprised at the extent to which his treatment vitiated the political and sexual thrust which gives the work its relentless power.  Blitzstein sweetened and cleaned up Brecht's unsparing lyrics\, partially in deference to stage censorship...but in doing so he in many instances changed Brecht's meanings around entirely\, and throughout he softened the impact of Brecht's biting ferocity.  He also attempted to make the lyrics more 'singable' by fitting them into conventional musical patterns\, and in this he succeeded admirably."  The translation used for this revival was prepared by Ralph Maheim and John Willett; the full text can be found in their edition of Brecht's Collected Plays\, Volume 2.  A hardcover edition was also published in conjunction with the revival.  This revival was directed by conceptual theater artist Richard Foreman\, and starred Raul Julia and Ellen Greene\, both of whom were nominated for Tony Awards.  It was produced by Joseph Papp and the New York Shakespeare Festival at the Vivian Beaumont Theatre at Lincoln Center.  Additional information regarding the production\, including cast list\, can be found at the Internet Broadway Database's listing for this revival at http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=3835 ...  As of June 2007\, this cast album has not been released or reissued on CD; it was originally made available in 1976 on LP\, and this is an LP transfer.  As such\, the quality is not CD quality  - there will occasionally be noise\, popping\, or hissing.

Superb early release on the Green Zonophone Label\, probably in the late 1920s\, with the serial no 5465 of this highly popular song. originally written by Woolsey And Sauer When Its Springtime In The Rockies.  I am not sure if it is the first release\, but certanly is ether early or late 1920s\, 30's or maybe before that.  Difficult to tell as one of my complaints about these old 78s is unlike their successors\, they never put the date of release on them. COL channel name VAL Sliepnir2006	0

Both songs were originally sung by Ben E. King and made the R&B top 20\, and "I'll Be There" also reached number 12 on the pop chart. In 1962 she recorded "Dance With a Dolly (With a Hole in her Stocking)"\, previously made famous by The Andrews Sisters and Bill Haley\, for Mercury Records.

Written by musician and civil rights activist Oscar Brown\, Jr.\, the song has been covered by artists as diverse as Abbey Lincoln and Johnny Rivers.  A small boy walked down a city street And hope was in his eyes As he searched the faces of the people he'd meet For one he could recognize  Brother\, where are you? They told me that you came this way Brother\, where are you? They said you came this way  The eyes of the people who passed him by Were cold and hard as stone The poor boy whimpered and began to cry Because he was all alone  Brother\, where are you?

COL title VAL Strom lásky mý COL performer VAL Stanislav Hložek	COL video title VAL Dancing with Tears in my Eyes-Regents Club Orchestra-Bob Haring 1930 COL description VAL Bob Haring (1896-????) Was the singer for several different bands in the 1920s\, including the Colonial Club Orchestra and The Regents Club Orchestra. He disappeared from public view in 1934 when he was laid off from work in the record industry as an executive and then genuinely disappeared for good\, because no one knows what happened to him after that. This was one of his biggest hits\, charting at #25 in 1930 for the year. Also a big(ger) hit for Nat Skrillet in the same year.  Photo is of the Regents Club Dance Hall In Brighton\, England. It was converted to a bingo hall in 1967 and then bulldozed in 1974\, a victim of changing taste in dance music.  50 hits on 9/26/11 100 hits on 11/10/11 250 hits on 3/16/12 500 htis on 9/6/12 COL channel name VAL MusicProjectX	0

COL title VAL Cherry Cherry COL performer VAL The Wishful Thinking	COL video title VAL Neil Diamond - Cherry Cherry (REMASTERED) COL description VAL Remastered by Figago - High Quality   Neil Leslie Diamond (born on January 24\, 1941) is an American singer-songwriter. As a successful pop music performer\, Diamond scored a number of hits worldwide in the 1960s\, 1970s\, and 1980s. According to David Wild\, common themes in Diamond's songs are "a deep sense of isolation and an equal desire for connection. A yearning for home -- and at the same time\, the allure of greater freedom. The good\, the bad and the ugly about a crazy little thing called love."  As of 2001 Diamond has 115 million records sold worldwide\, including 48 million records in the U.S. In terms of Billboard chart success\, he is the third most successful Adult Contemporary artist ever\, ranking behind only Barbra Streisand and Elton John.  Though his record sales declined somewhat after the 1980s\, Diamond continues to tour successfully\, and maintains a very loyal following. Diamond's songs have been recorded by a vast array of performers from many different musical genres.  Diamond was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1984\, and in 2000 received the Sammy Cahn Lifetime Achievement Award.  In 1966 Diamond signed a deal with Bert Berns's Bang Records label\, which was then a subsidiary company of Atlantic Records. His first release on that label\, "Solitary Man"\, was his first hit. Prior to the release of "Solitary Man\," Neil had considered using a stage name; he came up with two possible stage names\, "Noah Kaminsky"[citation needed] and "Eice Chary"[citation needed]. But when asked by Bang Records which name he was going to use\, Noah\, Eice\, or Neil\, he thought of his grandmother\, who died prior to the release of Solitary Man. Thus he told Bang Records\, "...go with Neil Diamond and I'll figure it out later." Diamond followed it with "Cherry\, Cherry"\, "Kentucky Woman"\, "Thank the Lord for the Night Time"\, "Do It\," and others. Diamond's Bang recordings were produced by legendary Brill Building songwriters Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich\, both of whom can be heard singing background on many of the tracks...

Her style was a hybrid of Brill Building-style New York pop\, jazz\, gospel\, rhythm and blues\, show tunes\, rock and soul.  She was best known\, and enjoyed her greatest commercial success\, as a composer and lyricist rather than as a performer. Between 1968 and 1970 a number of other singers had significant hits with her songs: The 5th Dimension with "Blowing Away"\, "Wedding Bell Blues"\, "Stoned Soul Picnic"\, "Sweet Blindness"\, "Save The Country" and "Black Patch"; Blood\, Sweat & Tears and Peter\, Paul & Mary with "And When I Die"; Three Dog Night with "Eli's Coming"; and Barbra Streisand with "Stoney End"\, "Time and Love"\, and "Hands off the Man (Flim Flam Man)". Nyro's best-selling single was her recording of Carole King and Gerry Goffin's "Up on the Roof."   Lyrics:  Loving you so I was too blind to see you letting me go But now that you've set me free It's gonna take a miracle Yes\, it's gonna take a miracle To make me love someone new Cause I'm crazy for you  Oh oh\, didn't you know It wouldn't be so easy lettin' you go I could have told you that it's gonna take a miracle  oh-uh Yes\, it's gonna take a miracle To make me love someone new Cause I'm crazy for you  Oh\, tho' I know I can't forget? about you or come so? will show you how much You're turning me around\, destroying me I'll never be the same anymore  You must realize You took your love and left me Quite by surprise You can be sure that now it's gonna take a miracle Yes\, it's gonna take a miracle To make me love someone new Cause I'm crazy for you COL channel name VAL Mr.Lotsopa	0

Fools Fall In Love  ------------------------  "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" is a song by American punk rock band Green Day. It was released as the second single from their seventh album\, American Idiot. The song was written by Green Day\, with lyrics by lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong. The single peaked at number two in the United States\, making it Green Day's most successful song.  Influences and covers  Noel Gallagher of Oasis criticized Green Day in late 2006\, saying\, "They should have the decency to wait until I am dead [before stealing my songs]. I\, at least\, pay the people I steal from that courtesy"\, referencing the fact that "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" uses the same chord progression as Oasis's hit single "Wonderwall". Gallagher's reaction may have partly been due to the emergence of "Boulevard of Broken Songs"\, a popular mash-up mixed by San Francisco DJ and producer Party Ben in late 2004. The mix consisted of elements from "Boulevard of Broken Dreams"\, "Wonderwall"\, Travis' "Writing to Reach You" and Eminem's "Sing for the Moment"\, which itself has samples from Aerosmith's "Dream On" (another remix by Party Ben featured this\, "Wonderwall" and Kanye West's "Flashing Lights"). This song was covered by Japanese-American singer Hikaru Utada acoustically with a guitar during an internet broadcast in December 2005; a video of it can be found. "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" is sung first and then fades into "Passion" (After the Battle version) from the Kingdom Hearts II original soundtrack. "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" is also featured in the movie trailer of Lords of Dogtown (2005)\, starring Heath Ledger\, Emile Hirsch and John Robinson. Billie Joe Armstrong wrote the song while he was in his son Joey's bedroom.[citation needed] In the 2005 VH1 Storytellers program featuring Green Day\, Billie Joe Armstrong stated that the title of the song was "nicked" from the famous Gottfried Helnwein painting of the same title\, which features James Dean. Four earlier songs also have the same title: an old Harry Warren song\, a Hanoi Rocks song\, a Marianne Faithfull song\, and song by Brian Setzer from his 1986 album The Knife Feels Like Justice Lyrics from the song bear some resemblance to the Pinhead Gunpowder song "I Walk Alone"\, a band in which Billie Joe Armstrong also sings. It appeared on their 1997 album\, Goodbye Ellston Avenue. The song also shares some lyrics with the Whitesnake song "Here I Go Again"\, the words "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" can be found in the lyrics of the Elvis Costello song "Brilliant Mistake"\, the Allman Brothers Band song "End of the Line"\, the Deadsy song "The Key to Gramercy Park"\, and The Ataris song "Road Signs and Rock Songs". The phrase "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" also appears in punk/new wave band Blondie's 1982 minor UK-hit single Island of Lost Souls. A live version of the song can be found on Bullet in a Bible\, a live album of Green Day performing at the Milton Keynes National Bowl. Bluegrass band Cornbread Red did a cover of the song on a tribute album to Green Day Pickin' on Green Day\, while the German choir Gregorian did a cover\, on their Masters of Chant Chapter V album\, in the style of a Gregorian Chant. Mark Mallman covered this song on his MP3-only compilation release Outtakes Vol 1. The song is also featured in Green Day's musical American Idiot\, sung on the cast recording by John Gallagher Jr.\, Rebecca Naomi Jones\, and the rest of the company.

COL title VAL Trouble Man COL performer VAL Neneh Cherry	COL video title VAL The Charlie Daniels Band - Pride And Joy.wmv COL description VAL Tailgate Party This CD contains some of the greatest rock songs of all time. Originally made legendary by some of the south's best rock bands\, Charlie adds his own unique sound to each song. Originals\, live and studio versions make this collection live up to its' name by being a great one to pull out during a "Tailgate Party."   Description      13 Tracks previously released in 1999     Engineered\, Produced and Mixed by: Ron W. Griffin     Executive Producer: David Corlew  Guide Review - Charlie Daniels Band - Tailgate Party  Included on this very southern rock flavored collection are live versions of "The Legend of Wooley Swamp" and "The Devil Went Down to Georgia." With both songs being so well known and played a gazillion times\, it was refreshing to hear them live and just slightly different from what we are normally accustomed to.  "The South's Gonna Do It Again" had an added bonus to it by having a very early on in his career performance by Keith Urban\, showing us some very impressive guitar solo's. Remakes of ZZ Top's "Sharp Dressed Man" and Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Freebird" were very captivating and showed off some incredible fiddle playing by Charlie. Probably one of my most favorites was CDB's remake of the song made famous by Hootie and the Blowfish\, "Let Her Cry." Charlie has always been well known for his playing but under rated for his vocals. This song shows off just how well he can deliver some very heartfelt emotions and I really enjoyed listening to this new version.  If you have ever appreciated CDB\, you will really like this release. If for nothing else\, the diversity of the genre's and CDB being able to add the country sound without destroying the memory of the song.

Come a little bit closer\, you're my kind of man So big and so strong Come a little bit closer\, I'm all alone And the night is so long. Hmmmm. So we started to dance\, in my arms she felt so inviting Mmmmmm\, I just couldn't resist\, a-just a-one little kiss so exciting Then I heard the guitar player say\, va-moose\, Jose's on his way And I knew\, yes I knew\, I should run\, but then I heard her say. Come a little bit closer\, you're my kind of man So big and so strong Come a little bit closer\, I'm all alone And the night is so long. Ha\, ha\, ha\, alright. Laaa-laaa\, la-la\, laaa-laaa\, la-la Laaa-laaa\, la-la\, laaa-laaa\, la-la Then the music stopped\, when I looked\, the cafe was empty Then I heard Jose say\, man\, you know you're in trouble plenty So I dropped my drink from my hand\, and out through the window I ran And as I rode away\, I could hear her say to Jose. Come a little bit closer\, you're my kind of man So big and so strong Come a little bit closer\, I'm all alone And the night is so long. Come a little bit closer\, you're my kind of man So big and so strong Come a little bit closer\, I'm all alone And the night is so long.

I've only added the footage as a tribute for historical\, entertainment\, and creative purposes with no financial gain. Copyright infringement not intended.  The Four Tunes "I Sold My Heart To The Junkman" Jubilee 5174 A 1954  Here are The Four Tunes with their version of "I Sold My Heart To The Junkman." This is the 2nd pressing that was released in 1954 by Jubilee\, in the same year as the 1st pressing. A nice\, minty\, clean 78 for your enjoyment.  The 4 Tunes were probably the leading black Pop vocal group during the 1950s. Their origins can be traced back to a change of personnel in the Ink Spots. This requires a brief review of some events in the mid-40s. In June 1944\, during an engagement in Chicago\, Hoppy Jones became ill and the group had to finish a tour without him (Deek Watson filled in on the mandatory talking parts). This had unsuspected ramifications. Hoppy was the conciliatory father figure (nicknamed "the grand old man") of the Ink Spots. Now that he was missing\, infighting between Bill Kenny and Deek Watson\, which had formerly just smoldered\, now flared up unchecked. Deek had been the leader of the group until their 1939 smash of "If I Didn't Care." Since then\, Bill had firmly established himself in the forefront of the Ink Spots\, pushing Deek further and further into the background. Hoppy returned in August\, but by then\, the damage had been done.  When he announced (in the January 1945 settlement of the lawsuits) that he would form a new group based "on a completely new idea\," he simply changed their name to the "Brown Dots" (the name does sound somewhat familiar\, doesn't it?). As it turned out\, the "new idea" was to sound as much like the Ink Spots as possible. One real difference was that the Brown Dots relied more on harmony than the Ink Spots\, who were more individualists. (Since the Brown Dots were also managed by Moe Gale\, we know who the hands-down winner in this contest was.)  The polished style of the 4 Tunes was the product of their training\, experience\, dedication\, and discipline. Their songs were carefully selected and arranged. Their first arranger was pianist Ralph Herman\, who was the youngest member of Paul Whiteman's Orchestra. They also worked with Howard Biggs (whose most famous association was with the Ravens).  In mid-1953\, they once again changed labels (since they weren't making any royalties from RCA). This time they went to Jerry Blaine's Jubilee label\, where they achieved their greatest popularity. Their first Jubilee recording\, "Marie\," was released in September\, and reached #2 on the R&B charts (#13 Pop). This Irving Berlin tune had been a #1 smash for Tommy Dorsey (Jack Leonard on vocal) back in 1937. ("Marie" was such a big hit that the purely R&B Dominoes and Larks were pushed to sing in the same kind of Pop mold.) Their next Jubilee release\, "I Understand Just How You Feel" was an even bigger hit\, climbing to #6 on the Pop charts (#7 R&B).  1954 saw two releases on the Kay-Ron label. These were old Manor cuts (although different takes). Two of them were backups to Savannah Churchill ("Savannah Sings The Blues" and "I Want To Be Loved"). The other two were "Just In Case You Change Your Mind" (which was actually by the Brown Dots) and "I Understand" (which was presumably released to confuse record buyers into thinking it was the same song as the current "I Understand Just How You Feel").  On Jubilee\, the 4 Tunes were primarily a Pop group (although they did turn out something called "Rock N Roll Call"). Their output included "Don't Cry Darling\," "L'amour\, Toujours L'amour\," "I Sold My Heart To The Junkman\," "Time Out For Tears\," "You Are My Love\," "Far Away Places\," "Dancing With Tears In My Eyes\," "Sayonara\," and "A Little On The Lonely Side."  The 4 Tunes appeared for a week at the Apollo Theater (beginning April 2\, 1955)\, along with Red Prysock's Orchestra. They played both the black theater circuit and also many white clubs. When they were on a tour with Joni James\, she asked Jimmie Nabbie to write a song for her. The result\, "You Are My Love\," was her big hit of 1955 (which the 4 Tunes covered).  In 1955\, the 4 Tunes were booked into the Hacienda in Las Vegas on a handshake\, and stayed for eight years. Other members\, added at the time\, were Smiley Hightower (guitar and bassist) and Eddie Williams (bassist; formerly of Johnny Moore's Three Blazers). Also\, tenor Billy Wells (from Deek's second Brown Dots group) was hired so that each of the other members could go on vacation on a rotating basis.

Cale\, Snuff Garrett  This was a Snuff Garrett project as a compilation album of covers of numbers that were popular on Hollywood's Sunset Strip. These were combined with newly-written numbers by J.J. Cale who was a member of the makeshift group assembled for the recording\, who called themselves "The Leathercoated Minds".  ------------------------  "Along Comes Mary" is a song composed by Tandyn Almer\, originally recorded in 1966 by American sunshine pop band the Association. It was the group's first hit\, released on their debut album\, And Then... Along Comes the Association (1966).  Background  "Along Comes Mary" is sung from the point of view of a once-disillusioned young man talking about the "tribulations no one ever sees" and who "curse[s] those faults in me." The singer believes Mary gives him comfort and improves his life. An acquaintance of Almer claimed in an interview that "Mary" refers to marijuana\, though it is unclear if Almer ever confirmed this. In the Young People's Concert titled What Is a Mode? Leonard Bernstein explained that the song was composed in the Dorian mode.  Bloodhound Gang version  American rock band Bloodhound Gang recorded a version of "Along Comes Mary" with new punk music to accompany the lyrics. It first appeared on the 1998 soundtrack to the film Half Baked before appearing on Bloodhound Gang's third studio album\, Hooray for Boobies\, the following year. "Along Comes Mary" was released as the album's first single in May 1999 and reached No. 5 in Austria\, No. 6 in Germany\, and No. 13 in Switzerland. The song was certified gold in both Austria and Germany.  Other covers  In 1966\, Hugh Masekela included the song on his album Hugh Masekela's Next Album\, and in 1967\, Cal Tjader covered it for his album Along Comes Cal. That same year\, Baja Marimba Band's had a minor hit with their cover of the song.  In 1968\, George Benson included a version on his album Giblet Gravy\, and in 1986 a cover appeared on R. Stevie Moore's album Glad Music.  In 1995\, the Manhattan Transfer covered the song for their album Tonin'\, and the following year\, 24-7 Spyz covered it for their album 6.  In 2005\, a cover of the song appeared on the Guess Who's compilation album Let's Go\, and Plainsong also released a cover on their self-titled album.  ------------------------  Lyrics  Every time I think that I'm the only one who's lonely someone calls on me. And every now and then I spend my time in rhyme and verse and curse those faults in me.  And then along comes Mary And does she want to give me kicks\, and be my steady chick and give me pick of memories Or maybe rather gather tales of all the fails and tribulations no one ever sees.  When we met I was sure out to lunch Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch.  When vague desire is the fire in the eyes of chicks whose sickness is the games they play. And when the masquerade is played and neighbor folks make jokes as who is most to blame today.  And then along comes Mary And does she want to set them free\, and let them see reality from where she got her name. And will they struggle much when told that such a tender touch as hers will make them not the same.  When we met I was sure out to lunch Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch\, sweet as the punch\, sweet as the punch\, sweet as the punch\, sweet as the punch.

Thomas\, Bill Medley\, Chuck Leavell and Judith Hill  Ever since his glorious surprise version of “The Way You Look Tonight” in the 1991 film “Father of The Bride” paved the way for his extraordinary second career as a GRAMMY Award winning vocalist/producer\, Steve Tyrell has been setting A New Standard (the title of his 1999 debut album) for interpreting the Great American Songbook – most notably on Songs of Sinatra (which reached #5 on the Billboard Jazz Albums chart) and his most recent Concord Records release\, It’s Magic: The Songs of Sammy Cahn (#2). On his 11th album\, That Lovin’ Feeling\, he celebrates what he calls “the Great American Songbook 2; the next generation of the Songbook\,” recording seminal rock era classics penned by legendary songwriters (many renowned for hits penned at New York’s famed Brill Building) who are also cherished longtime friends.   While sharing the enduring magic of timeless songs by the songwriting teams of Carole King and Gerry Goffin\, Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller\, Barry Mann & Cynthia Weil and Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich as well as Burt Bacharach\, Neil Sedaka\, Toni Wine and Carole Bayer Sager\, That Lovin’ Feeling sets itself apart from most tribute recordings with spirited guest vocal appearances by Mann\, B.J. Thomas\, Neil Sedaka and Bill Medley in addition to renowned backup singer Judith Hill (featured in the Oscar winning documentary “20 Feet From Stardom”) and Tyrell’s daughter Lauryn Tyrell.

The record was released in June 1979 on Optional Music with "The Man with the Dogs" as the b-side. The title track was re-recorded for the band's first album\, Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables (1980)\, and the version that appeared on this single\, as well as the single's b-side\, are available on the rarities album Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death (1987).  The lyrics were written by Jello Biafra and John Greenway\, and Biafra composed the music in one of his rare attempts at composing on bass.  This song was featured in the video game Tony Hawk's American Wasteland and as a downloadable song in the Rock Band series. It is also sampled in a song by the dance-punk/big beat trio The Prodigy\, "Dead Ken Beats". The song was also featured in the 2010 film The Social Network.  Meaning  The title is an allusion to the first (and no longer sung) stanza of the national anthem of Germany\, which begins with the words "Deutschland\, Deutschland über alles." (literally\, "Germany\, Germany above all.")  The song focuses on Jerry Brown\, the Governor of California 1975-1983 and 2011--present\, and is sung from his perspective. An imaginary Brown outlines a hippie-fascist vision for America\, in which his "suede denim secret police" kill un-cool people with "organic poison gas" chambers. Lines such as "Serpent's egg already hatched" (a reference to a line from William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar) comment on the corrosive nature of power. The line "now it is 1984" refers to the totalitarian regime of George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four\, describing a future (from 1979) where Jerry Brown has become President Brown presiding over secret police and gas chambers.  Cover versions  Blue Ribbon Glee Club regularly perform their version of the song.  The song was updated by The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy when they released a cover version in 1992 on the album Hypocrisy is the Greatest Legacy. They replaced references to Jerry Brown with references to Pete Wilson.  The song was also widely known in Poland (as "Kalifornia Ponad Wszystko") thanks to the cover by Polish rocker Kazik Staszewski with his band Kazik Na Żywo.  Hasidic New Wave perform a remake of the song on their 1999 album\, Kabalogy. In their version\, titled "Giuliani Über Alles"\, Jerry Brown is replaced by former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani.  The Delgados cover the song in their Peel Sessions CD set.  Six Feet Under do a cover the song on their Graveyard Classics album.  The black metal band Mayhem also covered the song.  Deceased covered the song on their punk covers album Rotten to the Core.  The hardcore band Ceremony has covered the song.  The Who Boys have done a mashup of "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" by Gil Scott-Heron called "Revolution Über Alles".  John Linnell and his band The Statesmen covered it live at least once during his "State Songs" tour\, choosing to perform it because it mentioned the state of California.  Dramarama has recorded a version\, updated in 2003 about California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger... "You will lift weights in school".  A 1986 live recording focused on Ronald Reagan on the album Mutiny On The Bay with live recordings from 1982 and 1986.  Jayne County covered the song with She Wolves about California's Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The green vinyl single was released under artist name Jayne County Meets The She Wolves by the German label Trash 2001.  Mexican death metal band Brujería covers Dead Kennedys with the song "California Uber Aztlan" in 2010. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

In retrospect\, it would have appeared that the Souls  may have been a decade ahead of time\, b'cos head today\, Live On sounds amazingly current with it's mix of roots\, funk\, soul\, jazz and pop \, and while it is true that it might be the least Jamaicans sounding of their albums\, with pedigree of crack island session players like Sly & Robbie\, Dwight Pinkney\, Sticky Thompson and Earl Lindo all over the tracks..."

Scammell The Squid Jiggin' Ground Part 1 (with lyrics) COL description VAL Oh\, this is the place where the fishermen gather\,  With oilskins and boots and Cape Anns battened down;  All sizes of figures with squid lines and jiggers\,  They congregate here on the squid-jigging ground.   Some are workin' their jiggers while others are yarnin'\,  There's some standin' up and there's more lyin' down;  While all kinds of fun\, jokes and tricks are begun  As they wait for the squid on the squid-jiggin' ground.   There's men of all ages and boys in the bargain;  There's old Billy Cave and there's young Raymond Brown\,  There's a red rantin' Tory out here in a dory\,  A-runnin' down Squires on the squid-jiggin' ground.   There's men from the Harbour and men from the Tickle\,  In all kinds of motorboats\, green\, grey and brown;  Right yonder is Bobby and with him is Nobby\,  He's chawin' hard tack on the squid-jiggin' ground.   God bless my sou'wester\, there's Skipper John Chaffey\,  He's the best hand at squid-jiggin' here\, I'll be bound.  Hello! What's the row? Why he's jiggin' one now\,  The very first squid on the squid-jiggin' ground.   The man with the whiskers is old Jacob Steele;  He's gettin well up but he's still pretty sound.  While Uncle Bob Hawkins wears six pair o' stockin's  Whenever he's out on the squid-jiggin' ground.   Holy smoke! What a scuffle! All hands are excited.  'Tis a wonder to me that there's nobody drowned.  There's confusion\, a bustle\, a wonderful hustle\,  They're all jiggin' squids on the squid-jiggin' ground.   Says Bobby\, "The squids are on top of the water\,  I just got me jigger 'bout one fathom down" ---  When a squid in the boat squirted right down his throat\,  And he's swearin' like mad on the squid-jiggin' ground.   There's poor Uncle Billy\, his whiskers are spattered  With spots of the squid juice that's flying around;  One poor little b'y got it right in the eye\,  But they don't give a damn on the squid-jiggin' ground.   Now if ever you feel inclined to go squiddin'\,  Leave your white shirts and collars behind in the town.  And if you get cranky without your silk hanky  You'd better steer clear of the squid-jiggin' ground.   Found in a used record store dollar bin in Sydney\, Cape Breton\, NS\, 2002.

The record was released in June 1979 on Optional Music with "The Man with the Dogs" as the b-side. The title track was re-recorded for the band's first album\, Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables (1980)\, and the version that appeared on this single\, as well as the single's b-side\, are available on the rarities album Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death (1987).  The lyrics were written by Jello Biafra and John Greenway\, and Biafra composed the music in one of his rare attempts at composing on bass.  This song was featured in the video game Tony Hawk's American Wasteland and as a downloadable song in the Rock Band series. It is also sampled in a song by the dance-punk/big beat trio The Prodigy\, "Dead Ken Beats". The song was also featured in the 2010 film The Social Network.  Meaning  The title is an allusion to the first (and no longer sung) stanza of the national anthem of Germany\, which begins with the words "Deutschland\, Deutschland über alles." (literally\, "Germany\, Germany above all.")  The song focuses on Jerry Brown\, the Governor of California 1975-1983 and 2011--present\, and is sung from his perspective. An imaginary Brown outlines a hippie-fascist vision for America\, in which his "suede denim secret police" kill un-cool people with "organic poison gas" chambers. Lines such as "Serpent's egg already hatched" (a reference to a line from William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar) comment on the corrosive nature of power. The line "now it is 1984" refers to the totalitarian regime of George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four\, describing a future (from 1979) where Jerry Brown has become President Brown presiding over secret police and gas chambers.  Cover versions  Blue Ribbon Glee Club regularly perform their version of the song.  The song was updated by The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy when they released a cover version in 1992 on the album Hypocrisy is the Greatest Legacy. They replaced references to Jerry Brown with references to Pete Wilson.  The song was also widely known in Poland (as "Kalifornia Ponad Wszystko") thanks to the cover by Polish rocker Kazik Staszewski with his band Kazik Na Żywo.  Hasidic New Wave perform a remake of the song on their 1999 album\, Kabalogy. In their version\, titled "Giuliani Über Alles"\, Jerry Brown is replaced by former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani.  The Delgados cover the song in their Peel Sessions CD set.  Six Feet Under do a cover the song on their Graveyard Classics album.  The black metal band Mayhem also covered the song.  Deceased covered the song on their punk covers album Rotten to the Core.  The hardcore band Ceremony has covered the song.  The Who Boys have done a mashup of "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" by Gil Scott-Heron called "Revolution Über Alles".  John Linnell and his band The Statesmen covered it live at least once during his "State Songs" tour\, choosing to perform it because it mentioned the state of California.  Dramarama has recorded a version\, updated in 2003 about California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger... "You will lift weights in school".  A 1986 live recording focused on Ronald Reagan on the album Mutiny On The Bay with live recordings from 1982 and 1986.  Jayne County covered the song with She Wolves about California's Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The green vinyl single was released under artist name Jayne County Meets The She Wolves by the German label Trash 2001.  Mexican death metal band Brujería covers Dead Kennedys with the song "California Uber Aztlan" in 2010. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

COL title VAL Boogie Stop Shuffle COL performer VAL Stefan Pasborg's Odessa 5	COL video title VAL DENI HINES & CHRISTINE ANU - TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS COL description VAL Two of Australias most loved and successful female recording artists\, Deni Hines and Christine Anu\, are takin it to the streets again in 2009 after the success of their 2008 East-Coast of Australia tour.    On the first tour we had such a great time\, that we wanted to do it all over again\, especially when we have such a great cause to promote such as the Salvation Army and Oasis Youth Support Network. We feel privileged to be able to help says Christine & Deni.    In a two hour show\, this sassy duo will perform their classic hits and favourite timeless songs along with some special duets\, including their own rendition of the Doobie Brothers hit TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS.   While promoting their 2008 tour\, Deni and Christine so happened to be performing one of their show duets TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS on the Today Show (Nine Network\, Australia). On the same show was a heartfelt segment about the plight of homelessness in Australia accompanied by Captain Paul Mould of the Salvation Armys Oasis Youth Support Network\, who take care and provide much needed services for the homeless and youth of Australia (who come from all walks of life.)  No less than 5 minutes after walking off set\, Christine and Deni turned to each other and said weve got to do something to help and the recording of TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS was set in motion.   Deni and Christine will release their version of TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS on 15 November 2008 (Nationwide) with fifty percent (50%) of profits going to the Salvation Armys Youth Homelessness Oasis Foundation and the Everyone Is Homeless Fund.  On Wednesday\, 17th December Christine and Deni will also stage a free Christmas concert version of their TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS show exclusively for the Salvation Armys Youth Homelessness Oasis Foundation and the homeless people of Sydney.   For further information on Salvation Armys Youth Homelessness Oasis Foundation and the Everyone Is Homeless Fund\, please refer to www.oasis.salvos.org.au  In the ABS Census 2001 (The 2006 Census data has not been finalized)\, there were 100\,000 homeless people (men\, women and children) across Australia\, one third (36\,173) are youth between 12-24 years of age.  Only 14.25% of homeless people were able to stay in services funded through SAAP (Supported Accommodation Assistance Program) jointly funded by both the Commonwealth and State Governments.  Christine and Deni would like to thank the following companies and people for donating their time and services free of charge of the purposes of this donation campaign drive -  301 Studios\, Sing Sing Studios\, David and Anthony @ DNA Songs\, Tony Espie\, David Walker at Stepford Audio\, John Adams\, Franco Raggatt\, Barbara Griffin\, Cameron Undy\, Michael Rohanek and Rob Thompson.

Banes Drums\, Percussion -- Jimmy Young  ------------------------  "Fire" is a 1968 song by Arthur Brown\, Vincent Crane\, Mike Finesilver and Peter Ker. Performed by The Crazy World of Arthur Brown\, it was released as a single and on the band's debut album\, also called The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. The single made #1 in the UK (in August 1968) and Canada. In October\, it made #2 in the US Billboard charts and #19 in Australia. It also made #6 in the Netherlands. "Fire" sold over one million copies\, and was awarded a gold disc.  The song is an example of the psychedelic rock of the period\, though its lack of guitars or bass guitar distinguished it from many of its contemporaries. The lead instrument in this case was Vincent Crane's Hammond electronic organ\, augmented by an orchestral section featuring prominent brass. The singer's opening proclamation of himself as "the god of hellfire" became a lasting epithet. The song's other memorable line is "You're Gonna Burn!!". The song ends with the sound of a wind from hell.  During live performances and in the black and white promotional television clip\, Brown performed the song wearing a burning helmet. The helmet was improvised with a leather skull cap onto which was bolted a metal dish that held lighter fluid or petrol. As the cap was not insulated\, the heat from the burning fuel quickly conducted through the fixing bolt to the top of Brown's head\, causing him considerable pain.  Two studio mixes of "Fire" have been officially released\, one in stereo and one in mono. The mono mix features no brass. Both versions are included on the CD reissue of The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. The single B-side\, "Rest Cure"\, was another track from the album.  Credit for the composition of "Fire" on the original vinyl single was to Arthur Brown and Vincent Crane only; however\, Mike Finesilver and Peter Ker successfully sued for co-credit and royalties based on melodic similarities to their song "Baby\, You're a Long Way Behind".  The song is briefly featured in the films Hot Fuzz (2007) and The Boat That Rocked (2009). It is also referenced in Julie Hearn's debut novel Follow Me Down\, and was used in the episode "Burn Victim" of My Name Is Earl.  Cover versions  The Ventures covered the song on their 1969 album Underground Fire. Lizzy Mercier Descloux covered "Fire" on her album Press Color (1979)\, drastically changing the mood and style of the track. Pete Townshend\, the single's associate producer\, covered "Fire" as a member of The Who on his 1989 album The Iron Man: A Musical. Cirith Ungol covered the song on their 1991 album Paradise Lost. The Prodigy sampled the track for "Fire/Jericho"\, which was otherwise a completely different song\, on their 1992 album Experience. Emerson\, Lake & Palmer covered the song on their 1993 4-disc compilation album The Return of the Manticore. German dark electro act AmGod covered the song several times. The most well-known version is "Fire v.2" featured on the 1994 album Half Rotten and Decayed. Though it was not a true 'cover'\, Marilyn Manson's "Lunchbox" (1995) heavily samples "Fire". UK doom metal band Cathedral covered the song on their 1996 EP Hopkins (The Witchfinder General). Die Krupps covered the song on their 1997 album Paradise Now. Dutch death metal band God Dethroned covered the song on their 1997 album The Grand Grimoire. Ozzy Osbourne included a version on his 2005 album Under Cover. The song is used in one episode of Series 3 of Monkey Dust (2005) as the Paedofinder General burns the wrongly accused paedophiles with this music in the background\, complete with bastardised lyrics. US Hip hop duo Cunninlynguists sampled the song for "Hellfire" on their 2006 album A Piece of Strange. Leningrad Cowboys covered the song in a metal style and included it on their 2006 album Zombie's Paradise. Appears in the musical Disco Inferno\, when the character Duke reveals himself to be Satan in disguise.[citation needed] Death Grips\, an experimental hip hop group backed by drummer Zach Hill\, sampled "Fire" in their song "Lord of the Game".

Between 1921 and 1935 many musicians joined and left the California Ramblers including the famous Dorsey Brothers and the very eccentric\, Jack Purvis (trombone and trumpet)\, who is said to have trashed and burned hotel rooms\, flown as a soldier of fortune\, played 52nd St.\, scored music for full orchestra\, and eventually led a prison band. Other members included Adrian Rollini (bass sax and xylophone)\, Fud Livingston and Bobby Davis (saxophones)\, and Chelsea Quealey.     During the 1920s the band was so in demand that they purchased a hotel on Pelham Parkway in the Bronx where they lived\, practiced\, and performed\, and dubbed it the Ramblers Inn. They went on to play some of the greatest clubs in New York City including the Rainbow Room at the top of the Rockefeller Center.     The original recordings made here were all “acoustical” 78s and interestingly\, recorded prior to the introduction of the microphone in 1925.     Although the music has been all but lost in our modern society\, it is my hope that these remastered jewels plucked from of our early American traditions will now live on into the 21st century and beyond.

COL title VAL How'Ya Gonna Keep 'Em Down on the Farm COL performer VAL Lt. Jim Europe's 369th Infantry "Hell Fighters" Band	COL video title VAL "How Ya Gonna Keep 'Em Down on the Farm?" (Nora Bayes\, 1919) COL description VAL America was as quick in getting out of Europe following World War One as she was tardy in entering that conflict. As a nation\, we were forever transformed...America's involvement in World War One brought a change of character with it\, and that change was felt nowhere more keenly than Rural America. Looking back\, the family farm has been in decline ever since. Walter Donaldson wrote the music to this in 1919 (Joe Young and Sam M. Lewis wrote the words)\, and the song wound up being an overnight smash hit. It was recorded by nearly everyone\, but no rendition was more sublimely spirited than this one\, recorded for Columbia by Nora Bayes - a vaudeville talent of legendary proportions.   HOW YA GONNA KEEP 'EM DOWN ON THE FARM?  Reuben\, Reuben\, I've been thinking Said his wifey dear Now that all is peaceful and calm The boys will soon be back on the farm Mister Reuben started winking and slowly rubbed his chin He pulled his chair up close to mother And he asked her with a grin  How ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm After they've seen Paree' How ya gonna keep 'em away from Broadway Jazzin around and paintin' the town How ya gonna keep 'em away from harm\, that's a mystery They'll never want to see a rake or plow And who the deuce can parleyvous a cow? How ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm After they've seen Paree'?  How ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm After they've seen Paree' How ya gonna keep 'em away from Broadway Jazzin around and paintin' the town How ya gonna keep 'em away from harm\, that's a mystery Imagine Reuben when he meets his Pa He'll kiss his cheek and holler "OO-LA-LA! How ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm After they've seen Paree'? COL channel name VAL RReady555	1

I'm still not sure what to make of same sex marriage. I am a stout conservative however I believe that people should be free to share their lives with whom they wish or fall in love with regardless of sexual barriers and live it as they see fit as long as harm is not brought to others\, judgments I leave to God\, that is regarding that my rights are not encroached upon by the rights of others.  This being said I do believe that if not marriage as defined between a men and a woman there should be similar laws that protect and gives the proper rights to any two persons who form a serious home and a relationship together.  I do have friends who are in such relationships\, I do not condone discrimination based on sexual preferences and to them I dedicate this record by the great Charles Aznavour\,  it tells a touching and very lonely story.

'Classic Folk Music from Smithsonian Folkways Recordings' is available on CD and digital.  Stream/download/purchase: Smithsonian Folkways: https://folkways.si.edu/classic-folk-music-from-folkways-recordings/american-folk/music/album/smithsonian Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/album/3ZvJN4KO7r0ivacGwObKVt?si=XdZ6zndVS6SR_0xDGyfUag  We often take for granted the supremacy of artists such as Doc Watson\, Woody Guthrie\, Pete Seeger\, Lead Belly\, Big Bill Broonzy\, Brownie McGhee\, and other folk music legends. Classic Folk sheds new light on the success of the urban intellectual-driven movement that made rural white and African-American artists and their music favorites of audiences everywhere. This recording features classic performances by classic artists doing some of their classic songs during the great folksong revival of the 1940s through 1960s. It features some of the great performances from the vaults of Folkways Records. Compiled and annotated by Jeff Place.

Scammell The Squid Jiggin' Ground Part 1 (with lyrics) COL description VAL Oh\, this is the place where the fishermen gather\,  With oilskins and boots and Cape Anns battened down;  All sizes of figures with squid lines and jiggers\,  They congregate here on the squid-jigging ground.   Some are workin' their jiggers while others are yarnin'\,  There's some standin' up and there's more lyin' down;  While all kinds of fun\, jokes and tricks are begun  As they wait for the squid on the squid-jiggin' ground.   There's men of all ages and boys in the bargain;  There's old Billy Cave and there's young Raymond Brown\,  There's a red rantin' Tory out here in a dory\,  A-runnin' down Squires on the squid-jiggin' ground.   There's men from the Harbour and men from the Tickle\,  In all kinds of motorboats\, green\, grey and brown;  Right yonder is Bobby and with him is Nobby\,  He's chawin' hard tack on the squid-jiggin' ground.   God bless my sou'wester\, there's Skipper John Chaffey\,  He's the best hand at squid-jiggin' here\, I'll be bound.  Hello! What's the row? Why he's jiggin' one now\,  The very first squid on the squid-jiggin' ground.   The man with the whiskers is old Jacob Steele;  He's gettin well up but he's still pretty sound.  While Uncle Bob Hawkins wears six pair o' stockin's  Whenever he's out on the squid-jiggin' ground.   Holy smoke! What a scuffle! All hands are excited.  'Tis a wonder to me that there's nobody drowned.  There's confusion\, a bustle\, a wonderful hustle\,  They're all jiggin' squids on the squid-jiggin' ground.   Says Bobby\, "The squids are on top of the water\,  I just got me jigger 'bout one fathom down" ---  When a squid in the boat squirted right down his throat\,  And he's swearin' like mad on the squid-jiggin' ground.   There's poor Uncle Billy\, his whiskers are spattered  With spots of the squid juice that's flying around;  One poor little b'y got it right in the eye\,  But they don't give a damn on the squid-jiggin' ground.   Now if ever you feel inclined to go squiddin'\,  Leave your white shirts and collars behind in the town.  And if you get cranky without your silk hanky  You'd better steer clear of the squid-jiggin' ground.   Found in a used record store dollar bin in Sydney\, Cape Breton\, NS\, 2002. Record released in 1942\, or thenabouts.

Her infectious spirit\, impeccable musicality\, and sheer joy in her faith are obvious in every recording and are a source of great inspiration.  http://www.rhiannongiddens.com/ http://www.twitter.com/rhiannongiddens http://www.instagram.com/rhiannongiddens http://www.facebook.com/RhiannonGiddensMusic COL channel name VAL Rhiannon Giddens	0

It was released on the band's fifth full-length studio album\, Document\, and also as a 7" vinyl single in 1987. The song was their first hit single\, reaching #9 in the US Billboard Hot 100\, #14 in Canada\, and later reached #16 in the UK singles chart on its UK release (1991).  The song was included in Activision's Guitar Hero World Tour and is in Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades.  The accompanying video's director was artist Robert Longo.  The director of photography was Alton Brown\, who later became a Food Network chef.  In March 2005\, Q magazine placed "The One I Love" at number 57 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks.  The song is included on R.E.M. Live.  Lyrics and meaning  Many listeners who misunderstand the song's meaning have made the song a popular radio dedication to loved ones\, relying on the main lyric\, "This one goes out to the one I love."  However\, they missed an ensuing line: "A simple prop to occupy my time"; the song was not particularly a love song.  Stipe related in 1987 to Rolling Stone\, "I've always left myself pretty open to interpretation. It's probably better that they just think it's a love song at this point."  However\, in an interview in the January 1988 issue of Musician magazine he said that the song was "incredibly violent" and "It's very clear that it's about using people over and over again".  The song contains only three verses\, which are all near identical\, with small variations each repeat of the verse. (For example "A simple prop to occupy my time"\, "Another prop has occupied my time"). The chorus consists of just the word "fire"\, repeated (with the backing vocal of "She's coming down on her own now/Coming down on her own"\, sung by Mike Mills).  Cover versions  Bush Sufjan Stevens Massacre and many more. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	0

COL title VAL Motorbreath COL performer VAL Arise	COL video title VAL The Crazy World of Arthur Brown-Fire  (1968) COL description VAL "Fire" is a 1968 song by Arthur Brown\, Vincent Crane\, Mike Finesilver and Peter Ker. Performed by the Crazy World of Arthur Brown\, it was released as a single and on the band's debut album\, also called The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. The single made #1 in the UK (in August 1968) and Canada. In October\, it made #2 in the US Billboard charts and #19 in Australia. It also made number 6 in The Netherlands.  The song is an example of the psychedelic rock of the period\, though its lack of guitars distinguished it from many of its contemporaries. The lead instrument in this case was Vincent Crane's Hammond electronic organ\, augmented by an orchestral section featuring prominent brass. The singer's opening proclamation of himself as "the god of hellfire" became a lasting epithet.  *i posted this video only for entertainment purposes* COL channel name VAL elodd90	0

COL title VAL Unbelievable COL performer VAL Killdozer	COL video title VAL Mister Magic - Grover Washington\, Jr. (1974) COL description VAL "Mister Magic" was the successful single and title track from the fifth album of one of jazz music's more well-known figures.  Grover Washington\, Jr. (December 12\, 1943 -- December 17\, 1999) was an American jazz-funk / soul-jazz saxophonist.  Along with George Benson\, John Klemmer\, David Sanborn\, Bob James\, Chuck Mangione\, Herb Alpert\, and Spyro Gyra\, he is considered by many to be one of the founders of the smooth jazz genre.  He wrote some of his material and later became an arranger and producer.  Washington was born in Buffalo\, New York on December 12\, 1943.  His mother was a church chorister\, and his father was a collector of old jazz gramophone records and a saxophonist as well\, so music was everywhere in the home.  He grew up with the great jazzmen and big band leaders like Benny Goodman\, Fletcher Henderson\, and others like them.  At the age of 8\, with the desire for him to be more than he could be\, Grover Sr. gave Jr. a saxophone.  He practiced and would sneak into clubs to see famous Buffalo blues musicians.  Washington left Buffalo and played with a Midwest group called the Four Clefs.  He was drafted into the U.S. Army shortly thereafter\, but this was to be to his advantage\, as he met drummer Billy Cobham there.  Cobham\, a mainstay in New York City\, introduced Washington to many New York musicians.  After leaving the Army\, Washington freelanced his talents around New York City\, eventually landing in Philadelphia in 1967.  In 1970 and 1971\, he appeared on Leon Spencer's first two albums on Prestige Records\, together with Idris Muhammad and Melvin Sparks.  Washington's big break came at the expense of another artist.  Alto sax man Hank Crawford was unable to make a recording date with Creed Taylor's Kudu Records\, and Washington took his place\, even though he was a backup.  This led to his first solo album\, "Inner City Blues".  He was talented and displayed heart and soul with soprano\, alto\, tenor\, and baritone saxophones.  Refreshing for his time\, he made headway into the jazz mainstream.  His fifth album\, 1974's "Mister Magic"\, was a commercial success\, and introduced guitarist Eric Gale as a near-permanent member in Washington's arsenal.  Throughout the 1970s and 1980s\, Washington made some of the genre's most memorable hits\, including "Mr. Magic" and "Black Frost.  In addition\, he performed very frequently with other artists\, including Bill Withers on "Just The Two Of Us" (still in regular rotation on radio today)\, Patti LaBelle on "The Best Is Yet To Come" and Phyllis Hyman on "A Sacred Kind Of Love".  He is also remembered for his take on the Dave Brubeck classic "Take Five"\, and for his 1996 version of "Soulful Strut".  On December 17\, 1999\, while waiting in the green room after taping four songs for "The Saturday Early Show" at CBS Studios in New York City\, Washington collapsed.  He was taken to St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital\, where he was pronounced dead at about 7:30 p.m.  He was 56 years old.  His doctors determined that he had suffered a massive heart attack.

Shaw\, who was born in Leicester attended the Trinity College of Music and served in the Royal Air Force in World War II leading RAF No 1 Band of the Middle East Forces. Following wartime service he arranged music for Ted Heath\, Teddy Foster\, Mantovani and many others. He became an arranger and record producer for Decca Records with his orchestra recording for that label and Phase 4 Stereo. His orchestra performed on the albums Mexico and Westward Ho. In December 1964 his orchestra released an album of cover versions of Themes from the James Bond Thrillers to coincide with the American release of Goldfinger. The popularity of Shaw's arrangements of Bond themes led to More Themes from the James Bond Thrillers for the release ofThunderball with tracks from both albums released on a UK album called James Bond in Action. In 1966 Shaw's orchestra performed Themes for Secret Agents.Themes from the James Bond Thrillers Vol.3/More James Bond in Action followed the release of Casino Royale and You Only Live Twice in 1967. Shaw came back in 1971 for The Return of James Bond/The Phase 4 World of Spy Thrillers for the release of Sean Connery's return as Bond in Diamonds Are Forever. Shaw recruited guitarist Vic Flick to repeat his guitar playing on the Gypsy Camp track. Shaw arranged music for films such as Summer Holiday (1963) and The Secret of My Success (1965) and wrote the score for Straight on Till Morning.

COL title VAL The Way He Makes Me Feel COL performer VAL Barbra Streisand	COL video title VAL Nguyên Lê - Purple - Celebrating Jimi Hendrix COL description VAL Guitarist Nguyên Lê pays tribute to Jimi Hendrix by performing ten of the late rock innovator's songs on this 2002 CD. Lê plays in the tradition of Hendrix without directly copying him\, being creative and stretching himself. The occasional vocals by drummer Terri Lyne Carrington\, Aïda Khann\, and Corin Curschellas (which are sometimes spoken as much as sung) are unfortunately not as interesting and are mostly distracting. Bassist Michel Alibo is excellent during his solos and Lê shows originality in his improvisations\, but the music overall is more heartfelt than essential\, particularly since Hendrix's own records are easily available.  Recorded at Studio Davout\, Studio Louxor\, Paris\, France and Systems Two\, New York\, New York between May & June 2002.  Personnel: Nguyên Lê (guitar\, guitar synthesizer); Terri Lyne Carrington (vocals\, drums); Michel Alibo (electric bass).

It was released on their debut album A Flock of Seagulls in 1982 and was its most successful single\, reaching number 9 in the United States and number 1 in Australia.  Single  The single was promoted by a distinctive music video in which the band members performed in a room covered in aluminum foil and mirrors. The cameras used to film the video are clearly visible in many of the background reflections\, their stands also covered in foil. The video is a homage to Brian Eno and Robert Fripp's (No Pussyfooting) album cover\, which was also respectively portrayed by The Strokes for their single\, "The End Has No End" two decades later. The video received heavy rotation on MTV in the summer of 1982\, and helped the single to become a hit. The video features a different edit of "I Ran" than the album version; the introduction was greatly shortened.  The band toured the United States extensively to promote the single\, supporting Squeeze on their 1982 tour. As well as reaching #9 on the Billboard Hot 100\, "I Ran" peaked at #3 on the Mainstream Rock chart and #8 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. Subsequently the album reached number 10 on the Billboard 200.  Despite success in the States and Australia\, the single did not enjoy similar success in the band's home country (United Kingdom)\, failing to make the top 40.  In an interview on the VH1 special 100 Greatest Songs of the '80s\, Mike Score said that he resents the song\, but plays it live because people enjoy it. "I Ran" was listed at #55 on the countdown. In VH1's 100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders of the 80s\, the song was listed at #2\, with Mike Score's interview played again.  Although considered an '80s New Wave classic\, the song experienced somewhat of a revival in 2002 as the signature theme for the video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City; being played during the game's television commercials and during gameplay as one of the songs in the playlist for radio station Wave 103.  Along with the Bowling for Soup cover\, it was also used as the theme song for the English dub of the anime series Knights of the Zodiac which was later removed from the air during its first season.  The song briefly featured in the Dead Zone Season 2 episode 'Playing God'\, heard during a party scene. It can also be heard during a nightclub scene in the 2005 Nick Love film The Business.  The master recording is available as a playable song in Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s as well as the rebooted version of Karaoke Revolution. The song was from the TV show Everybody Hates Chris entitled Everybody Hates the Last Day  It was performed by the Ska Rangers in the film The Hangover: Part II during the closing scene.  Also\, Fez sung a verse in That 70's Show during one of the "Circles" in the fourth season's opener.  Cover versions  "I Ran" has been covered by a number of artists:  Tori Amos covered the song on her Original Sinsuality/Summer Of Sin Tour in Denver\, during Piano Bar Time. Her version was released with the rest of the show in the 3rd CD of The Original Bootlegs.  Assemblage 23 recorded the song for the 1997 compilation Newer Wave.  Cranial Screwtop recorded a version of the song for their 2006 album "Too Fast for Technology".  Terminal Choice's cover of the song is included on the bonus disk of their 2006 album New Born Enemies.  Bowling for Soup covered the song for the 2003 re-release of their album Drunk Enough to Dance and their "Punk Rock 101" single. Both the original and the punk cover are the theme song of the American version of Saint Seiya\, also known as Knights of the Zodiac.  Hidden in Plain View recorded the song on the covers compilation album Punk Goes 80s.  In Dance Dance Revolution: Hottest Party 2\, Spacebar vs Naughty G covered this song.  Darude and Blake Lewis released a cover in 2008.  Nickelback covered the song during their Dark Horse Tour in 2010. It was sung by guitarist/vocalist Ryan Peake.  Slim Thug also took the bass line of this song to produce his single "I Run"  Umphrey's Mcgee covered the song during a performance at the Birmingham Southern College on 4/9/05\, however they have played it many times before.  Ska Rangers covered the song which featured on the film and soundtrack of The Hangover: Part II. COL channel name VAL CoverHeaven	1

Fools Fall In Love  ------------------------  "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" is a song by American punk rock band Green Day. It was released as the second single from their seventh album\, American Idiot. The song was written by Green Day\, with lyrics by lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong. The single peaked at number two in the United States\, making it Green Day's most successful song.  Influences and covers  Noel Gallagher of Oasis criticized Green Day in late 2006\, saying\, "They should have the decency to wait until I am dead [before stealing my songs]. I\, at least\, pay the people I steal from that courtesy"\, referencing the fact that "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" uses the same chord progression as Oasis's hit single "Wonderwall". Gallagher's reaction may have partly been due to the emergence of "Boulevard of Broken Songs"\, a popular mash-up mixed by San Francisco DJ and producer Party Ben in late 2004. The mix consisted of elements from "Boulevard of Broken Dreams"\, "Wonderwall"\, Travis' "Writing to Reach You" and Eminem's "Sing for the Moment"\, which itself has samples from Aerosmith's "Dream On" (another remix by Party Ben featured this\, "Wonderwall" and Kanye West's "Flashing Lights"). This song was covered by Japanese-American singer Hikaru Utada acoustically with a guitar during an internet broadcast in December 2005; a video of it can be found. "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" is sung first and then fades into "Passion" (After the Battle version) from the Kingdom Hearts II original soundtrack. "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" is also featured in the movie trailer of Lords of Dogtown (2005)\, starring Heath Ledger\, Emile Hirsch and John Robinson. Billie Joe Armstrong wrote the song while he was in his son Joey's bedroom.[citation needed] In the 2005 VH1 Storytellers program featuring Green Day\, Billie Joe Armstrong stated that the title of the song was "nicked" from the famous Gottfried Helnwein painting of the same title\, which features James Dean. Four earlier songs also have the same title: an old Harry Warren song\, a Hanoi Rocks song\, a Marianne Faithfull song\, and song by Brian Setzer from his 1986 album The Knife Feels Like Justice Lyrics from the song bear some resemblance to the Pinhead Gunpowder song "I Walk Alone"\, a band in which Billie Joe Armstrong also sings. It appeared on their 1997 album\, Goodbye Ellston Avenue. The song also shares some lyrics with the Whitesnake song "Here I Go Again"\, the words "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" can be found in the lyrics of the Elvis Costello song "Brilliant Mistake"\, the Allman Brothers Band song "End of the Line"\, the Deadsy song "The Key to Gramercy Park"\, and The Ataris song "Road Signs and Rock Songs". The phrase "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" also appears in punk/new wave band Blondie's 1982 minor UK-hit single Island of Lost Souls. A live version of the song can be found on Bullet in a Bible\, a live album of Green Day performing at the Milton Keynes National Bowl. Bluegrass band Cornbread Red did a cover of the song on a tribute album to Green Day Pickin' on Green Day\, while the German choir Gregorian did a cover\, on their Masters of Chant Chapter V album\, in the style of a Gregorian Chant. Mark Mallman covered this song on his MP3-only compilation release Outtakes Vol 1. The song is also featured in Green Day's musical American Idiot\, sung on the cast recording by John Gallagher Jr.\, Rebecca Naomi Jones\, and the rest of the company.

COL title VAL Ehkä suukon antaa saan COL performer VAL Kirka Babitzin	COL video title VAL Eddy Arnold -- I'm Thinking Tonight Of My Blue Eyes (VintageMusic.es) COL description VAL Eddy Arnold\, nacido el 15 de mayo de 1918 en la localidad de Henderson\, condado de Chester\, Tennessee y fallecido el 8 de mayo de 2008 en Franklin\, condado de Williamson\, Tennessee debido a una enfermedad\, fue un músico estadounidense\, especialmente volcado a la música country\, cuyo verdadero nombre era Richard Edward Arnold. Entre su debut en el mundo de la música en 1945 y 1954\, Eddie logró 58 top ten consecutivos\, y nunca marcó menos de un top 40 durante sus 21 años de carrera\, con más de 140 discos diferentes de los cuales se vendieron más de 85 millones de copias\, incluidos eternos clásicos como Bouquet de Rosas o Anytime. Recibió el apodo de Tennessee Plowboy (el chico del arado de Tennessee en inglés)\, y firmó contratos con las compañías discográficas RCA Records y MGM Records.  Richard Edward Arnold nació en Henderson\, en el condado de Chester\, estado de Tennessee\, el 15 de mayo de 1918 y se educó en el medio rural. Su padre era un violinista que alentó a su hijo respecto del desarrollo de sus talentos musicales y logró reunir el dinero suficiente para comprar a su niño una guitarra a la edad de 10 años. Para cuando entró en la escuela secundaria Eddie Arnols ya era toda una estrella local\, pero con la llegada de la Gran Depresión en 1929 y la crisis económica de los años 1930\, Eddy tuvo que dejar la escuela para ayudar trabajar como asistente en una funeraria. Relegó sus actuaciones musicales a funciones locales\, aunque de vez en cuando viajaba montado en una mula con su guitarra a la espalda.  Al igual que otros artistas del country de la época\, Eddy consiguió su pase al estrellato con sus apariciones en vivo por la radio\, antes de debutar en Jackson\, en Tennessee\, en 1936 y posteriormente en San Luis\, en el estado de Misuri.  Entre 1940 y 1943 apareció en el Grand Ole Opry junto a Pee Wee King. Apodado como el chico del arado de Tennessee (o Tennessee Plowboy\, en inglés) firmó con la RCA Victor Records un contrato en 1944 con ese nombre\, que fue el que apareció en sus discos hasta 1954. Con el tema Every hour Seems A Million Years alcanzó el quinto disco de su carrera\, dando con dicho disco comienzo a la cadena de 58 consecutivos éxitos top ten. En 1947 Arnold logró sus tres primeros éxitos número uno\, siendo uno de ellos número uno durante 21 semanas. Eddy Arnold realizó temas universalmente populares convirtiéndose en una estrella perenne\, grabando discos durante un período de cinco décadas\, desde los años 1960 hasta los años 1980; tras una pausa de siete años incluso regresó al estudio en 1990.  Además de establecer un nivel inigualable dada su avanzada edad\, Arnold se convirtió en un ejemplo de cómo manejar su fortuna en el mundo del espectáculo. "Guardo mi primer dólar y sigo ahorrando e invirtiendo mi dinero"\, recuerda\, "nunca olvidé cómo se sentía ser pobre"\, añadió. Eddie Anold se convirtió en uno de los hombres más ricos de la industria mediante la inversión en la única cosa que él consideraba de valor de propiedad\, "la tierra". Debido a su enorme popularidad musical Eddy Arnold se convirtió en un auténtico embajador de la música country a nivel mundial   Spotify:http://open.spotify.com/album/4tQOsxLgCwxPCRNS5LeWxN iTunes:http://itunes.apple.com/es/album/vintage-country-no-11-ep-all/id374306958 Síguenos en: Spotify: https://goo.gl/raouHQ Facebook: https://goo.gl/L92BHL Instagram: https://goo.gl/3oYDGH Web: http://www.vintagemusic.es   Compra nuestros Cd's en formato físico en estas plataformas: Ebay:  http://stores.ebay.com/VintageMusicFm BoutiqAlia: www.boutiqalia-vintagemusic.com Discogs: https://www.discogs.com/es/seller/vintagemusicfm/profile COL channel name VAL VintageMusicFm	0

COL title VAL Here Comes Your Man COL performer VAL Pixies	COL video title VAL LURLEAN HUNTER  Vocal Jazz Swing. Steppin' Out With My Baby \, I Feel COL description VAL Lurlean Hunter  Singer Lurlean Hunter made five albums on her own during the second half of the '50s\, starting out as a Lonesome Gal on RCA and winding up still feeling Blue & Sentimental for Atlantic. She was discovered in Chicago where she had been singing in many clubs\, including a collaboration with drummer Red Saunders that held forth at the Club DeLisa. Hunter's move to New York City in 1955 was prompted by RCA's interest in recording her. The singer's recording career actually began before she left the Windy City at the behest of indie jazz labels\, some of them quite short-lived -- such as Seymour\, with a catalog topping out at four releases. The press described Hunter as a "blues thrush" in announcing her interpretations of three numbers actually written by the label's owner\, producer and record store owner Seymour Schwartz. The latter promotional blurb inevitably told some truth about Hunter's stylistic traits\, if not her relation to winged fauna. Her recordings were more about rhythm & blues and pop than jazz\, yet were done in an era when such sessions often involved fine mainstream jazz players in the accompaniment. The 1956Night Life\, for example\, featured pianist Hank Jones and tenor saxophonist Al Cohn. Blue & Sentimental -- with arrangements by the progressive Jimmy Giuffre -- was reissued in 2000 as a split CD also including an album by fellow singer Betty Bennett\, a former wife of pianist André Previn.Hunter's final recordings were done in 1964\, at which point she was still well under 40 years old. She is known to have died young\, although details of this tragedy are murky. In one version of the story she was knocked off by a mobster lover\, yet whether anybody was really that mean to Lurlean cannot be completely confirmed.

Belying its title—“ambsace” is the lowest throw of dice; snake eyes—the record thrives on a gentle empathy and generosity of spirit\, sitting sneakily protean original compositions alongside gorgeous arrangements of songs by Duke Ellington and The Smiths at the same big hand-hewn table.

COL title VAL It's Gonna Take a Miracle COL performer VAL Barrington Spence	COL video title VAL Laura Nyro - It's gonna take a miracle 1971 COL description VAL Laura Nyro (October 18\, 1947 -- April 8\, 1997) was an American composer\, lyricist\, singer\, and pianist. Her style was a hybrid of Brill Building-style New York pop\, jazz\, gospel\, rhythm and blues\, show tunes\, rock and soul.  She was best known\, and enjoyed her greatest commercial success\, as a composer and lyricist rather than as a performer. Between 1968 and 1970 a number of other singers had significant hits with her songs: The 5th Dimension with "Blowing Away"\, "Wedding Bell Blues"\, "Stoned Soul Picnic"\, "Sweet Blindness"\, "Save The Country" and "Black Patch"; Blood\, Sweat & Tears and Peter\, Paul & Mary with "And When I Die"; Three Dog Night with "Eli's Coming"; and Barbra Streisand with "Stoney End"\, "Time and Love"\, and "Hands off the Man (Flim Flam Man)". Nyro's best-selling single was her recording of Carole King and Gerry Goffin's "Up on the Roof."   Lyrics:  Loving you so I was too blind to see you letting me go But now that you've set me free It's gonna take a miracle Yes\, it's gonna take a miracle To make me love someone new Cause I'm crazy for you  Oh oh\, didn't you know It wouldn't be so easy lettin' you go I could have told you that it's gonna take a miracle  oh-uh Yes\, it's gonna take a miracle To make me love someone new Cause I'm crazy for you  Oh\, tho' I know I can't forget? about you or come so? will show you how much You're turning me around\, destroying me I'll never be the same anymore  You must realize You took your love and left me Quite by surprise You can be sure that now it's gonna take a miracle Yes\, it's gonna take a miracle To make me love someone new Cause I'm crazy for you COL channel name VAL Mr.Lotsopa	1

This album is hard to find and commands a decent price tag but it was re-issued a few years ago and should now be available to a larger audience at last.  In my opinion Ellie Pop were treading their own path in 1968\, there's no fuzz\, no psych touches\, no 1968isms of heavy guitars and keyboards. What you get is a collection of beautifully constructed pop songs that suggest a big Anglophile influence\, in particular mid-60s period Beatles. They sound similar to say The Merry-Go-Round or The Left Banke but without the baroque touches. Just pure pop\, or should I say Ellie Pop.  Virtually every review I've read online or in Shindig for instance\, fails to mention that 'Whatcha Gonna Do 'Bout It' is a cover of a Hollies cut they recorded in 1963 for their debut album 'Stay With The Hollies.' Ellie Pop wrote all of their own tunes except this one!  I'm not certain where Ellie Pop hailed from or even the full names of the group members but it has been suggested elsewhere that they were from Detroit. Maybe someone can confirm this?  http://expo67-cavestones.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/ellie-pop-whatcha-gonna-do-bout-it.html COL channel name VAL ACID REVOLVER	0

Fools Fall In Love  ------------------------  "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" is a song by American punk rock band Green Day. It was released as the second single from their seventh album\, American Idiot. The song was written by Green Day\, with lyrics by lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong. The single peaked at number two in the United States\, making it Green Day's most successful song.  Influences and covers  Noel Gallagher of Oasis criticized Green Day in late 2006\, saying\, "They should have the decency to wait until I am dead [before stealing my songs]. I\, at least\, pay the people I steal from that courtesy"\, referencing the fact that "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" uses the same chord progression as Oasis's hit single "Wonderwall". Gallagher's reaction may have partly been due to the emergence of "Boulevard of Broken Songs"\, a popular mash-up mixed by San Francisco DJ and producer Party Ben in late 2004. The mix consisted of elements from "Boulevard of Broken Dreams"\, "Wonderwall"\, Travis' "Writing to Reach You" and Eminem's "Sing for the Moment"\, which itself has samples from Aerosmith's "Dream On" (another remix by Party Ben featured this\, "Wonderwall" and Kanye West's "Flashing Lights"). This song was covered by Japanese-American singer Hikaru Utada acoustically with a guitar during an internet broadcast in December 2005; a video of it can be found. "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" is sung first and then fades into "Passion" (After the Battle version) from the Kingdom Hearts II original soundtrack. "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" is also featured in the movie trailer of Lords of Dogtown (2005)\, starring Heath Ledger\, Emile Hirsch and John Robinson. Billie Joe Armstrong wrote the song while he was in his son Joey's bedroom.[citation needed] In the 2005 VH1 Storytellers program featuring Green Day\, Billie Joe Armstrong stated that the title of the song was "nicked" from the famous Gottfried Helnwein painting of the same title\, which features James Dean. Four earlier songs also have the same title: an old Harry Warren song\, a Hanoi Rocks song\, a Marianne Faithfull song\, and song by Brian Setzer from his 1986 album The Knife Feels Like Justice Lyrics from the song bear some resemblance to the Pinhead Gunpowder song "I Walk Alone"\, a band in which Billie Joe Armstrong also sings. It appeared on their 1997 album\, Goodbye Ellston Avenue. The song also shares some lyrics with the Whitesnake song "Here I Go Again"\, the words "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" can be found in the lyrics of the Elvis Costello song "Brilliant Mistake"\, the Allman Brothers Band song "End of the Line"\, the Deadsy song "The Key to Gramercy Park"\, and The Ataris song "Road Signs and Rock Songs". The phrase "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" also appears in punk/new wave band Blondie's 1982 minor UK-hit single Island of Lost Souls. A live version of the song can be found on Bullet in a Bible\, a live album of Green Day performing at the Milton Keynes National Bowl. Bluegrass band Cornbread Red did a cover of the song on a tribute album to Green Day Pickin' on Green Day\, while the German choir Gregorian did a cover\, on their Masters of Chant Chapter V album\, in the style of a Gregorian Chant. Mark Mallman covered this song on his MP3-only compilation release Outtakes Vol 1. The song is also featured in Green Day's musical American Idiot\, sung on the cast recording by John Gallagher Jr.\, Rebecca Naomi Jones\, and the rest of the company.

COL title VAL Mr. Magic COL performer VAL Charles Earland\, Carlos Garnett\, Melvin Sparks\, Bernard Purdie	COL video title VAL Mister Magic - Grover Washington\, Jr. (1974) COL description VAL "Mister Magic" was the successful single and title track from the fifth album of one of jazz music's more well-known figures.  Grover Washington\, Jr. (December 12\, 1943 -- December 17\, 1999) was an American jazz-funk / soul-jazz saxophonist.  Along with George Benson\, John Klemmer\, David Sanborn\, Bob James\, Chuck Mangione\, Herb Alpert\, and Spyro Gyra\, he is considered by many to be one of the founders of the smooth jazz genre.  He wrote some of his material and later became an arranger and producer.  Washington was born in Buffalo\, New York on December 12\, 1943.  His mother was a church chorister\, and his father was a collector of old jazz gramophone records and a saxophonist as well\, so music was everywhere in the home.  He grew up with the great jazzmen and big band leaders like Benny Goodman\, Fletcher Henderson\, and others like them.  At the age of 8\, with the desire for him to be more than he could be\, Grover Sr. gave Jr. a saxophone.  He practiced and would sneak into clubs to see famous Buffalo blues musicians.  Washington left Buffalo and played with a Midwest group called the Four Clefs.  He was drafted into the U.S. Army shortly thereafter\, but this was to be to his advantage\, as he met drummer Billy Cobham there.  Cobham\, a mainstay in New York City\, introduced Washington to many New York musicians.  After leaving the Army\, Washington freelanced his talents around New York City\, eventually landing in Philadelphia in 1967.  In 1970 and 1971\, he appeared on Leon Spencer's first two albums on Prestige Records\, together with Idris Muhammad and Melvin Sparks.  Washington's big break came at the expense of another artist.  Alto sax man Hank Crawford was unable to make a recording date with Creed Taylor's Kudu Records\, and Washington took his place\, even though he was a backup.  This led to his first solo album\, "Inner City Blues".  He was talented and displayed heart and soul with soprano\, alto\, tenor\, and baritone saxophones.  Refreshing for his time\, he made headway into the jazz mainstream.  His fifth album\, 1974's "Mister Magic"\, was a commercial success\, and introduced guitarist Eric Gale as a near-permanent member in Washington's arsenal.  Throughout the 1970s and 1980s\, Washington made some of the genre's most memorable hits\, including "Mr. Magic" and "Black Frost.  In addition\, he performed very frequently with other artists\, including Bill Withers on "Just The Two Of Us" (still in regular rotation on radio today)\, Patti LaBelle on "The Best Is Yet To Come" and Phyllis Hyman on "A Sacred Kind Of Love".  He is also remembered for his take on the Dave Brubeck classic "Take Five"\, and for his 1996 version of "Soulful Strut".  On December 17\, 1999\, while waiting in the green room after taping four songs for "The Saturday Early Show" at CBS Studios in New York City\, Washington collapsed.  He was taken to St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital\, where he was pronounced dead at about 7:30 p.m.  He was 56 years old.  His doctors determined that he had suffered a massive heart attack.

COL description VAL 118 years ago to this date\, an event would transpire that would serve as the basis for the murder ballad Duncan and Brady that is still commonly played to this day. On October 6\, 1880\, Patrolman James Brady was shot and killed at the Charles Starkes Saloon in downtown Saint Louis\, Missouri. A man by the name of Harry Duncan would be arrested\, convicted and executed for the crime.  The prevailing legend is that the crime was something of a reaction to police harassment of African-Americans in the area\, which at the time was the "red light" district of Saint Louis. It all started with a simple brawl at the saloon that exploded into gunfire when police arrived on the scene and tried to take suspects into custody. Brady was hit in the hail of bullets and would die from his wounds. COL channel name VAL David Albion	0

COL title VAL Jóga COL performer VAL Ane Brun	COL video title VAL Rudy A Message To You - The Locomotive (1967) COL description VAL Locomotive formed in Birmingham\, England originally as a jazz band and by the mid 60s they were taking great influence from early ska music brought to the city by Jamaicans who were finding work in the industrial heartland of Britain.   Although there were other white musicians dabbling in Jamaican Ska in the early 60s\, Locomotive were possibly the earliest British band to experiment with Ska in an authentic way\, and as a white 'band' were probably quite ahead of their time considering they made it to vinyl.    While Brumbeat bands and artists such as 'Spencer Davis Group'\, 'The Move' and 'Robert Plant' were mimicking the blues of black America\, Locomotive were looking more to the West Indies for their inspiration\, which\, today\, could be considered a short-cut to a cooler sound than black American blues\, which by this time had taken a step in a completely different direction "heavy metal".  Locomotive's later styles included Soul\, Psychedelia and a fade into the prog rock era with Norman Haines eventually going it alone.  This is the first cover of Dandy Livingstone's "Rudy A Message To You"\, recorded in the same year as the original in late 1967 and is B-Side to "Broken Heart" on the Direction label. It was recorded over a decade before the seminal Specials version.   There were several notable band members such as Chris Wood who went on to join supergroup 'Traffic'\,  Mike Kellie of 'Spooky Tooth' and Bob Lamb who was the producer for 70s dub reggae band 'UB40'.

COL title VAL You Got Me Hummin' COL performer VAL Sam & Dave	COL video title VAL "Motown Classics" "Kim Weston Take Me In Your Arms (Rock Me A Little While) Alternate Version" COL description VAL "This is an alternate vocal take of the classic Motown hit\, "Take Me In Your Arms (Rock Me A Little While)"  "Kim Weston- ask any avid Motown fan\, the ones REALLY additcted to the label's music\, about Kim Weston and I'll make a bet that 100% of them will tell you Motown REALLY dropped the ball on a phenomenal talent...  Here is an alternate version of perhaps Kim's best-known song for the company (at least\, best-known to the public in general.)     Take Me In Your Arms (Rock Me A Little While) was a firestorm that came from the forever-astonishing team of Holland-Dozier-Holland.  Eddie Holland actually put his vocals down first.  Notes from the Kim Weston Motown Anthology state that the song was slated for Martha and the Vandellas.  The song was then assigned to Kim\, and Motown's studio A caught fire and disintigrated.  How the studio didn't burn to the ground as this woman lit fire to the already-burning H-D-H track is a mystery.  The commercial version certainly was a firecracker but this alternate version recently released...  fire alarms will sound\,  walls will crumble\,  speakers will explode\,  you'll be turned into ashes.  I don't know\, maybe Kim decided to just give it hell\, maybe H-D-H wanted one more take and Kim was tired and decided if they wanted one more take\, then she would give them something they'd never forget.  Whatever factored into this take\, Kim takes the vocals to asonishingly explosive heights and hits notes that must have brought down any and all aircraft flying in the vicinity of Hitsville U.S.A.  Notice too her lightning-fast phrasing going into the choruses  (almost like those triple-time raps hip hop artists pull of so easily today.)    People must have really been paying attention to this song because the Doobie Brothers did a cover of the song that accomplished the fantastic feat of sounding thouroughly like a Doobie Brothers original and yet keeping a lot of that fantastic\, classic Motown Sound at the same time.    Kim Weston was a woman who was able to shift gears easily between the Motown Sound and ballads and standards.  Wonderfully\, there have been recent releases on cd to showcase all of her amazing recordings as well as the ones that were kept in the vaults.  Here is just one of those tracks that were kept behind\, so enjoy and keep the fire extinguisher nearby!  Special notice should be given to Benny Benjamin's explosive drumming on this song.  I don't know the correct term for it\, but to me it's like a double-time swing beat.  To keep that beat in perfect time is amazing enough\, but to toss in those trademark Benjamin drum fills is almost unbelievable. I don't know of anyone else who could toss those fills in and make it sound so easy."  also: "it takes two marvin gaye and kim weston" "kim weston helpless" "the doobie brothers take me in your arms (rock me a little while)"  "Greatest Motown Songs Of All Time - Motown Classic Songs Playlist - Best Motown Music Hits 60's Kim Weston Songs  Motown Songs" COL channel name VAL Motown Deep Cuts\, PAMS Jingles & More with Tomovox	0

Draper (25 enero 1923 hasta 28 marzo 2003)\,  conocido profesionalmente como Rusty Draper \, era un cantante americano de Pop que logró su mayor éxito en la década de 1950.  Nacido en Kirksville\, Missouri (el apodo de "Rusty" era por su pelo rojo) comenzó a actuar en el programa de radio de su tío en Tulsa \, Oklahoma a mediados de la década de 1930. Draper pasó a trabajar en las estaciones de radio en Des Moines \, Iowa  (veces tomando el lugar del locutor deportivo Ronald Reagan) \, y en Illinois antes de instalarse en California . Allí comenzó a cantar en  clubes \, convirtiéndose en el cantante oficial del casino de San Francisco . A principios de la década de 1950 había empezado a aparecer en programas de televisión nacionales\, incluyendo The Ed Sullivan Show (CBS) y Ozark Jubilee (ABC).  En 1952\, Draper firmó con Mercury Records y lanzó su primera grabación  \, "How Could You (ojos azules)". Al año siguiente\, después de una gira nacional de clubes\, su versión de  Jim Lowe's "Gambler's Guitar" 's llegó al N º 6 en las listas de éxitos de todo el paçis\, y vendió un millón de copias\, consiguiendo  un disco de oro.  Tras una serie de éxitos menores\, volvió a lo más alto en 1955 con "Seventeen" (N º 18)\, "El Shifting\, Whispering Sands" (N º 3) y "Are You Satisfied?" (No. 11)\, convirtiéndose en uno de los cantantes  de pop  con más éxito de la época.  En 1962\, firmó con con Monument Records \, con cada vez menos éxito en las listas ya que su estilo se fue quedando anticuado. Sin embargo\, él continuó teniendo éxitos menores durante la década de 1960.  Apareció en musicales de teatro y en la televisión\,  Draper murió de neumonía \, en Bellevue\, Washington \, a la edad de 80 años.

Written by musician and civil rights activist Oscar Brown\, Jr.\, the song has been covered by artists as diverse as Abbey Lincoln and Johnny Rivers.

They told me that you came this way Brother\, where are you? They said you came this way  The eyes of the people who passed him by Were cold and hard as stone The poor boy whimpered and began to cry Because he was all alone  Brother\, where are you? They told me that you came this way Brother\, where are you? They said you came this way  Now there are many Who will swear that it's true That brothers are we all Yet it seems there are very few Who will answer a brother's call  Brother\, where are you?

COL title VAL The Beggin' COL performer VAL Bob Fox & Stu Luckley	COL video title VAL Streets of Baltimore - Nanci Griffith and John Prine COL description VAL from her album\, "Other Voices\, Too - A Trip Back to Bountiful"\, released in 1998. This is Nanci's 15th album and she is joined with other artists. She considers this a follow up to her album\, "Other Voices\, Other Rooms" which was released in 1993. In this album her focus on songwriters is so much a part of the album's spirit. The writers whose songs Nanci has selected range from the well-known\, like British folk-pop artists Richard Thompson and Sandy Denny\, early American rocker Sonny Curtis\, American folksingers Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger and country legend Johnny Cash\, to lesser known writers like John Grimaudo\, Saylor White\, Ian Tyson and Texas songwriter Mickie Merkens\, to Stephen Foster\, perhaps the greatest American songwriter of the 19th century. "We started with several songs that spilled over from the last album\, like Richard Thompson's 'Wall Of Death' and Stephen Foster's 'Hard Times Come Again No More\,' then we went back to the list of songs I felt weren't sung enough".  At times\, we had so many people in the studio -- like when we had 37 for "Wasn't That A Mighty Storm" -- and they wouldn't leave! The beer was free\, the food was good\, everyone got to meet their heroes. It was just so exciting to bring people together.  quotes from Nanci Griffith found on the site homepages.sover.net/~rschrull/ngriffith/othertoo/othertoo.html  I do not own this song.

When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong\, Juliet?  Come up on different streets\, they're both the streets of shame. Both dirty\, both mean\, yes\, in the dream it was just the same And I dreamed your dream for you and now your dream is real. How can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals?  When you can fall for chains of silver\,  You can fall for chains of gold\, You can fall for pretty strangers  And the promises they hold. You promised me everything\, you promised me thick and thin\, yeah! Now you just say\, "Oh Romeo? Yeah\, you know I used to have a scene with him".  Juliet\, when we made love\, you used to cry. You said\, "I love you like the stars above\, I'll love you 'til I die". There's a place for us\, you know the movie song. When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong\, Juliet?  I can't do the talk\, like the talk on TV And I can't do a love song\, like the way it's meant to be. I can't do everything\, but I'll do anything for you. I can't do anything\, 'cept be in love with you! And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be. All I do is keep the beat... and bad company. Now all I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme\, Juliet\, I'd do the stars with you any time!  Juliet\, when we made love you used to cry. You said\, "I love you like the stars above\, I'll love you 'til I die". There's a place for us\, you know the movie song. When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong\, Juliet?

I was very impressed by her and she gave Gastonia a lot of recognition at the time of her record release. Her first song was "Please Don't Talk To The Lifeguard" and the song was continuously played on the radio with moderate success. There was a popular radio station 'WGAS" in Gastonia\, NC that played her album songs every hour on the hour to promote "The Exciting Years" and most of us had her album also. Hope you enjoy the song and slideshow. COL channel name VAL David Carpenter	0

Zijn nieuwe album "Jo Vally Zingt Country" dat in Oktober verscheen bleek een schot in de roos en is inmiddels haast goed voor goud. Het nieuwe jaar is nog kersvers maar het bracht al meteen goed nieuws\, Jo heeft een MIA-nominatie op zak in de categorie Vlaams Populair! Het wordt nu spannend afwachten voor hem tot 8 februari wanneer de prijzen van de prestigieuze awards zullen worden uitgedeeld. Voor Jo zelf voelt de nominatie an sich al als een persoonlijke overwinning\, een bevestiging dat hij met zijn Countryplaat de juiste weg is ingeslagen.  Na Jo's vorige single 'Calypso' werd het stilaan tijd voor een nieuwe single uit het nieuwe album en dat wordt "Geluk Kan Komen En Gaan". Het nummer wordt hiermee  Jo's nieuwe voorjaarssingle en blijkt onder de fans van Jo Vally één van de topfavorieten te zijn\, het houdt dan ook mooi het midden tussen de countrystijl en het eigen repertoire van Jo.  En net zoals voor de vorige singles werd ook voor dit nummer de clip in Hollywood geshoot\, ditmaal vormt een verlaten cowboydorp het decor.

COL title VAL Rudy - A Message to You COL performer VAL The Locomotive [1]	COL video title VAL Peggy Lee - He's My Guy COL description VAL Peggy Lee's alluring tone\, distinctive delivery\, breadth of material\, and ability to write many of her own songs made her one of the most captivating artists of the vocal era\, from her breakthrough on the Benny Goodman hit "Why Don't You Do Right" to her many solo successes\, singles including "Mañana\," "Lover" and "Fever" that showed her bewitching vocal power\, a balance between sultry swing and impeccable musicianship.  Born Norma Egstrom in Jamestown\, North Dakota\, she suffered the death of her mother at the age of four and endured a difficult stepmother after her father remarried. Given her sense of swing by listening to Count Basie on the radio\, she taught herself to sing and made her radio debut at the age of 14. She made the jump to Fargo (where she was christened Peggy Lee)\, then to Minneapolis and St. Louis to sing with a regional band. Lee twice journeyed to Hollywood to make her fortune\, but returned unsuccessful from both trips.  She finally got her big break in 1941\, when a vocal group she worked with began appearing at a club in Chicago. While there\, she was heard by Benny Goodman\, whose regular vocalist Helen Forrest was about to leave his band. Lee recorded with Goodman just a few days later\, debuting with the popular "Elmer's Tune" despite a good deal of nerves. That same year\, several songs became commercial successes including "I Got It Bad (And That Ain't Good)" and "Winter Weather." In 1943\, "Why Don't You Do Right" became her first major hit\, but she left the Goodman band (and the music industry altogether) later that year after marrying Goodman's guitarist\, Dave Barbour.  After just over a year of domestic life\, Peggy Lee returned to music\, first as part of an all-star jazz album. Then\, in late 1945\, Capitol signed her to a solo contract and she hit the charts with her first shot\, "Waitin' for the Train to Come In." Lee continued to score during the late '40s\, with over two dozen chart entries before the end of the decade\, including "It's a Good Day\," "Mañana (Is Soon Enough for Me)" -- the most popular song of 1948 -- and "I Don't Know Enough About You." Many of her singles were done in conjunction with Barbour\, her frequent writing and recording partner.  After moving to Decca in 1952\, Peggy Lee scored with the single "Lover" and an LP\, Songs From Pete Kelly's Blues recorded with Ella Fitzgerald (both singers also made appearances in the film). She spent only five years at Decca however\, before moving back to Capitol. There\, she distinguished herself through recording a wide variety of material\, including songs -- and occasionally\, entire LPs -- influenced by the blues\, Latin and cabaret as well as pop. Lee also used many different settings\, like an orchestra conducted by none other than Frank Sinatra for 1957's The Man I Love\, the George Shearing Quintet for 1959's live appearance Beauty and the Beat\, Quincey Jones as arranger and conductor for 1961's If You Go\, and arrangements by Benny Carter on 1963's Mink Jazz. Barbour's problems with alcoholism ended their marriage\, though they remained good friends until his death in 1965.  Peggy Lee was an early advocate of rock and made a quick transition into rock-oriented material. Given her depth and open mind for great songs no matter the source\, it wasn't much of a surprise that she sounded quite comfortable covering the more song-oriented end of late-'60s rock\, including great choices by Jimmy Webb\, Buffy Sainte-Marie\, Burt Bacharach\, Randy Newman\, Goffin & King and John Sebastian. She nearly brushed the Top Ten in 1969 with Leiber & Stoller's "Is That All There Is?" She continued recording contemporary material until 1972's Norma Deloris Egstrom From Jamestown\, North Dakota brought her back to her roots. It was her last LP for Capitol\, however. Lee recorded single LPs for Atlantic\, A&M\, Polydor UK and DRG before effectively retiring at the beginning of the 1980s. She returned in 1988 with two LPs for Music Masters that revisited her earlier successes. Her last album\, Moments Like This\, was recorded in 1992 for Chesky. Her voice was effectively silenced after a 1998 stroke\, and she died of a heart attack at her Bel Air home in early 2002. ~ John Bush\, All Music Guide  PLEASE NOTE:  I divided my uploads among multiple channels\,  Bookmark this link in your browser for instant access to an index with links to all of John1948's oldies classics.

COL title VAL Jimmy Brown the Newsboy COL performer VAL Rick and Thel	COL video title VAL A.R. Scammell The Squid Jiggin' Ground Part 1 (with lyrics) COL description VAL Oh\, this is the place where the fishermen gather\,  With oilskins and boots and Cape Anns battened down;  All sizes of figures with squid lines and jiggers\,  They congregate here on the squid-jigging ground.   Some are workin' their jiggers while others are yarnin'\,  There's some standin' up and there's more lyin' down;  While all kinds of fun\, jokes and tricks are begun  As they wait for the squid on the squid-jiggin' ground.   There's men of all ages and boys in the bargain;  There's old Billy Cave and there's young Raymond Brown\,  There's a red rantin' Tory out here in a dory\,  A-runnin' down Squires on the squid-jiggin' ground.   There's men from the Harbour and men from the Tickle\,  In all kinds of motorboats\, green\, grey and brown;  Right yonder is Bobby and with him is Nobby\,  He's chawin' hard tack on the squid-jiggin' ground.   God bless my sou'wester\, there's Skipper John Chaffey\,  He's the best hand at squid-jiggin' here\, I'll be bound.  Hello! What's the row? Why he's jiggin' one now\,  The very first squid on the squid-jiggin' ground.   The man with the whiskers is old Jacob Steele;  He's gettin well up but he's still pretty sound.  While Uncle Bob Hawkins wears six pair o' stockin's  Whenever he's out on the squid-jiggin' ground.   Holy smoke! What a scuffle! All hands are excited.  'Tis a wonder to me that there's nobody drowned.  There's confusion\, a bustle\, a wonderful hustle\,  They're all jiggin' squids on the squid-jiggin' ground.   Says Bobby\, "The squids are on top of the water\,  I just got me jigger 'bout one fathom down" ---  When a squid in the boat squirted right down his throat\,  And he's swearin' like mad on the squid-jiggin' ground.   There's poor Uncle Billy\, his whiskers are spattered  With spots of the squid juice that's flying around;  One poor little b'y got it right in the eye\,  But they don't give a damn on the squid-jiggin' ground.   Now if ever you feel inclined to go squiddin'\,  Leave your white shirts and collars behind in the town.  And if you get cranky without your silk hanky  You'd better steer clear of the squid-jiggin' ground.   Found in a used record store dollar bin in Sydney\, Cape Breton\, NS\, 2002.

COL title VAL There Is a Mountain COL performer VAL Little Man	COL video title VAL Joanie Sommers – “Step Inside Love” (Happy Tiger) 1968 COL description VAL Written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Arranged by  Capps and produced by Joseph Porter.  Joanie\, who scored a #7 US hit with “Johnny Get Angry” in the summer of 1962\, didn’t return to Hot-100 after “When The Boys Get Together” charted in October of the same year.  Some great records followed on Warners\, however\, including the northern soul favorite\, “Don’t Pity Me” in 1965. By 1967\, Joanie was with Columbia and following year with Capitol but still the hits continued to elude her – notwithstanding the quality of her recordings.  “Step Inside Love” had been a #8 UK hit for Cilla Black during Cilla’s ten year chart run from the early 60s.  The Happy Tiger label was owned by the Flying Tiger Line\, an air freight company. The label ran from 1968-71 and was home to artists such as Donnie Brooks\, Priscilla Paris and Them.

Some day you'll return to  Your valleys and your farms  And you'll no longer burn  To be brothers in arms.    Through these fields of destruction  Baptism of fire  I've witnessed your suffering  As the battle raged higher.  And though they did hurt me so bad  In my fear and alarm  You did not desert me  My brothers in arms.    There's so many different worlds  So many different suns  And we have just one world  But we live in different ones.    Now the sun's gone to hell  And the moon's riding high  Let me bid you farewell  Every man has to die.  But it's written in the starlight  And every line in your palm  We're fools to make war  On our brothers in arms... COL channel name VAL UFCHeadhunter	1

COL title VAL Take a Message to Mary COL performer VAL Chet Atkins	COL video title VAL "How Ya Gonna Keep 'Em Down on the Farm?" (Nora Bayes\, 1919) COL description VAL America was as quick in getting out of Europe following World War One as she was tardy in entering that conflict. As a nation\, we were forever transformed...America's involvement in World War One brought a change of character with it\, and that change was felt nowhere more keenly than Rural America. Looking back\, the family farm has been in decline ever since. Walter Donaldson wrote the music to this in 1919 (Joe Young and Sam M. Lewis wrote the words)\, and the song wound up being an overnight smash hit. It was recorded by nearly everyone\, but no rendition was more sublimely spirited than this one\, recorded for Columbia by Nora Bayes - a vaudeville talent of legendary proportions.   HOW YA GONNA KEEP 'EM DOWN ON THE FARM?  Reuben\, Reuben\, I've been thinking Said his wifey dear Now that all is peaceful and calm The boys will soon be back on the farm Mister Reuben started winking and slowly rubbed his chin He pulled his chair up close to mother And he asked her with a grin  How ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm After they've seen Paree' How ya gonna keep 'em away from Broadway Jazzin around and paintin' the town How ya gonna keep 'em away from harm\, that's a mystery They'll never want to see a rake or plow And who the deuce can parleyvous a cow? How ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm After they've seen Paree'?  How ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm After they've seen Paree' How ya gonna keep 'em away from Broadway Jazzin around and paintin' the town How ya gonna keep 'em away from harm\, that's a mystery Imagine Reuben when he meets his Pa He'll kiss his cheek and holler "OO-LA-LA! How ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm After they've seen Paree'? COL channel name VAL RReady555	0

Come a little bit closer\, you're my kind of man So big and so strong Come a little bit closer\, I'm all alone And the night is so long. Hmmmm. So we started to dance\, in my arms she felt so inviting Mmmmmm\, I just couldn't resist\, a-just a-one little kiss so exciting Then I heard the guitar player say\, va-moose\, Jose's on his way And I knew\, yes I knew\, I should run\, but then I heard her say. Come a little bit closer\, you're my kind of man So big and so strong Come a little bit closer\, I'm all alone And the night is so long. Ha\, ha\, ha\, alright. Laaa-laaa\, la-la\, laaa-laaa\, la-la Laaa-laaa\, la-la\, laaa-laaa\, la-la Then the music stopped\, when I looked\, the cafe was empty Then I heard Jose say\, man\, you know you're in trouble plenty So I dropped my drink from my hand\, and out through the window I ran And as I rode away\, I could hear her say to Jose. Come a little bit closer\, you're my kind of man So big and so strong Come a little bit closer\, I'm all alone And the night is so long. Come a little bit closer\, you're my kind of man So big and so strong Come a little bit closer\, I'm all alone And the night is so long.

Fools Fall In Love  ------------------------  "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" is a song by American punk rock band Green Day. It was released as the second single from their seventh album\, American Idiot. The song was written by Green Day\, with lyrics by lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong. The single peaked at number two in the United States\, making it Green Day's most successful song.  Influences and covers  Noel Gallagher of Oasis criticized Green Day in late 2006\, saying\, "They should have the decency to wait until I am dead [before stealing my songs]. I\, at least\, pay the people I steal from that courtesy"\, referencing the fact that "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" uses the same chord progression as Oasis's hit single "Wonderwall". Gallagher's reaction may have partly been due to the emergence of "Boulevard of Broken Songs"\, a popular mash-up mixed by San Francisco DJ and producer Party Ben in late 2004. The mix consisted of elements from "Boulevard of Broken Dreams"\, "Wonderwall"\, Travis' "Writing to Reach You" and Eminem's "Sing for the Moment"\, which itself has samples from Aerosmith's "Dream On" (another remix by Party Ben featured this\, "Wonderwall" and Kanye West's "Flashing Lights"). This song was covered by Japanese-American singer Hikaru Utada acoustically with a guitar during an internet broadcast in December 2005; a video of it can be found. "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" is sung first and then fades into "Passion" (After the Battle version) from the Kingdom Hearts II original soundtrack. "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" is also featured in the movie trailer of Lords of Dogtown (2005)\, starring Heath Ledger\, Emile Hirsch and John Robinson. Billie Joe Armstrong wrote the song while he was in his son Joey's bedroom.[citation needed] In the 2005 VH1 Storytellers program featuring Green Day\, Billie Joe Armstrong stated that the title of the song was "nicked" from the famous Gottfried Helnwein painting of the same title\, which features James Dean. Four earlier songs also have the same title: an old Harry Warren song\, a Hanoi Rocks song\, a Marianne Faithfull song\, and song by Brian Setzer from his 1986 album The Knife Feels Like Justice Lyrics from the song bear some resemblance to the Pinhead Gunpowder song "I Walk Alone"\, a band in which Billie Joe Armstrong also sings. It appeared on their 1997 album\, Goodbye Ellston Avenue. The song also shares some lyrics with the Whitesnake song "Here I Go Again"\, the words "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" can be found in the lyrics of the Elvis Costello song "Brilliant Mistake"\, the Allman Brothers Band song "End of the Line"\, the Deadsy song "The Key to Gramercy Park"\, and The Ataris song "Road Signs and Rock Songs". The phrase "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" also appears in punk/new wave band Blondie's 1982 minor UK-hit single Island of Lost Souls. A live version of the song can be found on Bullet in a Bible\, a live album of Green Day performing at the Milton Keynes National Bowl. Bluegrass band Cornbread Red did a cover of the song on a tribute album to Green Day Pickin' on Green Day\, while the German choir Gregorian did a cover\, on their Masters of Chant Chapter V album\, in the style of a Gregorian Chant. Mark Mallman covered this song on his MP3-only compilation release Outtakes Vol 1. The song is also featured in Green Day's musical American Idiot\, sung on the cast recording by John Gallagher Jr.\, Rebecca Naomi Jones\, and the rest of the company.

COL title VAL Step It up and Go COL performer VAL John Jackson	COL video title VAL Wayne King & His Orchestra - Goofus (1930) COL description VAL Wayne King\, born Harold Wayne King\, (February 16\, 1901  July 16\, 1985) was an American musician\, songwriter\, singer and orchestral leader. He was sometimes referred to as "the Waltz King" because most of his popular music involved waltzes; "The Waltz You Saved For Me" was his Theme Song. Born in Savanna\, Illinois\, King was an impressive athlete in high school\, and briefly played professional football with the Canton Bulldogs. He also attended Valparaiso University in Indiana for two years\, but left to begin a career in music. After playing saxophone for the Paul Whiteman Orchestra\, he created "Wayne King and Orchestra" in 1927. King's innovations included converting Carrie Jacobs-Bond's "I Love You Truly" from its original 2/4 time over to 3/4. The orchestra disbanded during World War II\, and King joined the army\, advancing to the rank of major. The orchestra was reestablished in 1946. King's orchestra had a television show in Chicago from 1949 to 1952. He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the Radio category.  In later years he operated a Black Angus cattle farm and a car rental business. In early 1958 he appeared as a guest challenger on the TV panel show "To Tell The Truth". He released a Christmas album on Decca Records\, Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\, in 1963. King's orchestra played its last engagement in March 1983 at the Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall in Sarasota\, Florida. COL channel name VAL ASACurator	0

Superb early release on the Green Zonophone Label\, probably in the late 1920s\, with the serial no 5465 of this highly popular song. originally written by Woolsey And Sauer When Its Springtime In The Rockies.  I am not sure if it is the first release\, but certanly is ether early or late 1920s\, 30's or maybe before that.  Difficult to tell as one of my complaints about these old 78s is unlike their successors\, they never put the date of release on them. COL channel name VAL Sliepnir2006	0

This was one of his biggest hits\, charting at #25 in 1930 for the year. Also a big(ger) hit for Nat Skrillet in the same year.  Photo is of the Regents Club Dance Hall In Brighton\, England. It was converted to a bingo hall in 1967 and then bulldozed in 1974\, a victim of changing taste in dance music.  50 hits on 9/26/11 100 hits on 11/10/11 250 hits on 3/16/12 500 htis on 9/6/12 COL channel name VAL MusicProjectX	0

COL title VAL Some Velvet Morning COL performer VAL Slowdive	COL video title VAL Nancy Sinatra & Lee Hazlewood: Some Velvet Morning COL description VAL The second song I ever really loved.   I have loved & lived with this song all my life and it is one of my favourite top 10 tracks of all time.   Track Meaning:  One day when the male character in the song is sober and has his head "straight"\, he will impart something of significance to his current love about his earliest & deepest love\, a woman named "pheadra" whose memory he is still haunted by.  Hence the repetition of the Pheadra/ Nancy portion of the song . . .  her section symbolising the "haunting" and struggle inside his head as he tries to gain "closure" from this past relationship with a mysterious former love Pheadra . . . his part of the song being directed to his new lover in the present.    His present lack of sobriety (drunkeness) describing his vain attempts to drown out the all consuming memory of this mysterious former love\, a memory that he is aware is annoying his present lover and describes his fear that she may leave him as a result of his "haunting" by his old (first)love.  Note:  At the point in history this song was written the labels of "straight" (meaning hetrosexual) and "gay" (meaning homosexual) did not yet exist.

COL title VAL For You COL performer VAL Rick Nelson	COL video title VAL The Crazy World of Arthur Brown-Fire  (1968) COL description VAL "Fire" is a 1968 song by Arthur Brown\, Vincent Crane\, Mike Finesilver and Peter Ker. Performed by the Crazy World of Arthur Brown\, it was released as a single and on the band's debut album\, also called The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. The single made #1 in the UK (in August 1968) and Canada. In October\, it made #2 in the US Billboard charts and #19 in Australia. It also made number 6 in The Netherlands.  The song is an example of the psychedelic rock of the period\, though its lack of guitars distinguished it from many of its contemporaries. The lead instrument in this case was Vincent Crane's Hammond electronic organ\, augmented by an orchestral section featuring prominent brass. The singer's opening proclamation of himself as "the god of hellfire" became a lasting epithet.  *i posted this video only for entertainment purposes* COL channel name VAL elodd90	0
